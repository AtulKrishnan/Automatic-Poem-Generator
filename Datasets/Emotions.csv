0,Emotion,JoyPoemsJoyAndPeaceAndLovePoembyCarmelaPatterson,"Year's end is swiftly encroaching,
Leaving the present year behind,
The New Year is fast approaching,
The goals we sought, did we find?
Were we satisfied with mediocrity?
Did we strive for so much less?
Did we flaunt an air of superiority?
Did we make of ourselves a pitiable mess?
The time is coming for a new resolution
The New Year offers new promise and hope
We plead with God for  His absolution
And trust in His mercy to help us cope.
Starting afresh, let us begin the New Year
By recalling His Tenets and  His Law
Remembering that He is always near
Ready to catch us if and when we fall.
Seas may rage and oceans may heave
And fall we shall ~ but do not always fear it
For Jesus told us that He will never leave
Through the Power of His Holy Spirit.
Spiritual things are seen and unseen
It is within the soul we come to know it;
In evaluating our walk we see where we've been
Growing in holiness ~ or ~ wallowing in sin
Forgiveness is needed without a doubt
And when it is given we want to shout
for and with
Joy and Peace and Love
All Blessings from God above!
Joy and Peace and Love! !
Joy and Peace and Love! ! !
Let's begin the New Year
with renewed
JOY and PEACE and LOVE"

I am but two days old.'
What shall I call thee?
'I happy am,
Joy is my name.'
Sweet joy befall thee!
Pretty joy!
Sweet joy, but two days old.
Sweet Joy I call thee:
Thou dost smile,
I sing the while;
Sweet joy befall thee!"

3,Emotion,JoyPoemsAndYouWillShedTearsOfJoyPoembyANJALISINHA,"My love so intense
like fragrant musk’s incense
Would
permeate you
hypnotize you
anesthetize you
And you will shed tears of Joy.
My love so hot
like blazing sunspots
Would torment you
torture you
tantalize you
And you will shed tears of Joy.
My love so calm,
like soothing divine balm
Would comfort you
caress you
heal you
And you will shed tears of Joy.
My love so high
like majestic sky
Would shelter you
protect you
comfort you
And you will shed tears of Joy.
My love so forgiver
like pristine pure river
Would cleanse you
purify you
rectify you
And you will shed tears of Joy.
My love so divine
like Old bottled wine
Would energize you
galvanize you
divinize you
And you will shed tears of Joy.
My passion
emanating from divine station
would shock you
rock you
knock you
And you will shed tears of joy.
My emotions
healing as divine potion
would envelope you
embrace you
embarrass you
And you will shed tears of joy.
My divine eyes
calmer than sky
would chase you
daze you
amaze you
My Baby!
And you will shed tears of joy.

4,Emotion,JoyPoemsTzUNo2WineJoyPoembyLiChingChao,"To the tune ""As in a Dream""
I have long remembered
the pavilion
on the stream
the falling sun
so deep in wine
we did not know
the way home
how pleasure spent
late returning
the skiff
thoughtless
entered
a lotus deep place
and struggling through
struggling through
we scared up
from the sand
gulls and herons."
5,Emotion,JoyPoemsJoyAndSorrowPoembyJohannWolfgangvonGoethe,"As a fisher-boy I fared
To the black rock in the sea,
And, while false gifts I prepared.
Listen'd and sang merrily,
Down descended the decoy,
Soon a fish attack'd the bait;
One exultant shout of joy,--
And the fish was captured straight.
Ah! on shore, and to the wood
Past the cliffs, o'er stock and stone,
One foot's traces I pursued,
And the maiden was alone.
Lips were silent, eyes downcast
As a clasp-knife snaps the bait,
With her snare she seized me fast,
And the boy was captured straight.
Heav'n knows who's the happy swain
That she rambles with anew!
I must dare the sea again,
Spite of wind and weather too.
When the great and little fish
Wail and flounder in my net,
Straight returns my eager wish
In her arms to revel yet!"
6,Emotion,JoyPoemsFieldsOfJoyPoembyDónallDempsey,"I see you
coming through these fields of joy
through the blaze of wheat
lost in
this shimmering heat
haze
with & without
form
now a scarlet dress
now nothing but a flame
burning
in the distance
my heart
flaming with desire
at the thought of the touch of your hand
the ordinary everyday miracle of your smile
transforming itself into the mystery of your kiss
I see you
coming through
my fields of joy
a red flame
disguising itself
as a woman
shimmering through wheat
my heart lost
in this haze of heat
my voice
erases
the distance
closes down
the distance
longing for
the nearness
of your nearness
my words
set free to the sky
fly
into the shape
that birds would make
if they could write:
“I love you! ”
across this blue
you
waving
waving
at my voice"

9,Emotion,JoyPoemsAnOldManSearchForJoyPoembyKelvinBroadwater,"Can a man of old age find joy in his day of old?
Truly there is joy and light! If he search in the
Deepest core of his heart, there is a light, brighter
Than the sun that shine each day, whether it be
Sunny or gray. A light of truth that stands still in
His heart, as the candle without the fire, that
Desires, a spark. Waiting to explode as a huge
Volcano, or maybe a flick of flint. Truly joy is in
The light that is deep in his heart. If he search
After it, it will grow. If he refuse it, it will
Continue to drift away, as a bottle cast into the
Open sea, or a kite airborne with a broken string.
""Joy, light, all the same within the heart, hidden
Deep as the fossils of the days of old, search"" I say,
As looking for a hidden treasure, while the time of
Life beats as the wave against the rocks on the sea
Shore. Before life is no more, find it quick, joy in the
Light of the heart."
10,Emotion,JoyPoemsADailyJoyToBeAlivePoembyJimmySantiagoBaca,"No matter how serene things
may be in my life,
how well things are going,
my body and soul
are two cliff peaks
from which a dream of who I can be
falls, and I must learn
to fly again each day,
or die.
Death draws respect
and fear from the living.
Death offers
no false starts. It is not
a referee with a pop-gun
at the startling
of a hundred yard dash.
I do not live to retrieve
or multiply what my father lost
or gained.
I continually find myself in the ruins
of new beginnings,
uncoiling the rope of my life
to descend ever deeper into unknown abysses,
tying my heart into a knot
round a tree or boulder,
to insure I have something that will hold me,
that will not let me fall.
My heart has many thorn-studded slits of flame
springing from the red candle jars.
My dreams flicker and twist
on the altar of this earth,
light wrestling with darkness,
light radiating into darkness,
to widen my day blue,
and all that is wax melts
in the flame-
I can see treetops!"
11,Emotion,JoyPoemsTheJoyOfCookingPoembyKathleenWest,"One of the things that I'm most proud of
Since I was very young
Is learning to cook and enjoying it so
And what a pleasure it has become
It started with egg sandwiches for Dad
He liked one when he wanted a snack
He said mine were the best that could be had
I was proud to do something back
Then there was the apples pies I baked
One day when mom was out
And to my joy, the crust turned out great!
And my love of cooking came about
Mom taught me to season everything just right
And all the tips she knew
The soups and gravies, and cakes so lite
The cassaroles and the irish stew
Then I was making dinner for the family
My four brothers, mom and dad, and me
And at fourteen years old I was hired to cook
For the neighbor with seven kids to feed!
Later when I got a place on my own
I couldn't afford to go out to eat
I could barely afford to pay the rent!
I was broke, but I ate like a queen!
I've fed all my family and friends that I know
And catered parties and festivals too
And the joy that I feel can't help but show
I love to nurture people with food!
We must all nourish our bodies each day
So why not make it taste great!
With a little planning, a will, and a way
The skies the limit on what we can make!
The joy of cooking is something learned and shared
And it unites the young and the old
A lifelong love that can only be compared
To a treasure more precious than gold!"
12,Emotion,JoyPoemsJoyHasBegunPoembyErnestineNorthover,"On these undulating hills where sheep roam free,
and every rabbit builds his own colony.
Yellow cowslips, pink clover and purple vetch,
add colour to the green fields as they stretch
as far as the eye can see.  Here’s such a view
to fill the heart with joy that’s long overdue.
The fresh, sweet, clear air that swirls and twirls around,
only in the quiet countryside is found.
And placid cows that will wander munching grass,
take such little notice of us as we pass.
Rooks cawing loudly throughout the hours of day,
seem to send a warning. ‘Don’t you dare to stay’.
This ground so lush with all its fine thriving plants.
Animals, birds and insects, how they all enhance.
Beautiful  treasury set out here to find,
available for each being of mankind.
The pleasure should be welcomed by everyone.
On these undulating hills, joy has begun.

13,Emotion,JoyPoemsTheJoyOfTravelPoembyMarilynLott,"What a thrill it is to travel
Perhaps in a different country
The cultures incredibly diverse
So many wonderful things to see
The clothes can be so different
Unique in their treasured styles
An entirely distinctive kind of people
With their friendly happy smiles
And the food can be quite challenging
Different tastes and how they eat
But, hey, I’m ready to try it
Doesn’t have to be potatoes and meat
Different ways and thoughts of worship
It is such an international treat
To see the different cultures
And all the interesting folks you meet
So if you get a chance, folks
Get on a plane or cruising ship
Take yourself to another country
Have a great and wonderful trip!"
14,Emotion,JoyPoemsMischievousJoyPoembyJohannWolfgangvonGoethe,"AS a butterfly renew'd,
When in life I breath'd my last,
To the spots my flight I wing,
Scenes of heav'nly rapture past,
Over meadows, to the spring,
Round the hill, and through the wood.
Soon a tender pair I spy,
And I look down from my seat
On the beauteous maiden's head--
When embodied there I meet
All I lost as soon as dead,
Happy as before am I.
Him she clasps with silent smile,
And his mouth the hour improves,
Sent by kindly Deities;
First from breast to mouth it roves,
Then from mouth to hands it flies,
And I round him sport the while.
And she sees me hov'ring near;
Trembling at her lovers rapture,
Up she springs--I fly away,
""Dearest! let's the insect capture
Come! I long to make my prey
Yonder pretty little dear!"""
15,Emotion,JoyPoemsHymnOfJoyPoembyHenryVanDyke,"To the music of Beethoven's ninth symphony
Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee,
God of glory, Lord of love;
Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee,
Praising Thee their sun above.
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness;
Drive the dark of doubt away;
Giver of immortal gladness,
Fill us with the light of day!
All Thy works with joy surround Thee,
Earth and heaven reflect Thy rays,
Stars and angels sing around Thee,
Centre of unbroken praise:
Field and forest, vale and mountain,
Blooming meadow, flashing sea,
Chanting bird and flowing fountain,
Call us to rejoice in Thee.
Thou art giving and forgiving,
Ever blessing, ever blest,
Well-spring of the joy of living,
Ocean-depth of happy rest!
Thou our Father, Christ our Brother, --
All who live in love are Thine:
Teach us how to love each other,
Lift us to the Joy Divine.
Mortals join the mighty chorus,
Which the morning stars began;
Father-love is reigning o'er us,
Brother-love binds man to man.
Ever singing march we onward,
Victors in the midst of strife;
Joyful music lifts us sunward
In the triumph song of life."
16,Emotion,JoyPoemsTheJoyOfBeingPoembySandraFowler,"Beyond the glass snowfall is luminous.
Winter burns like a lamp upon the sill.
The old house creaks in deference to the wind.
Kind eyes affirm that cold cannot come in.
Time for the robins? If you say so, Friend.
Praise for the woodfires that have warmed our past.
Red firelight paints the ceiling with itself.
The joy of our mere being is alive.
We do not yet concede the mood to spring,
The scent of lilacs and the young, green trees.
For us bare branches are articulate,
They tell us all we ever need to know.

17,Emotion,JoyPoemsAChildBringsJoyPoembyTheresaAnnMoore,"All the time in the world
Can never be as precious
As the years your child grows
It is a luxury of the ambitious
Although minutes are impounded
With things that must be done
Chores and working for a dollar
Should not eliminate the fun
Children are a marvel to observe
Each moment becomes more satisfying
Even when the days are challenging
Rewards of success are gratifying
When the hours of budding have dissolved
An adult emerges and comprehends
With joy and laughter, remembering when…
The moments continue to give dividends

Resounding strangely, sadly,
These peaceful plains along.

Great King of Kings, we fall!
Least of the host which adore Thee,

In thy holy sight,
We are guilty, we are guilty --
We have all gone astray;

19,Emotion,JoyPoemsSonnetTheGreatestJoyOnEarthIsChildrenPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"The greatest joy on earth is our children;
To see them born healthy and grow up well;
To see them acquire God's precious ken,
That guides them to Heaven, avoiding hell.
What joy it is to see them walk on fours!
And learn to move, to utter sounds with sense;
What joy it is to hear their mental stores!
To see them worldly-wise, avoid non-sense.
What, joy to see the child, Father of man!
What joy to see them outdo their parents!
What joy when things we cannot do, they can!
What joy to see their God-given talents?
Our children are the apples of our eyes;
The Almighty God, we see, in their guise."
20,Emotion,JoyPoemsOneForSorrowTwoForJoyPoembyHughMitchell,"Good morning Mr Magpie
alone again, like me
I greet you then I bless myself
and hope that I shall see
your lady busy in the trees
up here in Jagger Green.
The wind is soft and urgent
on the pale green Yorkshire hills
rooks fuss in high bare branches
looking down on silent mills
and the magpie is a single bird
up here in Jagger Green.
I watched him as he rested
in the Mayday morning light
then hard and low and straight there came
another flash of black and white
and the sun is like a woman's kiss
up here in Jagger Green."
21,Emotion,JoyPoemsJoyPoembyJohannWolfgangvonGoethe,"A DRAGON-FLY with beauteous wing
Is hov'ring o'er a silv'ry spring;
I watch its motions with delight,--
Now dark its colours seem, now bright;
Chameleon-like appear, now blue,
Now red, and now of greenish hue.
Would it would come still nearer me,
That I its tints might better see
It hovers, flutters, resting ne'er!
But hush! it settles on the mead.
I have it safe now, I declare!
And when its form I closely view,
'Tis of a sad and dingy blue--
Such, Joy-Dissector, is thy case indeed"

Rows of liquid eyes in laughter,
How they glimmer, how they quiver!
Sparkling one another after,
Like bright ripples on a river.
Tipsy band of rubious faces,
Flushed with joy's etheral spirit,
Make your mocks and sly grimaces
At Love's self, and do not fear it!"
24,Emotion,JoyPoemsMayInternetConnectionsBringYouMoreJoyPoembyMargaretAlice,"I wanted to say hello to some cyber-friends,
poets and commenters who stopped by to
send an encouraging word; wonderful
people who refrain from criticism as they
know how it hurts – yet never hold back
their praise when their hearts are touched
But Internet connection is so bad -
it refuses to allow me to reply tonight,
when I read a poem and click to comment,
the computer coldly informs me that it
cannot (will not? refuses to? !)   open
that site, forget your request
I’m doing my best to stay calm -
but I’ve lost it – I feel like killing the
bloody machine! - so to one and all;
please forgive if I don’t mention your
name; the bloody machine takes too long
I can’t look again – and the old memory
is clogged by thoughts murderous and angry –
Elmer and Goldy Locks; Tara, Patti, Sue, Max Reif,
Chris, Zen, Theo and Marci Made – and all whose
names I could not look up before losing my mind;
thank you for saying hello; I’m fine tonight - though
I hate my PC and the Internet - and now am
Convinced it hates me – I’ve decided you are
all figments of my imagination; as unreachable
as Mount Everest, but as wonderful as the best
dream; your presence became a vision to me –
thank you all for entering my dreams and being
part of an imaginary scheme of cyber-entities
Though the evil bewitched machine won’t allow
me to link with you; though I have to withdraw
from the world and live within myself; though
at work there is no time to forge bonds, I am
deliciously delighted by your poetry and your
PoemHunter presence; Monday I’ll try again
To steal some time to link up - until then;
all the best, enjoy your rest, may the weekend
be fun, may you have adventures and challenges
enough to keep you happy and fighting fit; may
your PC’s and Internet connections bring you more
joy - than mine has bloody well done!"
25,Emotion,JoyPoemsJaloppyJoyPoembyRobertWilliamService,"Past ash cans and alley cats,
Fetid. overflowing gutters,
Leprous lines of rancid flats
Where the frowsy linen flutters;
With a rattle and a jar,
hark! I sing a happy ditty,
As I speed my Master far
From the poison of the City.
Speed him to the sportive sea,
Watch him walloping the briny,
Light his pipe and brew his tea
In a little wood that's piny;
Haven him to peace of mind.
Drowsy dreams in pleasant places,
Where the woman's eyes are kind,
And the men have ruddy faces.
Just a jaloppy am I,
But he's always been my lover,
So each Sunday morn I try
Youthful joy to re-discover.
For he loves the wild and free,
And though he would never know it,
Nature thrills him with the glee
And the rapture of the poet.
He's a little invoice clerk,
I'm a worn and ancient flivver;
I have an asthmatic spark,
He an alcoholic liver;
Yet with clatter, clang and creak
We are lyrical for one day;
Then another loathly week,
Living for another Sunday."
26,Emotion,JoyPoemsMySecretJoyPoembySusanCasey,"If it were not for you
It seems that every day would be
A life unfulfilled.
Winter then forever and no smile of spring.
An icy lake without a melted heart within.
You are my secret joy.
When first I saw your face
A satisfaction took the place of sad distraction.
I knew my mind had been in a phase of leaving,
You drew me back a pace, with you I saw commitment,
This time there could be no dreaming,
No time for grieving what was past.
My secret joy was here with me.
So many times, I saw her face in your face.
That special wisdom of her eyes in your eyes,
I knew a child I thought was gone for always
Had brought joy home.
I watch you watch the joy you have made
Wonder if you know the joy that you gave
Would like you to know that the joy that you made
Is my joy too.
However long before the joy that you made.
That little blue the two of you gave.
I had a little joy of my own.
Even though the joy that I made,
Has gone the road that life takes.
Singing love songs to the joys of her own,
I see reflections of the Joy that I made,
In the eyes and the heart of the Joy, she has made.
I can see pink joy reflected in blue joy,
When I see it.
My secret joy."

She needs help she pleads
And I answer
Where and when
I do not bother
About why
I could be unethical
For my left hand
Must learn to give
Without my right
Hand knowing
And Hope comes next
Waiting at the Capitol
What a coincidence
She likes a hitch ride too
She needs help
Her heart is broken
And need immediate repair
I have this flashy car
With space enough for two
Or more
How can a man
Sane still
Refuse to give the best
Ride for lovely lonely women
Like them?
To err is human
But to make love is divine
And so I’ll go
What happens next
I will not tell you
Wait! My cell phone is ringing
It is Charity again calling!"

To flow like an inspiring art
In the moment of fresh sunlight,
Given succour so sweet and bright.
Of what manner does your joy bring?
Flowing so that my heart did sing
Of the wind that came with splendour,
Wondrous in it to add colour.
Water, my heart is made calm as a dove
By your joy that comforts with love.
How it places my heart so good
That it does it with brightened mood.
Yet my heart truly shines with beams,
Dressed with pleasures more than sweet dreams.
Your water made it to feel higher
With life of so much deep desire.
Water, with vigour your joy heals
My heart so nicely that it feels.
So great that my heart now smiles deep
With warm rays of the sun to keep."
29,Emotion,JoyPoemsStanzasForMusicTheresNotAJoyTheWorldCanGivePoembyGeorgeGordonByron,"There's not a joy the world can give like that it takes away
When the glow of early thought declines in feeling's dull decay;
'Tis not on youth's smooth cheek the blush alone, which fades so fast,
But the tender bloom of heart is gone, ere youth itself be past.
Then the few whose spirits float above the wreck of happiness
Are driven o'er the shoals of guilt, or ocean of excess:
The magnet of their course is gone, or only points in vain
The shore to which their shivered sail shall never stretch again.
Then the mortal coldness of the soul like death itself comes down;
It cannot feel for others' woes, it dare not dream its own;
That heavy chill has frozen o'er the fountain of our tears,
And though the eye may sparkle still, 'tis where the ice appears.
Though wit may flash from fluent lips, and mirth distract the breast,
Through midnight hours that yield no more their former hope of rest,
'Tis but as ivy-leaves around the ruined turret wreath—
All green and wildly fresh without, but worn and grey beneath.
Oh, could I feel as I have felt, or be what I have been,
Or weep as I could once have wept, o'er many a vanished scene;
As springs in deserts found seem sweet, all brackish though they be,
So, midst the withered waste of life, those tears would flow to me."
30,Emotion,JoyPoemsPersuasionsToJoyASongPoembyThomasCarew,"IF the quick spirits in your eye
Now languish and anon must die;
If every sweet and every grace
Must fly from that forsaken face;
Then, Celia, let us reap our joys
Ere Time such goodly fruit destroys.
Or if that golden fleece must grow
For ever free from aged snow;
If those bright suns must know no shade,
Nor your fresh beauties ever fade;
Then fear not, Celia, to bestow
What, still being gather'd, still must grow.
Thus either Time his sickle brings
In vain, or else in vain his wings."
31,Emotion,JoyPoemsSadnessAndJoyPoembyWilliamHenryDavies,"I pray you, Sadness, leave me soon,
In sweet invention thou art poor!
Thy sister, Joy can make ten songs
While thou art making four.
One hour with thee is sweet enough;
But when we find the whole day gone
And no created thing is left --
We mourn the evil done.
Thou art too slow to shape thy thoughts
In stone, on canvas, or in song;
But Joy, being full of active heat,
Must do some deed ere long.
Thy sighs are gentle, sweet thy tears;
But if thou canst not help a man
To prove in substance what he feels --
Then givve me Joy, who can.
Therefore sweet Sadness, leave me soon,
Let thy bright sister, Joy, come more;
For she can make ten lovely songs
While thou art making four."

'Tis so much joy! 'Tis so much joy!
If I should fail, what poverty!
And yet, as poor as I,
Have ventured all upon a throw!
Have gained! Yes! Hesitated so—
This side the Victory!
Life is but Life! And Death, but Death!
Bliss is, but Bliss, and Breath but Breath!
And if indeed I fail,
At least, to know the worst, is sweet!
Defeat means nothing but Defeat,
No drearier, can befall!
And if I gain! Oh Gun at Sea!
Oh Bells, that in the Steeples be!
At first, repeat it slow!
For Heaven is a different thing,
Conjectured, and waked sudden in—
And might extinguish me!"
33,Emotion,JoyPoemsJoyToHaveMeritedThePainPoembyEmilyDickinson,"788
Joy to have merited the Pain—
To merit the Release—
Joy to have perished every step—
To Compass Paradise—
Pardon—to look upon thy face—
With these old fashioned Eyes—
Better than new—could be—for that—
Though bought in Paradise—
Because they looked on thee before—
And thou hast looked on them—
Prove Me—My Hazel Witnesses
The features are the same—
So fleet thou wert, when present—
So infinite—when gone—
An Orient's Apparition—
Remanded of the Morn—
The Height I recollect—
'Twas even with the Hills—
The Depth upon my Soul was notched—
As Floods—on Whites of Wheels—
To Haunt—till Time have dropped
His last Decade away,
And Haunting actualize—to last
At least—Eternity—"
34,Emotion,JoyPoemsTheJoyYouBringPoembyLouiseTredoux,"Read this morning people write
the end of their story right from
the beginning of their life and all
through the way, look what people
are doing and how they treat
others to get a hint of the end
I fell into a reverie thinking of the
beginning of you and me, how you
noticed my problems and helped me
up when I fell, how you treated other
people and how your joie die vivre
increased with the years
I feel sure there is a beautiful ending
for us, I know that your lips are more
eager to smile and kiss than ever be-
fore, your arms are stronger, your tread
more steadfast, I can tell you are writing
an enchanting tale for us
I can’t get enough of the joy you bring
into my life, I jumped up and sent you
an SMS just to say I love you so much…"
35,Emotion,JoyPoemsYourJoyIsMyJoyPoembyEdwardKofiLouis,"Your joy is my joy!
And, your laughter heals my soul.
The city of songs,
The smile on your face heals my heart;
The city of music!
Your laughter is like medicine to my heart;
Friendship should have rules and,
Everybody should obey them.
The future is with the influence of your life today,
So, you can change your life for the better is you want to;
Loon, loom!
True-love is with the wonder formula of life;
Your joy is my joy and,
Your laughter heals my soul."
36,Emotion,JoyPoemsAJoyRideOnMobikePoembyMamtaAgarwal,"Arms around your waist,
And hairflying in the air,
That first joyride on mobike
On Delhi roads sealed our fate.
A lot can happen over coffee,
The best in town you will find,
As we walked hand in hand
Through a plush hotel lobby.
As we sat, you said say yes now,
What, we have just met, I protest.
I know for sure, it’s destined
Please just don’t ask me how.
Love at first sight,
I laughed out loud,
Happens in Mills and Boon,
As we slipped out at night.
I said yes the very next day
Still fills me with disbelief.
Like a hero of romantic movies
You were charming in so many ways.
Now the mobike is gone,
And we travel side by side,
In a luxury air conditioned car.
To  town, to work every morn.
In silence we drive, preoccupied
Hands on lap, hair in place,  I see
A couple on a speeding bike,
And think of that first joyride…"
37,Emotion,JoyPoemsHymnToJoyPoembyFriedrichSchiller,"Joy, thou goddess, fair, immortal,
Offspring of Elysium,
Mad with rapture, to the portal
Of thy holy fame we come!
Fashion's laws, indeed, may sever,
But thy magic joins again;
All mankind are brethren ever
'Neath thy mild and gentle reign.
CHORUS.
Welcome, all ye myriad creatures!
Brethren, take the kiss of love!
Yes, the starry realms above
Hide a Father's smiling features!
He, that noble prize possessing--
He that boasts a friend that's true,
He whom woman's love is blessing,
Let him join the chorus too!
Aye, and he who but one spirit
On this earth can call his own!
He who no such bliss can merit,
Let him mourn his fate alone!
CHORUS.
All who Nature's tribes are swelling
Homage pay to sympathy;
For she guides us up on high,
Where the unknown has his dwelling.
From the breasts of kindly Nature
All of joy imbibe the dew;
Good and bad alike, each creature
Would her roseate path pursue.
'Tis through her the wine-cup maddens,
Love and friends to man she gives!
Bliss the meanest reptile gladdens,--
Near God's throne the cherub lives!
CHORUS.
Bow before him, all creation!
Mortals, own the God of love!
Seek him high the stars above,--
Yonder is his habitation!
Joy, in Nature's wide dominion,
Mightiest cause of all is found;
And 'tis joy that moves the pinion,
When the wheel of time goes round;
From the bud she lures the flower--
Suns from out their orbs of light;
Distant spheres obey her power,
Far beyond all mortal sight.
CHORUS.
As through heaven's expanse so glorious
In their orbits suns roll on,
Brethren, thus your proud race run,
Glad as warriors all-victorious!
Joy from truth's own glass of fire
Sweetly on the searcher smiles;
Lest on virtue's steeps he tire,
Joy the tedious path beguiles.
High on faith's bright hill before us,
See her banner proudly wave!
Joy, too, swells the angels' chorus,--
Bursts the bondage of the grave!
CHORUS.
Mortals, meekly wait for heaven
Suffer on in patient love!
In the starry realms above,
Bright rewards by God are given.
To the Gods we ne'er can render
Praise for every good they grant;
Let us, with devotion tender,
Minister to grief and want.
Quenched be hate and wrath forever,
Pardoned be our mortal foe--
May our tears upbraid him never,
No repentance bring him low!
CHORUS.
Sense of wrongs forget to treasure--
Brethren, live in perfect love!
In the starry realms above,
God will mete as we may measure.
Joy within the goblet flushes,
For the golden nectar, wine,
Every fierce emotion hushes,--
Fills the breast with fire divine.
Brethren, thus in rapture meeting,
Send ye round the brimming cup,--
Yonder kindly spirit greeting,
While the foam to heaven mounts up!
CHORUS.
He whom seraphs worship ever;
Whom the stars praise as they roll,
Yes to him now drain the bowl
Mortal eye can see him never!
Courage, ne'er by sorrow broken!
Aid where tears of virtue flow;
Faith to keep each promise spoken!
Truth alike to friend and foe!
'Neath kings' frowns a manly spirit!--
Brethren, noble is the prize--
Honor due to every merit!
Death to all the brood of lies!
CHORUS.
Draw the sacred circle closer!
By this bright wine plight your troth
To be faithful to your oath!
Swear it by the Star-Disposer!
Safety from the tyrant's power!
Mercy e'en to traitors base!
Hope in death's last solemn hour!
Pardon when before His face!
Lo, the dead shall rise to heaven!
Brethren hail the blest decree;
Every sin shall be forgiven,
Hell forever cease to be!
CHORUS.
When the golden bowl is broken,
Gentle sleep within the tomb!
Brethren, may a gracious doom
By the Judge of man be spoken!"
38,Emotion,JoyPoemsJoyPoembyEllaWheelerWilcox,"My heart is like a little bird
That sits and sings for very gladness.
Sorrow is some forgotten word,
And so, except in rhyme, is sadness.
The world is very fair to me –
Such azure skies, such golden weather,
I’m like a long caged bird set free,
My heart is lighter than a feather.
I rise rejoicing in my life;
I live with love of God and neighbour;
My days flow on unmarred by strife,
And sweetened by my pleasant labour.
O youth! O spring! O happy days,
Ye are so passing sweet, and tender,
And while the fleeting season stays,
I revel care-free, in its splendour."
39,Emotion,JoyPoemsMorningJoyPoembyClaudeMcKay,"At night the wide and level stretch of wold,
Which at high noon had basked in quiet gold,
Far as the eye could see was ghostly white;
Dark was the night save for the snow's weird light.
I drew the shades far down, crept into bed;
Hearing the cold wind moaning overhead
Through the sad pines, my soul, catching its pain,
Went sorrowing with it across the plain.
At dawn, behold! the pall of night was gone,
Save where a few shrubs melancholy, lone,
Detained a fragile shadow. Golden-lipped
The laughing grasses heaven's sweet wine sipped.
The sun rose smiling o'er the river's breast,
And my soul, by his happy spirit blest,
Soared like a bird to greet him in the sky,
And drew out of his heart Eternity."
40,Emotion,JoyPoemsJoyAndPeacePoembyaryaindiaindia,"There's peace and joy in knowing
That love and truth so reign
That joy and peace in sowing

In reaping sown harvested joys
Great hearts are far from hollow"
41,Emotion,JoyPoemsTheJoyOfLittleThingsPoembyRobertWilliamService,"It's good the great green earth to roam,
Where sights of awe the soul inspire;
But oh, it's best, the coming home,
The crackle of one's own hearth-fire!
You've hob-nobbed with the solemn Past;
You've seen the pageantry of kings;
Yet oh, how sweet to gain at last
The peace and rest of Little Things!
Perhaps you're counted with the Great;
You strain and strive with mighty men;
Your hand is on the helm of State;
Colossus-like you stride . . . and then
There comes a pause, a shining hour,
A dog that leaps, a hand that clings:
O Titan, turn from pomp and power;
Give all your heart to Little Things.
Go couch you childwise in the grass,
Believing it's some jungle strange,
Where mighty monsters peer and pass,
Where beetles roam and spiders range.
'Mid gloom and gleam of leaf and blade,
What dragons rasp their painted wings!
O magic world of shine and shade!
O beauty land of Little Things!
I sometimes wonder, after all,
Amid this tangled web of fate,
If what is great may not be small,
And what is small may not be great.
So wondering I go my way,
Yet in my heart contentment sings . . .
O may I ever see, I pray,
God's grace and love in Little Things.
So give to me, I only beg,
A little roof to call my own,
A little cider in the keg,
A little meat upon the bone;
A little garden by the sea,
A little boat that dips and swings . . .
Take wealth, take fame, but leave to me,
O Lord of Life, just Little Things."
42,Emotion,JoyPoemsThreeSecondsBetweenJoyOrPainPoembyTimothyWeiermann,"My heart is racing
My nerves breaking
Tension’s heavy in the air
Euphoria’s waking
My body shaking
Tensed for a scare
Numbing joy
Or shattering pain
One is inevitable,
Like the coming rain
Three seconds
Free of both pain and joy
Three seconds to wait
Feeling like the smallest boy"
43,Emotion,JoyPoemsSongsOfJoyPoembyWilliamHenryDavies,"Sing out, my soul, thy songs of joy;
Sing as a happy bird will sing
Beneath a rainbow's lovely arch
In the spring.
Think not of death in thy young days;
Why shouldst thou that grim tyrant fear?
And fear him not when thou art old,
And he is near.
Strive not for gold, for greedy fools
Measure themselves by poor men never;
Their standard still being richer men,
Makes them poor ever.
Train up thy mind to feel content,
What matters then how low thy store?
What we enjoy, and not possess,
Makes rich or poor.
Filled with sweet thought, then happy I
Take not my state from other's eyes;
What's in my mind -- not on my flesh
Or theirs -- I prize.
Sing, happy soul, thy songs of joy;
Such as a Brook sings in the wood,
That all night has been strengthened by
Heaven's purer flood."

Reach out your hands
And take it when it runs by,
As the Apache dancer
Clutches his woman.
I have seen them
Live long and laugh loud,
Sent on singing, singing,
Smashed to the heart
Under the ribs
With a terrible love.
Joy always,
Joy everywhere--
Let joy kill you!
Keep away from the little deaths."
46,Emotion,JoyPoemsJoyBellsPoembySiegfriedSassoon,"Ring your sweet bells; but let them be farewells
To the green-vista’d gladness of the past
That changed us into soldiers; swing your bells
To a joyful chime; but let it be the last.
What means this metal in windy belfries hung
When guns are all our need? Dissolve these bells
Whose tones are tuned for peace: with martial tongue
Let them cry doom and storm the sun with shells.
Bells are like fierce-browed prelates who proclaim
That ‘if our Lord returned He’d fight for us.’
So let our bells and bishops do the same,
Shoulder to shoulder with the motor-bus."
47,Emotion,JoyPoemsSongOfJoyPoembyGöranGustafsson,"Tune up your strings in harmony
Strike up your song of joy
And learn the music, let it sound
Stand up and sing your song
When birds begin to sing their song
You know the night has gone
When all the shadows have withdrawn
You know the day has dawned
And then be pleased, you living one
To see the morning sun
Be pleased to see the newborn smile
And know that life worthwhile
Be pleased to feel the morning dew
And life being born anew
Be pleased to touch your lover's heart
And know you'll never part
Be pleased to hear all nature sings
A hymn to you it brings
With notes and chords of sacred vow
To be the eternal Now
Tune up your strings in harmony
Strike up your song of joy
And learn the music, let it sound
Stand up and sing your song

48,Emotion,JoyPoemsPeacockStory9JoyOfJoysPoembyAlisonCassidy,"They call her Milly
next door,
but we think Milly
is rather silly.
She’ll always be
Miss P to us.
They knocked
round lunchtime yesterday
excited
‘Milly’s back
and guess what? ’
We crept up the path
(tinder dry after summer heat)
and spied her
wandering casually
and maternally
among the dead azaleas
with three young chicks
in tow -
Joy of joys!
(we thought she'd flown) .
We watched
enchanted
as they wolfed
the crumbs of bread -
hungry it would seem
and completely at peace
with their world.
We spoke about
‘last year’
and the lone chick
who lingered… not long enough.
And shared a prayer
that the cats,
the kookaburras
and the currawongs
might leave them alone this time."

50,Emotion,JoyPoemsWorkAndJoyPoembyRobertWilliamService,"Each day I live I thank the Lord
I do the work I love;
And in it find a rich reward,
All price and praise above.
For few may do the work they love,
The fond unique employ,
That fits them as a hand a glove,
And gives them joy.
Oh gentlefolk, do you and you
Who toil for daily hire,
Consider that the job you do
Is to your heart's desire?
Aye, though you are to it resigned,
And will no duty shirk,
Oh do you in your private mind
Adore your work?
Twice happy man whose job is joy,
Whose hand and heart combine,
In brave and excellent employ
As radiantly as mine!
But oh the weary, dreary day,
The wear and tear and irk
Of countless souls who cannot say:
'I love my work.'"

With all the beautiful corals and fishes

Collecting sea shells, big and small
In my small room i have it all
Consider it a  blessing
My entire life, i give thanks.and oh... i wanted to sing
Come and  see my favorite things
When the sky is blue, and i am feeling low
I  go back to see this place i know
And spend my whole life through

and my cousins fondly called me, 'Meggie the mermaid' he he.

52,Emotion,JoyPoemsTheDeathOfJoyGardnerPoembyBenjaminZephaniah,"They put a leather belt around her
13 feet of tape and bound her
Handcuffs to secure her
And only God knows what else,
She's illegal, so deport her
Said the Empire that brought her
She died,
Nobody killed her
And she never killed herself.
It is our job to make her
Return to Jamaica
Said the Alien Deporters
Who deports people like me,
It was said she had a warning
That the officers were calling
On that deadly July morning
As her young son watched TV.
An officer unplugged the phone
Mother and child were now alone
When all they wanted was a home
A child watch Mummy die,
No matter what the law may say
A mother should not die this way
Let human rights come into play
And to everyone apply.
I know not of a perfect race
I know not of a perfect place
I know this is not a simple case
Of Yardies on the move,
We must talk some Race Relations
With the folks from immigration
About this kind of deportation
If things are to improve.
Let it go down in history
The word is that officially
She died democratically
In 13 feet of tape,
That Christian was over here
Because pirates were over there
The Bible sent us everywhere
To make Great Britain great.
Here lies the extradition squad
And we should all now pray to God
That as they go about their job
They make not one mistake,
For I fear as I walk the streets
That one day I just may meet
Officials who may tie my feet
And how would I escape.
I see my people demonstrating
And educated folks debating
The way they're separating
The elder from the youth,
When all they are demanding
Is a little overstanding
They too have family planning
Now their children want the truth.
As I move around I am eyeing
So many poets crying
And so many poets trying
To articulate the grief,
I cannot help but wonder
How the alien deporters
(As they said to press reporters)
Can feel absolute relief."

56,Emotion,JoyPoemsJoyAndPeaceInBelievingPoembyWilliamCowper,"Sometimes a light surprises
The Christian while he sings;
It is the Lord who rises
With healing on His wings;
When comforts are declining,
He grants the soul again
A season of clear shining,
To cheer it after rain.
In holy contemplation
We sweetly then pursue
The theme of God's salvation,
And find it ever new;
Set free from present sorrow,
We cheerfully can say,
E'en let the unknown to-morrow
Bring with it what it may!
It can bring with it nothing,
But He will bear us through;
Who gives the lilies clothing,
Will clothe His people too;
Beneath the spreading heavens
No creature but is fed;
And He who feeds the ravens
Will give His children bread.
Though vine nor fig tree neither
Their wonted fruit shall bear,
Though all the field should wither,
Nor flocks nor herds be there:
Yet God the same abiding,
His praise shall tune my voice;
For, while in Him confiding,
I cannot but rejoice."
57,Emotion,JoyPoemsMyDearestFrankIWishYouJoyPoembyJaneAusten,"My dearest Frank, I wish you joy
Of Mary's safety with a Boy,
Whose birth has given little pain
Compared with that of Mary Jane.--
May he a growing Blessing prove,
And well deserve his Parents' Love!--
Endow'd with Art's and Nature's Good,
Thy Name possessing with thy Blood,
In him, in all his ways, may we
Another Francis WIlliam see!--
Thy infant days may he inherit,
THey warmth, nay insolence of spirit;--
We would not with one foult dispense
To weaken the resemblance.
May he revive thy Nursery sin,
Peeping as daringly within,
His curley Locks but just descried,
With 'Bet, my be not come to bide.'--
Fearless of danger, braving pain,
And threaten'd very oft in vain,
Still may one Terror daunt his Soul,
One needful engine of Controul
Be found in this sublime array,
A neigbouring Donkey's aweful Bray.
So may his equal faults as Child,
Produce Maturity as mild!
His saucy words and fiery ways
In early Childhood's pettish days,
In Manhood, shew his Father's mind
Like him, considerate and Kind;
All Gentleness to those around,
And anger only not to wound.
Then like his Father too, he must,
To his own former struggles just,
Feel his Deserts with honest Glow,
And all his self-improvement know.
A native fault may thus give birth
To the best blessing, conscious Worth.
As for ourselves we're very well;
As unaffected prose will tell.--
Cassandra's pen will paint our state,
The many comforts that await
Our Chawton home, how much we find
Already in it, to our mind;
And how convinced, that when complete
It will all other Houses beat
The ever have been made or mended,
With rooms concise, or rooms distended.
You'll find us very snug next year,
Perhaps with Charles and Fanny near,
For now it often does delight us
To fancy them just over-right us.--"
58,Emotion,JoyPoemsJoyOfFishingPoembyMarilynLott,"Oh how I enjoyed so very much
Fishing off a bridge
Or perhaps ‘long side the road
Or from up on a slight ridge
I remember many years ago
On the first day of the season
Going out before daylight
Getting my limit was the reason
Cold when I would paddle out
In a small and rented boat
And if I caught lots of fish
Oh, how I loved to gloat
But it was fun, I remember
As I tossed the long line out
And when I’d feel that tug
I’d wait to give a mighty shout
Until that little fish was on
And I’d nailed him on the spot
It was so much fun, my friend
Especially if he really fought
By the afternoon it was hot
So a cold drink I’d be wishing
And ready to go out again
For the ultimate joy of fishing!"

Stand proud, stand tall,

At day’s end, tending my garden
Dressed in mud
Kissed by the sun
It’s a joy singing old tunes
Alone, in a crowd
Loosing the key midway
Pulling it off anyways
It’s a joy dancing naked
Before my most feared critic
Peaking at myself in a
Horror-struck vanity mirror
It’s a joy being silent
When all else profound
A frog, yellow bellied
Dozing off on a lotus leaf
It’s a joy being loud
When the world dumbfounds
A crow rising at dawn
Training its vocal muscle
It’s a joy, letting fingers roam
Whenever they insist on
As I inscribe in earnest
My holy viewpoint
Oh joy!
I can write
When all else
Cease to exist"

Why do I speak of joy, or write of love,
When my heart is the very den of horror,
And in my soul the pains of Hell I prove,
With all his torments and infernal terror?
What should I say? What yet remains to do?
My brain is dry with weeping all too long,
My sighs be spent in uttering my woe,
And I want words wherewith to tell my wrong;
But, still distracted in Love's lunacy,
And, bedlam-like, thus raging in my grief,
Now rail upon her hair, then on her eye,
Now call her Goddess, then I call her thief,
Now I deny her, then I do confess her,
Now do I curse her, then again I bless her."

a huge sun all thorns but so very high in the heavens.
Α Nymph was gathering our cares and hanging them on the trees
a forest of Judas trees.
Cupids and satyrs were singing and playing
and rosy limbs could be glimpsed amid black laurel
the flesh of young children.
We were happy all that morning;
the abyss was a closed well
ο n which the tender foot of a young faun stamped
do γ ο υ remember its laughter: how happy we were!
And then clouds rain and the damp earth;
you stopped laughing when you reclined in the hut,
and opened your large eyes and gazed
on the archangel wielding a fiery sword
'Ι cannot explain it, ' you said, 'Ι cannot explain it, '
Ι find people impossible to understand
however much they may play with colors
they are all black.
GEORGE SEFERIS. Translated by Kimon Friar."
65,Emotion,JoyPoemsJoyAndPleasurePoembyWilliamHenryDavies,"Now, joy is born of parents poor,
And pleasure of our richer kind;
Though pleasure's free, she cannot sing
As sweet a song as joy confined.
Pleasure's a Moth, that sleeps by day
And dances by false glare at night;
But Joy's a Butterfly, that loves
To spread its wings in Nature's light.
Joy's like a Bee that gently sucks
Away on blossoms its sweet hour;
But pleasure's like a greedy Wasp,
That plums and cherries would devour.
Joy's like a Lark that lives alone,
Whose ties are very strong, though few;
But Pleasure like a Cuckoo roams,
Makes much acquaintance, no friends true.
Joy from her heart doth sing at home,
With little care if others hear;
But pleasure then is cold and dumb,
And sings and laughs with strangers near."
66,Emotion,JoyPoemsDanceForJoyPoembyDavidTaylor,"The clouds are a skimming
Over the tops of the trees.
The birds are all chirping
Announcing a dawn symphony.
The world is a turning
In a heaven that’s spinning.
The traffic is moving
In a flow that’s confusing.
And heads are all nodding
In one single motion,
These words that are dancing are free!
And the clouds are a skimming
Over the tops of the trees."
67,Emotion,JoyPoemsWhatJoyPoembyANDREWBLAKEMORE,"What joy has filled my empty heart
For so long starved of love,
My spirit floating through the air
And on the clouds above.
What joy has come to me at last
When all my hope had gone,
For finally my luck has changed
And fortune now has shone.
What joy when all I had was lost
Alone and poor was I,
But now my future seems so clear
Just like the summer sky.
What joy has filled my empty heart
Now it does sing for thee,
The love for which I'd waited long
Shall last eternally."

69,Emotion,JoyPoemsTheJoyOfBeingPoorPoembyRobertWilliamService,"I
Let others sing of gold and gear, the joy of being rich;
But oh, the days when I was poor, a vagrant in a ditch!
When every dawn was like a gem, so radiant and rare,
And I had but a single coat, and not a single care;
When I would feast right royally on bacon, bread and beer,
And dig into a stack of hay and doze like any peer;
When I would wash beside a brook my solitary shirt,
And though it dried upon my back I never took a hurt;
When I went romping down the road contemptuous of care,
And slapped Adventure on the back -- by Gad! we were a pair;
When, though my pockets lacked a coin, and though my coat was old,
The largess of the stars was mine, and all the sunset gold;
When time was only made for fools, and free as air was I,
And hard I hit and hard I lived beneath the open sky;
When all the roads were one to me, and each had its allure . . .
Ye Gods! these were the happy days, the days when I was poor.
II
Or else, again, old pal of mine, do you recall the times
You struggled with your storyettes, I wrestled with my rhymes;
Oh, we were happy, were we not? -- we used to live so ""high""
(A little bit of broken roof between us and the sky);
Upon the forge of art we toiled with hammer and with tongs;
You told me all your rippling yarns, I sang to you my songs.
Our hats were frayed, our jackets patched, our boots were down at heel,
But oh, the happy men were we, although we lacked a meal.
And if I sold a bit of rhyme, or if you placed a tale,
What feasts we had of tenderloins and apple-tarts and ale!
And yet how often we would dine as cheerful as you please,
Beside our little friendly fire on coffee, bread and cheese.
We lived upon the ragged edge, and grub was never sure,
But oh, these were the happy days, the days when we were poor.
III
Alas! old man, we're wealthy now, it's sad beyond a doubt;
We cannot dodge prosperity, success has found us out.
Your eye is very dull and drear, my brow is creased with care,
We realize how hard it is to be a millionaire.
The burden's heavy on our backs -- you're thinking of your rents,
I'm worrying if I'll invest in five or six per cents.
We've limousines, and marble halls, and flunkeys by the score,
We play the part . . . but say, old chap, oh, isn't it a bore?
We work like slaves, we eat too much, we put on evening dress;
We've everything a man can want, I think . . . but happiness.
Come, let us sneak away, old chum; forget that we are rich,
And earn an honest appetite, and scratch an honest itch.
Let's be two jolly garreteers, up seven flights of stairs,
And wear old clothes and just pretend we aren't millionaires;
And wonder how we'll pay the rent, and scribble ream on ream,
And sup on sausages and tea, and laugh and loaf and dream.
And when we're tired of that, my friend, oh, you will come with me;
And we will seek the sunlit roads that lie beside the sea.
We'll know the joy the gipsy knows, the freedom nothing mars,
The golden treasure-gates of dawn, the mintage of the stars.
We'll smoke our pipes and watch the pot, and feed the crackling fire,
And sing like two old jolly boys, and dance to heart's desire;
We'll climb the hill and ford the brook and camp upon the moor . . .
Old chap, let's haste, I'm mad to taste the Joy of Being Poor."
70,Emotion,JoyPoems708JoyOfChristmasPoembyMelvinaGermain,"Christmas, a joyful time of year.
Fun-filled days, lots of holiday cheer.
Children all over the world, year after year,
Wait for this special day in the hopes
of many gifts to open and play.
How soon we forget, the true
meaning of Christmas.
Sweet Jesus was born on this joyous day.
In a manger in Bethlehem oh, so far away.
No pillow for his head.
No blanket for his bed.
A true gift from God, our Father
Let us praise him instead.

71,Emotion,JoyPoemsLostJoyOfBabyStepsPoembyLindaWinchell,"When we were but a babe
taking our first, little wobbly baby steps.
Our parents applauded and beamed with joy
with outreached arms, they stretched.
Then with time we raised our own
and when they stepped out, you praised.
Always there, to bring them up safely
and instilling  them, with standards raised.
In those little blessed first steps
was a joy we've seemed, to have forgotten or lost.
We don't seem to find, or see our blessings
in the baby steps we now walk.
Where is that joy and excitement?
We should all be walking in everyday?
They're just a bigger stride we're taking
but in a baby first step, stepping way.
One step closer to our Father's arms
which are outstretched just for you!
To catch you if you fall from grace
and make things, all the new.
Reminded of your first child's steps
and the ones you are taking now.
Just know that God the Father and Son
are there, supporting your walking now."
72,Emotion,JoyPoemsJoyInJoyPoembyVishalKumar,"God has created everything in twain
Life - Death
Love - Hate
Joy - Pain
And
Now i crave for the other side
Cuz everything has its joy
Joy has its joy
And
Even pain has its joy
But what everyone looks for
Is the joy of joy
But i seek for the pain
The Sweetness in Pain
Pain in Silence
Silence in Loneliness
Loneliness in Joy
Cuz everything has its Joy!
Joy in joy can only be stong
If after the aeons of pain
A ray of mirth shines
So joy is even incomplete without pain, sorrow etc.
And so i plead to God
Fill my soul with bitterness
Fill my life with Pain
And rest of the quest
I will search my self"

I can tread on the grass or the stars,
Now at last I can live!"
74,Emotion,JoyPoems0017AndWhereTheJoyPoembyMichaelShepherd,"This, then, the question
for those whom it may concern –
to find a celebration in oneself
that, as outer is, so inner;
that all truth rests within oneself –
for where else can it be found?
to love oneself – for oneself must be loveable,
or none other could be loved for true;
to know all happiness to be within;
to celebrate all this; the world a constant joy;
to find this celebration in oneself."
75,Emotion,JoyPoemsJoyFlightPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"I have a friend who is a cowboy,
he flies fast jets for Uncle Sam,
persuaded me to come along
'twas a Sunday in September.
Smart uniform, exotic helmet,
strapped in behind a crazy guy.
He handed me a largish bag
that had blue string around the neck.
'Hold on to this, you may not need it',
he said on take-off, up we went,
we reached five g when your whole bod
gets heavy and you cannot wave.
Or speak, or lift your hand or grab
the pilot by the shoulder grimly,
the bag was used then, held by hands
that did belong to other sprits.
I told him how the flight was fun
but others did deserve a chance
so I'd stand back for two, three years
remembering that string-choked bag."
76,Emotion,JoyPoemsTheJoyYouHaveToSharePoembyIshitaMehta,"I love the way you take my hand and
Lead me through the lane,
It's amazing how you make me laugh
So don't fell the pain.
A mother's love is the strongest type and
This you cannot deny,
Thank you for always being my light
You are the perfect guide.
I've never thought about much
'I love you' really means.
You've always found the time to listen
To my highs, lows and in betweens
I'll never really understand how
You have the energy to care,
There is no doubt about it I'll always respect
The joy you have to share."

enlighten my life with

78,Emotion,JoyPoemsWineAndJoyPoembyFyodorSologub,"Wine and joy are completely forgotten,
As well as his armor and sword.
Alone he descends in the rotten
Mysterious dungeon. The door
Is squeaking with long drawn sound
For no one has entered inside.
The dark and the damp reign around.
The window is narrow and high.
His eyes grow accustomed to the gloom and
Through the dust and the web he explores
Some strange marks, emerging and looming
On the floor, on the vaults, on the walls.
He gazes at the marks’ interlacement
At those incomprehensible signs
And tarries for Death to embrace him
To enlighten his soul and eyes."
79,Emotion,JoyPoemsShareTheJoyPoembyJohnJSeto,"The moon whispers a sweet lullaby to an audience
Of starlets in the morning sky
Soft breezes uncover the layer of my happiness
Lazy clouds of grey melt in the sunshine of our love.
Memories of a lost childhood become reality.
We share a special melody that embraces us in a dream.
Your presence warms the coldest days
When I cannot be with you.
It ignites the sacred hearth within my fragile soul
And strengthens my undying devotion to you.
You fill my cup of passion
When I see the twinkle in your eye.
My life is complete.
Come share of my joy."
80,Emotion,JoyPoemsThePangsThatGuardTheGatesOfJoyPoembyChristopherJohnBrennan,"THE PANGS that guard the gates of joy,
the naked sword that will be kist,
how distant seem’d they to the boy,
white flashes in the rosy mist!
Ah, not where tender play was screen’d
in the light heart of leafy mirth
of that obdurate might we ween’d
that shakes the sure repose of earth.
And sudden, ’twixt a sun and sun,
the veil of dreaming is withdrawn:
lo, our disrupt dominion
and mountains solemn in the dawn;
hard paths that chase the dayspring’s white,
and glooms that hold the nether heat:
oh, strange the world upheaved from night,
oh, dread the life before our feet!"
81,Emotion,JoyPoemsTheWondrousJoyOfLovePoembyGREENWOLFE1962,"The  only  things  of  value
Contained  in  God's  array,
Are  found  in  those  few  moments
When  love  is  on  display.
The  precious  little  seconds
When  lovers  realize
The  joy  and  satisfaction
They  see  in  each  ones  eyes.
The  words  that  pass  in  whispers,
That  shiver  down  the  spine,
The  yearning  for  each  other
That  seems  almost  divine.
It's  when  such  moments  linger,
Those  moments  of  romance;
That  all  life  finds  its  value
In  just  one  loving  glance.
We  all  dream  of  such  moments.
Why  then,  are  they  so  rare?
It  seems  we'd  rather  harbor  love,
Than  spread  it  here  and  there.
We've  shed  our  tears  of  sorrow.
What's  left  are  those  of  joy.
A  strategy  of  loving
Is  what  we  should  employ.
Hug  the  ones  you  cherish,
Just  kiss  and  hold  them  tight.
Do  what  you  have  yet  to  do,
But  always  thought  you  might.
Remember,  lifetimes  numbers
Are  found  on  every  crown.
I  wonder  why  you're  waiting,
The  rain  is  pouring  down.
And  if  you  have  nobody,
Don't  make  this  poor  excuse.
Just  ask,  and  you'll  find  someone
Prepared  to  set  love  loose.
All  souls  should  be  companioned.
Two  hearts  should  beat  as  one.
Two  lips  should  feel  the  passion
Of  kisses,  every  one.
Four  eyes  should  see  the  beauty.
Four  hands  should  gently  feel.
And  tears  of  joy,  when  falling;
Is  love,  both  true  and  real.
For  each  of  us,  though  strangers,
Still  seek  love  as  our  goal.
As  God  wished  His  creations
To  join  as  just  one  soul.
However  you  may  find  it,
No  matter  for  how  long,
There  is  no  love  created
By  two  that  can  be  wrong.
So  have  as  your  endeavor,
His  calling  from  above.
The  spread  of  God's  creation.
The  Wondrous  Joy  Of  Love."

83,Emotion,JoyPoemsOneHourToMadnessAndJoyPoembyWaltWhitman,"ONE hour to madness and joy!
O furious! O confine me not!
(What is this that frees me so in storms?
What do my shouts amid lightnings and raging winds mean?)
O to drink the mystic deliria deeper than any other man!
O savage and tender achings!
(I bequeath them to you, my children,
I tell them to you, for reasons, O bridegroom and bride.)
O to be yielded to you, whoever you are, and you to be yielded to me,
in defiance of the world!
O to return to Paradise! O bashful and feminine!                   10
O to draw you to me--to plant on you for the first time the lips of a
determin'd man!
O the puzzle--the thrice-tied knot--the deep and dark pool! O all
untied and illumin'd!
O to speed where there is space enough and air enough at last!
O to be absolv'd from previous ties and conventions--I from mine, and
you from yours!
O to find a new unthought-of nonchalance with the best of nature!
O to have the gag remov'd from one's mouth!
O to have the feeling, to-day or any day, I am sufficient as I am!
O something unprov'd! something in a trance!
O madness amorous! O trembling!
O to escape utterly from others' anchors and holds!                20
To drive free! to love free! to dash reckless and dangerous!
To court destruction with taunts--with invitations!
To ascend--to leap to the heavens of the love indicated to me!
To rise thither with my inebriate Soul!
To be lost, if it must be so!
To feed the remainder of life with one hour of fulness and freedom!
With one brief hour of madness and joy."
84,Emotion,JoyPoemsSurprisedByJoyPoembyWilliamWordsworth,"Surprised By Joy
Surprised by joy — impatient as the Wind
I turned to share the transport--Oh! with whom
But Thee, deep buried in the silent tomb,
That spot which no vicissitude can find?
Love, faithful love, recalled thee to my mind--
But how could I forget thee? Through what power,
Even for the least division of an hour,
Have I been so beguiled as to be blind
To my most grievous loss?--That thought's return
Was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore,
Save one, one only, when I stood forlorn,
Knowing my heart's best treasure was no more;
That neither present time, nor years unborn
Could to my sight that heavenly face restore."
85,Emotion,JoyPoemsJoyAndSorrowPoembyFrancisDuggan,"One can hear the voice of sorrow sobbing, sobbing endlessly
Yet it hides in dark recesses sorrow you can never see
It's a black and brooding creature with a voice that aches of pain
And all of those who have met with it hope not to meet with it again.
Joy is always bright and breezy joy has got a laughing face
And where ever joy is present you will find a happy place
Joy is loved by everybody the scars of grief it can repair
It is such a happy creature joy is welcome everywhere.
There is not one who likes sorrow you will not hear some one say
I've met with sorrow this morning and meeting it has made my day
At the mention of the name of sorrow people pretend not to hear
But joy always bright and happy greets you with a lusty cheer.
Sorrow it is dark and tearful and it hides in a dark and lonely place
But joy is always bright and cheerful and it greets you with a laughing face
And everybody hates old sorrow as it always gives rise to woe
But joy the happiest of the happy the one all people wish to know."

87,Emotion,JoyPoemsJoyAndSorrowChapterViiiPoembyKhalilGibran,"Then a woman said, ""Speak to us of Joy and Sorrow.""
And he answered:
Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.
And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.
And how else can it be?
The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.
Is not the cup that hold your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter's oven?
And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives?
When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.
When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.
Some of you say, ""Joy is greater than sorrow,"" and others say, ""Nay, sorrow is the greater.""
But I say unto you, they are inseparable.
Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.
Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy.
Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced.
When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall."

Soft hugs of kindness
Lips filled with honesty
A heart of loyalty

A voice of romance

One that's very rare
With beauty that matches
Angels in the sky
Her beauty within
Matches yellow roses
Found in paradise
As  beauty within
Wets my cocoon of life
Gladness slaps my face
Knowing the flames of love
Burns in my flower's heart
Gives gratification
Which makes me cry
Many tears of joy

90,Emotion,JoyPoemsALifeWithoutJoyPoembyGREENWOLFE1962,"I  think  I'm  going  to  make  it  through,
It's  been  so  long  you  see;
There's  much  more  life  behind  me  now
Than  out  in  front  of  me.
There  was  a  time,  when  not  so  sure;
I  thought  to  end  it  then.
I  didn't  see  how  one  could  live
Without  much  joy  and  win.
But  I  found  out  you  can  endure
Without  a  special  one.
And  after  all,  it  must  be  said;
Of  fate,  what's  done  is  done.
And  so  I  choose  to  carry  on
With  life  and  burdens  bore.
I  hope  if  I  can  carry  these,
God  may  not  give  me  more.
But  if  He  did,  I  hope  He'd  grant,
My  just  one  simple  plea;
To  end  my  life  with  one  great  love
Who'd  bring  great  joy  to  me.
So  now  I'm  near  the  end  of  life,
My  joyless  days  near  done.
I'd  lie  if  I  would  dare  to  say,
I  never  did  have  fun.
But  what  is  true,  and  that's  the  rub,
Of  life,  don't  you  agree;
Is  love  is  really  what's  required,
For  joy  to  be  set  free?
So  on  it  is  with  what  remains,
I  hope,  not  very  long;
Of  life,  perhaps  to  know  great  love,
If  it  should  come  along.
And  as  I  go  my  separate  way,
I'll  not  begrudge  their  joy;
If  others  feel  what  I  once  felt,
When  I  was  just  a  boy.
Instead  I'll  smile  and  just  recall
The  joy  I  felt  back  then.
And  know  that  I'll  feel  soon  enough
Love's  wondrous  joy  again."

The Christian while he sings;
It is the Lord who rises
With healing in his wings:
When comforts are declining,
He grants the soul again
A season of clear shining,
To cheer it after rain.
In holy contemplation,
We sweetly then pursue
The theme of God's salvation,
And find it ever new:
Set free from present sorrow,
We cheerfully can say,
E'en let th' unknown to-morrow
Bring with it what it may.
It can bring with it nothing
But he will bear us through;
Who gives the lilies clothing,
Will clothe his people too:
Beneath the spreading heavens,
No creature but is fed;
And he who feeds the ravens,
Will give his children bread.
Though vine nor fig-tree neither
Their wonted fruit shall bear,
Though all the field should wither,
Nor flocks nor herds be there:
Yet God the same abiding,
His praise shall tune my voice;
For while in him confiding,
I cannot but rejoice."

Faithless as the winds or seas;
Sometimes coming, sometimes coy,
Yet she never fails to please;
If with a frown
I am cast down,
Phyllis smiling,
And beguiling,
Makes me happier than before.
Though, alas! too late I find
Nothing can her fancy fix,
Yet the moment she is kind
I forgive her all her tricks;
Which, though I see,
I can't get free;
She deceiving,
I believing;
What need lovers wish for more?"

Sharing and caring
Begotten not made

Abounding love
Free at last, to be
A child of God above
Love is here, and more
To have and to hold
Joy in mothers eyes
Tender security
In fathers sighs
Contentment revealed
In a moment of Joy
Captured in the heart
Of ever girl and boy
Can Joy be captured
I wonder if it can
Joy a transforming miracle
In the eyes of Sam and Dan
The heart of joy in wonder
In whispered smile above
Love is here, and more
Treasure the joy of Love."

98,Emotion,JoyPoemsJoyInMemoriamPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"She gave to all,
with caring hands
and warmth of heart.
They called her,
with a hint of praise
'our volunteer'.
Her man of fifty years
thought of himself
as flabbergast,
the very thought
of clubs and charities,
their numbers endless
like the grains of sand,
on beaches reeking strangely
of the musk of sweet infinity.
She had not needed much
in culinary goods
or in the way of sleep.
Her smile was tainted,
yes, a mixture of concern
and reassuring nods,
framed by a mischievous
and  maiden born enthusiasm.
When she laid eyes on me
that busy day, when all of us
had come to get acquainted,
there in the yard, a cask or two
and green VB on bags of ice,
we clicked just for the heck of it,
it seemed. And if she judged
it did not show, for which I was
as always glad, she took you
as you were or as you sought to be.
A shadow flashed across her cheeks
that helter-skelter afternoon
when life demanded all her skills
and selflessly she had complied,
again. And then again.
There was a pain, a real pain
down in the very pit of things,
and instantly she had become
a woman of unusual perception.
She'd been, by way of cyberwaves
become aware. So sad for litle folks.
What would they do, let down as such
by what the gods had now decreed,
it would be such a pain to tell,
especially the little ones, she would
be so bereft of words, the granny
who had met the match,
the one who took her speech away
by cutting deep within that heart of gold
and twisting once or twice,
just to make sure she understood.
And then, when she awoke again,
to wrap the Christmas gifts for all,
she had to steady trembling hands
and sit in the recliner from last year,
a present  of her grown up son,
attorney to the world, respected
and the father of those little darlings
who would be, with smiles of happiness
and reddened cheeks rush to the tree
and rip the living daylights out of wraps
and bows and cartons made by boys
in sweatshops of new opportunity,
down old Kolkata Way.
She would be resting then,
inside a box of cypress or mahogany
and think about them all, with Joy,
her little ears alert to all the sounds
that were her life and warmed her heart
so long ago. It was a life lived by a flower,
who never lost the fragrance of a rose."
99,Emotion,JoyPoemsAJoyPoembySamanyanLakshminarayanan,"if it was a share
which gave you joy
how can you use it
as a ploy."
100,Emotion,SorrowPoemsAfghanisSorrowPoembyAfzalShauq,"If you look
upon Afghani's sorrow
Will you tell...
Does your heart
feel empathy...
Do tears  well
in your eyes...
The life of the Afghan
like open wounds
seeks healing
will kindness you extend
Oh Big Boss!
You the teacher
of brutal behavior
please step aside
for peace and prosperity.

101,Emotion,SorrowPoemsTheSeaOfSorrowPoembythepoet,"Tears of sorrow flows
Into the sea of sadness,
All the memories and dreams
Clouded with pain and agony.
The endless shadow of darkness,
Devours the land,
In the overwhelming vision,
Of lost hope and regrets,
Mirroring the shameful truth
Of grief in our hearts.
Why must we give in
To the senseless meaning of sorrow
O the irony
When It dominates our souls
Revealing its true face
Showing the weakness
Of our heart
Where minds are broken and lost
Where feelings are scrambled and
Confusion forms and frustration come to be,
No matter what happens,
This endless suffering will stay
Till bones are faded,
Along the sands of time.
“ People cry, and people try
not to cry, but only lies can they try…”"
102,Emotion,SorrowPoemsTheBlissOfSorrowPoembyJohannWolfgangvonGoethe,"NEVER dry, never dry,
Tears that eternal love sheddeth!
How dreary, how dead doth the world still appear,
When only half-dried on the eye is the tear!
Never dry, never dry,
Tears that unhappy love sheddeth!"
103,Emotion,SorrowPoemsSoundsOfSorrowPoembyBenGieske,"I pass the weeping willow,
wondering for whom it cries.
Could it be for all God’s children
falling like stars in the sky?
I hear the sound of blowing wind,
wondering for whom it moans.
Could it be for all God’s children
who must wander with no home?
I hear the sound of the lonely wolf,
wondering for whom it howls.
Could it be for all God’s children
who must sleep with empty bowels?
I hear the sound of the church bells,
wondering for whom they toll.
Perhaps they toll to remind all God’s children
to do the good deeds they were told."
104,Emotion,SorrowPoemsFreeVersePersonificationPoemSorrowOfMePoembyChantelleClark,"When sunsets for night sorrow drifts in, whispering through the trees.
Her gown flutters through the air  as she glides over me.
Setting quietness throughout the land,
In a dangerious whisper that gave me shivers.
The despair settled over me, as her calming deadly wrath,
Wrapped me in a blanket of sadness."
105,Emotion,SorrowPoemsNightJasmineTreeOfSorrowPoembyMamtaAgarwal,"Mild, balmy breeze,
Hauntingly fragrant
With Night Jasmine.
A small evergreen tree,
Twinkling
With ivory white flowers
In my garden,
Resplendent at night,
Like the star
Studded sky.
Before the day breaks,
The tree silently sheds
Its crowning glory
On Mother Earth’s breast.
To pay homage
In all humility.
Overcome with wonder
I find myself ponder,
As I gather the flowers
In my wicker basket
On my way to the temple.
To offer
To the deity
At the altar.
Oh, Harshingar,
Why are you
Called
The Tree of Sorrow?
Night Jasmine is called Harshingar and Paarijatta in India its
A sacred tree, grown in temples. Flowers are offered to the deity in the temples. there are many myths associated with it."
106,Emotion,SorrowPoemsTearsOfBloodTearsOfSorrowPoembyLisaBray,"Time flys leaving you.standing in the middle of the floor.
when you realize he's gone you fall  hopping he will return.
(a Tear falls to the floor)    and glass breaks.
Blood begins to shed when you gave up your life you gave up him.Time he realizes your gone he falls  to the floor hopping its not true.
That she would come back to you.(a tear falls)    and you pick up your gun.
A shot is Fired.
when u gave up your life for the girl you loved....
you got her back now you and her will forever stand with each other with out a end.
love lisa bray!"
107,Emotion,SorrowPoemsUntoldGripOfSorrowPoembyDrsubhendukar,"skin seems roasted by scorching rays
sky is burning by heat of summer
sultry weather remembers autumn’s flow
anger never reels through by fear of love.
softness mellows by sweet feeling
where is smile latching on into hide?
oh emotion be cup of anger retreating
silence miffed yet untold by grip of sorrow
night still seems resilient by tear as dew
heart loses its rhythm riling upon wisdom
abstruse stillness redeems from penitence
as the reality insists upon truth of reason
Sorrow redounds deep in darkness in furrows
Humor blurs in dearth of rippling smiles
Sadness rides over the glow of ingenuity
Do you ever measure the distance of love?"
108,Emotion,SorrowPoemsNoToSorrowPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"Can little sweetness be added to sorrow?
Can sadness be not pushed aside for tomorrow?
When both are interwoven to each other
Why to think of them more and bother?
Pure or true love can never deceive
Warmth and feelings we always receive
Best ideas emanate from within and peace be conceived
Does that speak of real intention as goal is perceived?
Let love speak and not remain or confine within
Eyes must reveal and nothing should remain in
It is very much essential and must prevail at last
Acceptance should be made known very fast
I must acknowledge it as God sent gift
Why to have in life more tussles and rift?
We should never change stand and shift
Switch over from one to another should be very swift
I am prepared to forgo prestige and pride
Why in love it should be sought and hide?
Simple admission of true feelings and no guilt
Trust the opinion and strong foundation to be built
I shall seek no favor in return
Let my love grow and cause no concern
Earnest desire must be explained in turn
Let there be real union without any heart burn
May be in my life today is the happiest day
I will continue to seek and have my way
Let her remain true to her conscience and say
Never will we be separated, come what may!
Things may prove difficult if it turns out differently
Both have to think it honestly and approach separately
Time may run out us and not allow us to unite
Passion may remain passion only and within ignite
We may take steps to see that it doesn’t turn ugly
It may be too early also to forecast it so early
Still it will remain our top priority to tackle the issue
We must get in turn what ever is destined to be due
We will not be cowed down with by unexpected events
We will face it bravely when it is made known very next moment
We will not allow it to happen and take us completely by surprise
But all possibilities are definitely there and bound to arise
We shall from now on shed no tears and face the reality
We shall stand firm and come up bravely for any eventuality
It has to be faced with as if dealing with any of the disaster
We must carve out the way and destiny as done by master"
109,Emotion,SorrowPoemsTheSorrowOfSorrowPoembyRameshTA,"If we love a thing, a flower, Nature or a person, it is
Indeed a natural feeling of heart that settles in mind;
If we lose a thing, we get another thing in its place;
If we lose a flower, we get another one, but not a person!
Nature is eternal, but all others appear and disappear;
But humans with heart and mind it is difficult to lose
The loved ones that cannot be regained in the world...;
Grown ups may manage themselves, but what about a child?
The child remembers the loved ones deeply in heart ever;
The child may forget by diversion on so many new things;
The child may grow up, but never forgets the loved ones;
How can the child bear, if loved ones pass away regularly?
The longing of child grows bringing in the sorrow of life;
Like the darkness slowly occupies in full the whole place,
Sorrow engulfs the heart of joyful child, if all loved ones
Pass away one after the other in the journey of life here!
This kind of sorrow how can the child bear and manage ever
Is a big question heartens me much, when I recollect the
Deep love of a child on me after the demise of my better-
Half sometime back in my life never leaving my mind sure!"
110,Emotion,SorrowPoemsATimeToBurySorrowPoembydavidlessard,"A time for you and a time for me,
to be whatever, we choose to be;
to set our sights, to reach the peak,
to realize goals, we truly seek.
A time to dwell. on things long past,
a time to think, on things that last;
on family, friends and things that matter,
on things that endure and do not scattter.
A time to laugh and a time to weep,
a time for treasured things to keep;
a time for reflection on how we feel,
a time to mend and a time to heal.
A time to live and a time to die,
a time for joy and a time to cry;
a time to smile and a time for tears,
a time for God to calm our fears.
A time to despose of loved ones dead,
A time to get on with the day ahead;
To blot out death and face the 'morrow,
To clear the mind and bury sorrow."
111,Emotion,SorrowPoemsInterludeSongsOutOfSorrowPoembySaraTeasdale,"I.  Spirit's House
From naked stones of agony
I will build a house for me;
As a mason all alone
I will raise it, stone by stone,
And every stone where I have bled
Will show a sign of dusky red.
I have not gone the way in vain,
For I have good of all my pain;
My spirit's quiet house will be
Built of naked stones I trod
On roads where I lost sight of God.
II.  Mastery
I would not have a god come in
To shield me suddenly from sin,
And set my house of life to rights;
Nor angels with bright burning wings
Ordering my earthly thoughts and things;
Rather my own frail guttering lights
Wind blown and nearly beaten out;
Rather the terror of the nights
And long, sick groping after doubt;
Rather be lost than let my soul
Slip vaguely from my own control --
Of my own spirit let me be
In sole though feeble mastery.
III.  Lessons
Unless I learn to ask no help
From any other soul but mine,
To seek no strength in waving reeds
Nor shade beneath a straggling pine;
Unless I learn to look at Grief
Unshrinking from her tear-blind eyes,
And take from Pleasure fearlessly
Whatever gifts will make me wise --
Unless I learn these things on earth,
Why was I ever given birth?
IV.  Wisdom
When I have ceased to break my wings
Against the faultiness of things,
And learned that compromises wait
Behind each hardly opened gate,
When I can look Life in the eyes,
Grown calm and very coldly wise,
Life will have given me the Truth,
And taken in exchange -- my youth.
V.  In a Burying Ground
This is the spot where I will lie
When life has had enough of me,
These are the grasses that will blow
Above me like a living sea.
These gay old lilies will not shrink
To draw their life from death of mine,
And I will give my body's fire
To make blue flowers on this vine.
""O Soul,"" I said, ""have you no tears?
Was not the body dear to you?""
I heard my soul say carelessly,
""The myrtle flowers will grow more blue.""
VI.  Wood Song
I heard a wood thrush in the dusk
Twirl three notes and make a star --
My heart that walked with bitterness
Came back from very far.
Three shining notes were all he had,
And yet they made a starry call --
I caught life back against my breast
And kissed it, scars and all.
VII.  Refuge
From my spirit's gray defeat,
From my pulse's flagging beat,
From my hopes that turned to sand
Sifting through my close-clenched hand,
From my own fault's slavery,
If I can sing, I still am free.
For with my singing I can make
A refuge for my spirit's sake,
A house of shining words, to be
My fragile immortality."
112,Emotion,SorrowPoemsAMothersSorrowPoembyRachelFogle,"Heartbeat so strong,
Beating fast holding on.
Mothers tears falling down,
Slowly allowing time to fade round.
Guilty conscience its ok,
No time for sadness,
No time for blame.
Doctors that come bringing sadness and hope,
Reality sinks in dose by dose.
Gentle hand, beautiful smile.
Nothing like the love of ones child.
Anger at all that's happened and still,
Cannot change what must be gods will.
Families that circle and bring comfort to all.
Will share ones strength when the other must fall.
Stronger men have come and gone.
While women have wept and stood strong to carry on.
No matter the distance,
Or time and space,
Heartache will heal,
And the emptyness fade."
113,Emotion,SorrowPoemsSorrowOfDeparturePoembyLiChingChao,"Red lotus incense fades on
The jeweled curtain. Autumn
Comes again. Gently I open
My silk dress and float alone
On the orchid boat. Who can
Take a letter beyond the clouds?
Only the wild geese come back
And write their ideograms
On the sky under the full
Moon that floods the West Chamber.
Flowers, after their kind, flutter
And scatter. Water after
Its nature, when spilt, at last
Gathers again in one place.
Creatures of the same species
Long for each other. But we
Are far apart and I have
Grown learned in sorrow.
Nothing can make it dissolve
And go away. One moment,
It is on my eyebrows.
The next, it weighs on my heart."
114,Emotion,SorrowPoemsSorrowPoembyDavidKowalczyk,"Remember
your tears
are only water."
115,Emotion,SorrowPoemsBlastFromThePastIQuotSorrowQuotPoembyAparnaSinha,"Tears that are in my eyes
are not-Sorrow of barren Land
Where life barely exists
And sound of rain is lost in ocean of sand
Where life pass, years! Seeking the skies
Waiting for watery drop
Even like a tear that dropp from my eye
Its not a sorrow of a princess
Whose love is apart
Her affection grows everyday
But she cannot express her heart
Its not agony of a woman
Whose man is on way to disaster
Nor pain of mother
Whose son made devil his master
Its not wail of a child
Whose dreams are broken like stars
Nor pain of those
Whose friends are dying in wars
Its nota lament after tempest
Nor the cry after death
Tear in my eyes
Is due to my inner sorrow
For the world I live in is crying dying
And am I not to grieve over something which is mine?
(P.S.written when I was in 8th std…. I copied and pasted the whole poem as it is…)"
116,Emotion,SorrowPoemsThisIsMySorrowPoembyRmShanmugamChettiar,"The women of your age I train my eyes on
Remind me of you through some resemblances
And some violent contrasts now and then.
Nose studs and ear drops I see in the shops
Catch my eyes and bring to my view your face.
I imagine the stud worn on your nose
And with that how your nose would tempt my lips.
I imagine the drops hung from your ears
And with that how your ears would prompt me.
When I am lonely you are in my thought;
I dream of passing my hand through your hair
And gazing into your eyes full of love.
To bring this about, I must conquer Fate
As I accuse myself of cowardice.
I have no courage nor propriety
Even to let you know my feelings.
This is my sorrow that cripples my mind.
This is my agony underlining.

And everyday my sorrow is there"
118,Emotion,SorrowPoemsMotherDayANeglectedMothersLonelinessAndSorrowPoembyUWinKyi,"Every year on Mother Day,
I have many words to say,
from here Old-Age home where I stay,
to my children who live far, far away,
who are too busy, a visit they rarely pay.
My hairs are becoming sparse and gray,
My teeth decay,
and break away,
My mind depresses and in dismay,
My nervous response slow and delays,
My memory forgetful and in disarray,
My legs weak and walk in sway,
I feel so gloomy when the day is without sun-rays,
I feel so scare when the night is without moon-light spray,
I keep the toys made of clay,
with which in your young age, you played,
to keep the boredom at bay.
I keep these toys to prevent sorrow which wants to slay,
my lonely heart which already is frail and  frayed.
To my grandchildren, a Filial Piety, you need to display,
so that they would know how to obey,
to you when you are old in later days.
Otherwise they would say 'nay, '
and do according to the way,
you did to me before, down into the grave, I lay."
119,Emotion,SorrowPoemsInSorrowPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"In sorrow
She mourns her beloved son
What's next to follow
No one knows
In sorrow
He mourns his beloved daughter
What's next to follow
His heart is hollow
In sorrow
She mourns her beloved husband
What's next to follow
She is now a widow
In sorrow
He mourns his beloved wife
What's next to follow
His desire for life is renounced to zero
In sorrow
They mourn the passing of a dear friend
Someone they wished to be there tomorrow
It hurts without pretext, whatever sorrow sends
And we know and I know
Sorrow returns not the life's it borrows
Sorrow is a walking deadly shadow
Sorrow is the virus we dread tomorrow
Sorrow is the devils spell of lethal horrors
Therefore my dear fellows
In sorrow no more I mourn her sorrow
In sorrow
I have closed on her all my doors and windows

120,Emotion,SorrowPoemsTheSongOfSorrowPoemby0Zero,"Once I heard the song of sadness,
T'was full of melancholy pure.
I sat and listened for what seemed to be forever,
It seemed to be joy's cure.
Never again can you think the same,
Once you've heard such a song.
Never again can you live the same,
Once you know what's truly right and wrong.
I fell into pieces,
I lost all my hope.
I whithered away,
There was no way to cope.
Now I've joined the chior,
I am not alone.
I sing the song of sorrow and madness,
Chilling listeners to the bone."
121,Emotion,SorrowPoemsYourSorrowAndMySorrowPoembyRICBASTASA,"your sorrow and my sorrow
are not really ours to keep.
They belong to the earth,
to the heart of the earth

there, secure and honed.
we are leaving now to
another sphere, the one
that we see in our dreams
the more colored ones

yourself poised to something
more lasting more divine."

Why have you left me in such a big hole

Sorrow, sorrow its time to go
and let your heart be with your soul"
123,Emotion,SorrowPoemsOnAnothersSorrowPoembyWilliamBlake,"Can I see another's woe,
And not be in sorrow too?
Can I see another's grief,
And not seek for kind relief?
Can I see a falling tear,
And not feel my sorrow's share?
Can a father see his child
Weep, nor be with sorrow filled?
Can a mother sit and hear
An infant groan, an infant fear?
No, no!  never can it be!
Never, never can it be!
And can He who smiles on all
Hear the wren with sorrows small,
Hear the small bird's grief and care,
Hear the woes that infants bear --
And not sit beside the next,
Pouring pity in their breast,
And not sit the cradle near,
Weeping tear on infant's tear?
And not sit both night and day,
Wiping all our tears away?
Oh no! never can it be!
Never, never can it be!
He doth give his joy to all:
He becomes an infant small,
He becomes a man of woe,
He doth feel the sorrow too.
Think not thou canst sigh a sigh,
And thy Maker is not by:
Think not thou canst weep a tear,
And thy Maker is not year.
Oh He gives to us his joy,
That our grief He may destroy:
Till our grief is fled an gone
He doth sit by us and moan."
124,Emotion,SorrowPoemsKinToSorrowPoembyEdnaStVincentMillay,"Am I kin to Sorrow,
That so oft
Falls the knocker of my door——
Neither loud nor soft,
But as long accustomed,
Under Sorrow's hand?
Marigolds around the step
And rosemary stand,
And then comes Sorrow—
And what does Sorrow care
For the rosemary
Or the marigolds there?
Am I kin to Sorrow?
Are we kin?
That so oft upon my door—
Oh, come in!"

126,Emotion,SorrowPoemsInMemoriam3OSorrowCruelFellowshipPoembyAlfredLordTennyson,"O Sorrow, cruel fellowship,
O Priestess in the vaults of Death,
O sweet and bitter in a breath,
What whispers from thy lying lip?
""The stars,"" she whispers, ""blindly run;
A web is wov'n across the sky;
From out waste places comes a cry,
And murmurs from the dying sun:
""And all the phantom, Nature, stands--
With all the music in her tone,
A hollow echo of my own,--
A hollow form with empty hands.""
And shall I take a thing so blind,
Embrace her as my natural good;
Or crush her, like a vice of blood,
Upon the threshold of the mind?"
127,Emotion,SorrowPoemsTheWindOfSorrowPoembyHenryVanDyke,"The fire of love was burning, yet so low
That in the dark we scarce could see its rays,
And in the light of perfect-placid days
Nothing but smouldering embers dull and slow.
Vainly, for love's delight, we sought to throw
New pleasures on the pyre to make it blaze:
In life's calm air and tranquil-prosperous ways
We missed the radiant heat of long ago.
Then in the night, a night of sad alarms,
Bitter with pain and black with fog of fears,
That drove us trembling to each other's arms --
Across the gulf of darkness and salt tears,
Into life's calm the wind of sorrow came,
And fanned the fire of love to clearest flame."
128,Emotion,SorrowPoemsHasSorrowThyYoungDaysShadedPoembyThomasMoore,"Has sorrow thy young days shaded,
As clouds o'er the morning fleet?
Too fast have those young days faded
That, even in sorrow, were sweet?
Does Time with his cold wing wither
Each feeling that once was dear? --
Then, child of misfortune, come hither,
I'll weep with thee, tear for tear.
Has love to that soul, so tender,
Been like our Lagenian mine,
Where sparkles of golden splendour
All over the surface shine --
But, if in pursuit we go deeper,
Allured by the gleam that shone,
Ah! false as the dream of the sleeper,
Like Love, the bright ore is gone.
Has Hope, like the bird in the story,
That flitted from tree to tree
With the talisman's glittering glory --
Has Hope been that bird to thee?
On branch after branch alighting,
The gem did she still display,
And, when nearest, and most inviting,
Then waft the fair gem away?
If thus the young hours have fleeted,
When sorrow itself look'd bright;
If thus the fair hope hath cheated,
That led thee along so light;
If thus the cold world now wither
Each feeling that once was dear --
Come, child of misfortune, come hither,
I'll weep with thee, tear for tear."
129,Emotion,SorrowPoemsLemonSorrowPoembySamanthaGuinen,"Have you ever tasted sorrow,
I think it taste like lemons,
If all feelings had a taste i think of lemons,
They can be sour then can get sweet,
Lemons sweet or sour then comes the sorrow taste,
Sorrow taste of rain,
Sorrow taste of lemons,"
130,Emotion,SorrowPoemsforAFriendInTimeOfHerConstantSorrowPoembyTedSheridan,"My dear friend, but for clouds in your eyes;
The sun failed to rise. But rise it did today,
Just as it always has and always will.
The sunshine and light you seek is not to be found
Even on the fairest of days, but rather it can be found
In the heart, where your Joy has retreated for protection
For a safe haven given its constant overexposure.
You give joy with every kind act you perform, and
With every smile you so freely provide to all,
Yet the one thing you are missing in your life
Is a true love of your very own. You search for this love
In the morning sun, when perhaps the lover you seek
Can be found standing in an evening rain,
His eyes beaming with the love he brings…

131,Emotion,SorrowPoemsHelpMeToSaltHelpMeToSorrowPoembyJudyJordan,"In the moon-fade and the sun’s puppy breath,
in the crow’s plummeting cry,
in my broken foot and arthritic joints,
memory calls me
to the earth’s opening, the graves dug, again, and again
I, always I am left
to turn away
into a bat’s wing-brush of air.
That never changes . . .
not this morning, not here
where I’ve just found
in the back of my truck, under the rubber mat,
in a teacup’s worth of dirt,
where it seems no seed could possibly be
a corn kernel split to pale leaves and string-roots.
It’s a strange leap but I make it
and bend to these small harvests
because somewhere in North Carolina there was a house
and in it, my room and my bed,
bare boards and the blood stains of a man
that in each slant rain’s worried whispers puddles to the cries of a slave,
murdered in 1863 trying to escape.
Somewhere there was a child who slept
on the living room’s red-vinyl couch
who still matters
especially now that I can’t remember when the creek
that bounded our family farm led to an ocean
or when a boxcar’s weather-wasted letters spelling Illinois
meant somewhere there was an Illinois.
It’s still 1976--
the day after I’ve been seen playing tennis
with a black boy, and it seems I will always
be held at gunpoint and beaten
as if the right punch would chunk out his name.
--------
No, it’s 1969--
The year my mother becomes a wax paste,
or so she looks to the child I was,
and she drips into the pink satin
and I learned the funereal smell of carnations.
That year the moon was still made of green cheese.
That year men first bagged and labeled that moon.
There are no years, only the past
and I still don’t know why Odell Horne
pulled a shotgun on my brother
or how the body contains so much blood.
I still don’t know why Donna Hill went to Myrtle Beach
and three days later came back dead.
For ten years I lived with Louise Stegall,
the lover of my father, one of her four men, all buried--
suicide, murder, drink, again murder.
It was after the second one that she sat stock still
and silent, four years in the asylum.
Now she walks the road all day,
picking up Cracker Jack trinkets
to give to children
brave enough to approach her.
When I was nine, the starling pecked outside her windowa whole week.
Somebody’s gonna die, she said
and made me hug Uncle Robert’s neck
as if I couldn’t know he’d be gone in two hours,
as if I hadn’t learned anything about people
and their vanishing.
The last time I saw her she wouldn’t look at me,
jerked her sweatshirt’s hood across
her face and stepped into the ditch,
as though there are some things even she won’t tell,
as though I’ve never known it’s dirt and dust after all--
the earth’s sink and the worms’ castings.
--------
With the wet leaves thick on my steps,
the evening sky bruised dull gray to black,
when I’ve spilt salt and as the saying goes the sorrow and tears,
and the stove is cold so salt won’t burn,
tell me my pocket of charms can counter any spell.
Tell me again the reason for my grandfather’s fingers
afloat in the Mason jar on the fireplace mantel
between the snuff tin and the bowl of circus peanuts.
What about the teeth in the dresser bureau,
the sliver of back bone I wear around my neck?
Again the washed-out photo in the family album,
Pacific wind lifting the small waves onto Coral Beach,
clicking the palm trees’ fronds.
Again my father’s rakish grin,
his bayonet catching a scratch of sun,
his left foot propped on the stripped and bloodied body.
Behind him, a stack of Japanese.
--------
Let me believe in anything.
Doesn’t the grizzled chicken dig up hoodoo hands?
Won’t the blue door frame, the basket of acorns protect me;
what about the knife in a pail of water?
When giving me the dead’s slippered feet
room to room,
why not also synchronicity’s proof,
a wish and the tilted ears of angels?
I want to believe in the power of rosemary
knuckled along the fence
even as the stars order themselves
to an unalterable and essential law.
I want the wind-whipped leaves to settle
and the flattened scrub to right itself,
want the loose tin in the neighbor’s shed
to finish its message.
When this season in its scoured exactitude shifts closer,
give me Devil’s Blue Boletus through the piled leaves,
the slender green of Earth Tongue,
phosphorescent Honey Tuft dispatched by the dead.
Their voices coming nearer, almost deciphered.
Whatever lies you have
there in that nail-clipping of time,
give them to me."
132,Emotion,SorrowPoemsAKindOfSorrowASecretSufferingPoembyRICBASTASA,"to lose you i know is one kind sorrow
for i claim a loss that i never had even once owned.
a play of words, and i know you do not understand
what each word means, what a punctuation is.
this heart that grieves for what it cannot even touch
with its fragile hands, its trembling fingers
for what i see is but a glimmer
a faint light, a shadow, a hush, a slight glimpse
no one knows what secret suffering is all about
(secret so to say, i give it a language of its own)
a heart that bleeds without drops of blood
a heart injured yet without the bruises and wound
i mix with the crowd just like what we do when we go malling.
i smile like the way all people smile. i always have a glimpse of you.
yet i know, i do not wait for anybody, or anything, this is simply
an impossible endeavor. Clouds that dissipate. Air that vanish.
a door that closes. a bus that leaves. a plane turning into a dot in space.
i look up actually for nothing. i  pretend sometimes that there are stars where there are none but black clouds and tree tops.
i look down and only see suffering. Pebbles and gray sands.
i sleep without remembering my dreams. i wake up not thinking
about what to do specifically with  my life. I have everything you say.
but since i do not have you, i am still nothing. I am simply arms emptied
of its embrace. I am hands groping with nothing but space.
it does not matter. i touch my chest and feel that i am strong.
i give up the gift of speech. I take in the gift of words written in utter silence."
133,Emotion,SorrowPoemsILlNotConferWithSorrowPoembyThomasBaileyAldrich,"I'll not confer with Sorrow
Till to-morrow;
But Joy shall have her way
This very day.
Ho, eglantine and cresses
For her tresses!--
Let Care, the beggar, wait
Outside the gate.
Tears if you will--but after
Mirth and laughter;
Then, folded hands on breast
And endless rest."
134,Emotion,SorrowPoemsGripOfSorrowPoembyDrsubhendukar,"skin seems roasted by scorching rays
sky is burning by heat of summer
sultry weather remembers autumn’s flow
anger never reels through by fear of love.
softness mellows by sweet feeling
where is smile latching on to hide?
oh emotion be cup of anger retreating
silence even tells grip of sorrow
night still resilient by tear as dew
heart loses its rhythm riling upon wisdom
abstruse stillness redeems from apprehension
as truth of reason always insist upon realty.
Sorrow redounds deep in darkness in furrow
Humor blurs in dearth of rippling smiles
Sadness rides over the glow ingenious
Do you ever measure the distance of love?"
135,Emotion,SorrowPoemsPainAndSorrowPoembyMandyLee,"Tears fill my heart,
I cry in the darkness,
I cry in the shadows,
I cry in the moonlight,
alone and afraid.
The pain engulfs me,
taking me away,
yet keeping me chained.
My mind screams,
my body aches,
for these painful memories
are forever etched in my heart."
136,Emotion,SorrowPoemsSorrowPoembyNeilLarkin,"My soul is cold as ice.
My heart is darker then the void.
Nothing seems nice.
All happiness devoid.
I feel nothing.
Except that of pain.
I've looked for that one something.
But I just ended up crying in the rain.
My tears are dry.
They could fill the deepest oceans.
The end seems nigh.
There is only pain, no other emotions.
My hope, my life...shattered.
I cannot pick up the pieces.
It's not like I mattered.
But my sorrow increases.
I have been mocked, betrayed, and destroyed.
No medication can numb my hurt.
All those around me seem overjoyed.
When my face is shoved into the dirt.
My God has left me.
Sitting up in his throne.
I did not want to be his enemy.
I'll just sit here and moan.
My love has thrown me aside.
Like damaged goods.
I wish I just would have died.
In a grave unmarked in the deepest of woods.
And so here I am.
I am not sure if I will be alive tomorrow.
I just don't give a damn.
I am going to drown in my sorrow."

138,Emotion,SorrowPoemsWouldstILiveWithTearsOfSorrowPoembyDavidTaylor,"Wouldst I live with tears of sorrow
fearful of what will come the morrow,
yearning for past times of glee
thinking back on thee.
Wouldst I live with sadness borrowed
from the losses of life's furrows,
walking forward in the past
lamenting what has gone so fast.
Wouldst I live for a rosy future
one that promises another way
that will make a brighter day,
and all the while I am right here
living in a state of fear.
Leaving past to memories locker
and the future not yet formed
I will not; cannot follow.
All that holds the gift of life
is present now and free from strife,
in this moment full of potential
is the answer existential.
Giving light and holding faith
never lacking; full of grace.
Looking back I loose my self
when all that's needed is belief
that this ever present moment
frees me from all the causes of my grief."
139,Emotion,SorrowPoemsInTimeOfSorrowPoembyRobertFullerMurray,"Despair is in the suns that shine,
And in the rains that fall,
This sad forsaken soul of mine
Is weary of them all.
They fall and shine on alien streets
From those I love and know.
I cannot hear amid the heats
The North Sea's freshening flow
The people hurry up and down,
Like ghosts that cannot lie;
And wandering through the phantom town
The weariest ghost am I."
140,Emotion,SorrowPoemsPainAndSorrowPoembysylviaspencer,"What of life as the sun rises away from the cloud of doom.
Is there a place that is without doom and gloom.
Is there a far distant land where life is full of fun, and is there a
land where life does not have to look down the barral of a gun,
Torment and sorrow as far as we can see but life could be so
different if everyone was free
Free from hunger, free from pain, but there is never a break
it always remains the same. Sex abused kids and the
want for food, what is the meaning of this modern brood.
Can we change this perfectic world and find a life without sadness
and sorrow, can it happen now or do we wait until tomorrow.
Tomorrow never comes as everyone knows, but the pain and sorrow
just grows and grows.
There is a chance that the world could live as one,
but not while we are looking down the barrel of a gun.
Every country has it's own rule, but it's the people that live there are
made to look the fool."
141,Emotion,SorrowPoemsSorrowPoembyEdnaStVincentMillay,"Sorrow like a ceaseless rain
Beats upon my heart.
People twist and scream in pain,—
Dawn will find them still again;
This has neither wax nor wane,
Neither stop nor start.
People dress and go to town;
I sit in my chair.
All my thoughts are slow and brown:
Standing up or sitting down
Little matters, or what gown
Or what shoes I wear."
142,Emotion,SorrowPoemsUnderTheSorrowTreePoembyDeenaMetzger,"By the river,
under the sorrow tree,
the universe says
the bones must dance,
and she, who goes out with a net
to catch the spirits,
returns, her hands filled
only with the dark briars
we have hummed
these many years.
The one who sees sorrow
cannot staunch it,
yet by her side
something white
announces itself.
The bones are sucked clean,
the one nearest the heart
becomes a flute,
when you blow,
the dead come
and behind them,
the other bones in a circle
The universe says
loss demands birth
and the two
are lovers."
143,Emotion,SorrowPoemsSweetSorrowPoembyFaySlimm,"Yes, our partings have progressed to become
Sorrowed but sweet.
Trusting tomorrow, reluctantly we
Tear, discreetly
Away, obeying no impulse to stay.
Holding back beats
Of incredible passion, our hearts now
Part, retreating
With hope that Fate soon discloses some way
Of completing
Destiny's call. Our yearnings, now braided
Round sorrow's feet
Can then seat themselves at Heaven's sweet door.
Then meetings
Can flourish fulfilled, - replete forevermore."
144,Emotion,SorrowPoemsSorrowPoembyadamcliff,"the tear of sorrow runs down my cheek
friendship is what I seek
I used to think I had it all
but now my backs against the wall
and my heart has been broken
and these words are unspoken
I look back at my past
and wish the sorrow would end my life at last..."
145,Emotion,SorrowPoemsGuiltAndSorrowPoembyWilliamWordsworth,"I
A traveller on the skirt of Sarum's Plain
Pursued his vagrant way, with feet half bare;
Stooping his gait, but not as if to gain
Help from the staff he bore; for mien and air
Were hardy, though his cheek seemed worn with care
Both of the time to come, and time long fled:
Down fell in straggling locks his thin grey hair;
A coat he wore of military red
But faded, and stuck o'er with many a patch and shred.
II
While thus he journeyed, step by step led on,
He saw and passed a stately inn, full sure
That welcome in such house for him was none.
No board inscribed the needy to allure
Hung there, no bush proclaimed to old and poor
And desolate, ""Here you will find a friend!""
The pendent grapes glittered above the door;--
On he must pace, perchance 'till night descend,
Where'er the dreary roads their bare white lines extend.
III
The gathering clouds grow red with stormy fire,
In streaks diverging wide and mounting high;
That inn he long had passed; the distant spire,
Which oft as he looked back had fixed his eye,
Was lost, though still he looked, in the blank sky.
Perplexed and comfortless he gazed around,
And scarce could any trace of man descry,
Save cornfields stretched and stretching without bound;
But where the sower dwelt was nowhere to be found.
IV
No tree was there, no meadow's pleasant green,
No brook to wet his lip or soothe his ear;
Long files of corn-stacks here and there were seen,
But not one dwelling-place his heart to cheer.
Some labourer, thought he, may perchance be near;
And so he sent a feeble shout--in vain;
No voice made answer, he could only hear
Winds rustling over plots of unripe grain,
Or whistling thro' thin grass along the unfurrowed plain.
V
Long had he fancied each successive slope
Concealed some cottage, whither he might turn
And rest; but now along heaven's darkening cope
The crows rushed by in eddies, homeward borne.
Thus warned he sought some shepherd's spreading thorn
Or hovel from the storm to shield his head,
But sought in vain; for now, all wild, forlorn,
And vacant, a huge waste around him spread;
The wet cold ground, he feared, must be his only bed.
VI
And be it so--for to the chill night shower
And the sharp wind his head he oft hath bared;
A Sailor he, who many a wretched hour
Hath told; for, landing after labour hard,
Full long endured in hope of just reward,
He to an armed fleet was forced away
By seamen, who perhaps themselves had shared
Like fate; was hurried off, a helpless prey,
'Gainst all that in 'his' heart, or theirs perhaps, said nay.
VII
For years the work of carnage did not cease,
And death's dire aspect daily he surveyed,
Death's minister; then came his glad release,
And hope returned, and pleasure fondly made
Her dwelling in his dreams. By Fancy's aid
The happy husband flies, his arms to throw
Round his wife's neck; the prize of victory laid
In her full lap, he sees such sweet tears flow
As if thenceforth nor pain nor trouble she could know.
VIII
Vain hope! for frand took all that he had earned.
The lion roars and gluts his tawny brood
Even in the desert's heart; but he, returned,
Bears not to those he loves their needful food.
His home approaching, but in such a mood
That from his sight his children might have run.
He met a traveller, robbed him, shed his blood;
And when the miserable work was done
He fled, a vagrant since, the murderer's fate to shun.
IX
From that day forth no place to him could be
So lonely, but that thence might come a pang
Brought from without to inward misery.
Now, as he plodded on, with sullen clang
A sound of chains along the desert rang;
He looked, and saw upon a gibbet high
A human body that in irons swang,
Uplifted by the tempest whirling by;
And, hovering, round it often did a raven fly.
X
It was a spectacle which none might view,
In spot so savage, but with shuddering pain;
Nor only did for him at once renew
All he had feared from man, but roused a train
Of the mind's phantoms, horrible as vain.
The stones, as if to cover him from day,
Rolled at his back along the living plain;
He fell, and without sense or motion lay;
But, when the trance was gone, feebly pursued his way.
XI
As one whose brain habitual phrensy fires
Owes to the fit in which his soul hath tossed
Profounder quiet, when the fit retires,
Even so the dire phantasma which had crossed
His sense, in sudden vacancy quite lost,
Left his mind still as a deep evening stream.
Nor, if accosted now, in thought engrossed,
Moody, or inly troubled, would he seem
To traveller who might talk of any casual theme.
XII
Hurtle the clouds in deeper darkness piled,
Gone is the raven timely rest to seek;
He seemed the only creature in the wild
On whom the elements their rage might wreak;
Save that the bustard, of those regions bleak
Shy tenant, seeing by the uncertain light
A man there wandering, gave a mournful shriek,
And half upon the ground, with strange affright,
Forced hard against the wind a thick unwieldy flight.
XIII
All, all was cheerless to the horizon's bound;
The weary eye--which, wheresoe'er it strays,
Marks nothing but the red sun's setting round,
Or on the earth strange lines, in former days
Left by gigantic arms--at length surveys
What seems an antique castle spreading wide;
Hoary and naked are its walls, and raise
Their brow sublime: in shelter there to bide
He turned, while rain poured down smoking on every side.
XIV
Pile of Stone-henge! so proud to hint yet keep
Thy secrets, thou that lov'st to stand and hear
The Plain resounding to the whirlwind's sweep,
Inmate of lonesome Nature's endless year;
Even if thou saw'st the giant wicker rear
For sacrifice its throngs of living men,
Before thy face did ever wretch appear,
Who in his heart had groaned with deadlier pain
Than he who, tempest-driven, thy shelter now would gain.
XV
Within that fabric of mysterious form,
Winds met in conflict, each by turns supreme;
And, from the perilous ground dislodged, through storm
And rain he wildered on, no moon to stream
From gulf of parting clouds one friendly beam,
Nor any friendly sound his footsteps led;
Once did the lightning's faint disastrous gleam
Disclose a naked guide-post's double head,
Sight which tho' lost at once a gleam of pleasure shed.
XVI
No swinging sign-board creaked from cottage elm
To stay his steps with faintness overcome;
'Twas dark and void as ocean's watery realm
Roaring with storms beneath night's starless gloom;
No gipsy cowered o'er fire of furze or broom;
No labourer watched his red kiln glaring bright,
Nor taper glimmered dim from sick man's room;
Along the waste no line of mournful light
From lamp of lonely toll-gate streamed athwart the night.
XVII
At length, though hid in clouds, the moon arose;
The downs were visible--and now revealed
A structure stands, which two bare slopes enclose.
It was a spot, where, ancient vows fulfilled,
Kind pious hands did to the Virgin build
A lonely Spital, the belated swain
From the night terrors of that waste to shield:
But there no human being could remain,
And now the walls are named the ""Dead House"" of the plain.
XVIII
Though he had little cause to love the abode
Of man, or covet sight of mortal face,
Yet when faint beams of light that ruin showed,
How glad he was at length to find some trace
Of human shelter in that dreary place.
Till to his flock the early shepherd goes,
Here shall much-needed sleep his frame embrace.
In a dry nook where fern the floor bestrows
He lays his stiffened limbs,--his eyes begin to close;
XIX
When hearing a deep sigh, that seemed to come
From one who mourned in sleep, he raised his head,
And saw a woman in the naked room
Outstretched, and turning on a restless bed:
The moon a wan dead light around her shed.
He waked her--spake in tone that would not fail,
He hoped, to calm her mind; but ill he sped,
For of that ruin she had heard a tale
Which now with freezing thoughts did all her powers assail;
XX
Had heard of one who, forced from storms to shroud,
Felt the loose walls of this decayed Retreat
Rock to incessant neighings shrill and loud,
While his horse pawed the floor with furious heat;
Till on a stone, that sparkled to his feet,
Struck, and still struck again, the troubled horse:
The man half raised the stone with pain and sweat,
Half raised, for well his arm might lose its force
Disclosing the grim head of a late murdered corse.
XXI
Such tale of this lone mansion she had learned
And, when that shape, with eyes in sleep half drowned,
By the moon's sullen lamp she first discerned,
Cold stony horror all her senses bound.
Her he addressed in words of cheering sound;
Recovering heart, like answer did she make;
And well it was that, of the corse there found,
In converse that ensued she nothing spake;
She knew not what dire pangs in him such tale could wake.
XXII
But soon his voice and words of kind intent
Banished that dismal thought; and now the wind
In fainter howlings told its 'rage' was spent:
Meanwhile discourse ensued of various kind,
Which by degrees a confidence of mind
And mutual interest failed not to create.
And, to a natural sympathy resigned,
In that forsaken building where they sate
The Woman thus retraced her own untoward fate.
XXIII
""By Derwent's side my father dwelt--a man
Of virtuous life, by pious parents bred;
And I believe that, soon as I began
To lisp, he made me kneel beside my bed,
And in his hearing there my prayers I said:
And afterwards, by my good father taught,
I read, and loved the books in which I read;
For books in every neighbouring house I sought,
And nothing to my mind a sweeter pleasure brought.
XXIV
""A little croft we owned--a plot of corn,
A garden stored with peas, and mint, and thyme,
And flowers for posies, oft on Sunday morn
Plucked while the church bells rang their earliest chime.
Can I forget our freaks at shearing time!
My hen's rich nest through long grass scarce espied;
The cowslip-gathering in June's dewy prime;
The swans that with white chests upreared in pride
Rushing and racing came to meet me at the water-side.
XXV
""The staff I well remember which upbore
The bending body of my active sire;
His seat beneath the honied sycamore
Where the bees hummed, and chair by winter fire;
When market-morning came, the neat attire
With which, though bent on haste, myself I decked;
Our watchful house-dog, that would tease and tire
The stranger till its barking-fit I checked;
The red-breast, known for years, which at my casement pecked.
XXVI
""The suns of twenty summers danced along,--
Too little marked how fast they rolled away:
But, through severe mischance and cruel wrong,
My father's substance fell into decay:
We toiled and struggled, hoping for a day
When Fortune might put on a kinder look;
But vain were wishes, efforts vain as they;
He from his old hereditary nook
Must part; the summons came;--our final leave we took.
XXVII
""It was indeed a miserable hour
When, from the last hill-top, my sire surveyed,
Peering above the trees, the steeple tower
That on his marriage day sweet music made!
Tilt then, he hoped his bones might there be laid
Close by my mother in their native bowers:
Bidding me trust in God, he stood and prayed;--
I could not pray:--through tears that fell in showers
Glimmered our dear-loved home, alas! no longer ours!
XXVIII
""There was a Youth whom I had loved so long,
That when I loved him not I cannot say:
'Mid the green mountains many a thoughtless song
We two had sung, like gladsome birds in May;
When we began to tire of childish play,
We seemed still more and more to prize each other;
We talked of marriage and our marriage day;
And I in truth did love him like a brother,
For never could I hope to meet with such another.
XXIX
""Two years were passed since to a distant town
He had repaired to ply a gainful trade:
What tears of bitter grief, till then unknown!
What tender vows, our last sad kiss delayed!
To him we turned:--we had no other aid:
Like one revived, upon his neck I wept;
And her whom he had loved in joy, he said,
He well could love in grief; his faith he kept;
And in a quiet home once more my father slept.
XXX
""We lived in peace and comfort; and were blest
With daily bread, by constant toil supplied.
Three lovely babes had lain upon my breast;
And often, viewing their sweet smiles, I sighed,
And knew not why. My happy father died,
When threatened war reduced the children's meal:
Thrice happy! that for him the grave could hide
The empty loom, cold hearth, and silent wheel,
And tears that flowed for ills which patience might not heal.
XXXI
""'Twas a hard change; an evil time was come;
We had no hope, and no relief could gain:
But soon, with proud parade, the noisy drum
Beat round to clear the streets of want and pain.
My husband's arms now only served to strain
Me and his children hungering in his view;
In such dismay my prayers and tears were vain:
To join those miserable men he flew,
And now to the sea-coast, with numbers more, we drew.
XXXII
""There were we long neglected, and we bore
Much sorrow ere the fleet its anchor weighed;
Green fields before us, and our native shore,
We breathed a pestilential air, that made
Ravage for which no knell was heard. We prayed
For our departure; wished and wished--nor knew,
'Mid that long sickness and those hopes delayed,
That happier days we never more must view.
The parting signal streamed--at last the land withdrew.
XXXIII
""But the calm summer season now was past.
On as we drove, the equinoctial deep
Ran mountains high before the howling blast,
And many perished in the whirlwind's sweep.
We gazed with terror on their gloomy sleep,
Untaught that soon such anguish must ensue,
Our hopes such harvest of affliction reap,
That we the mercy of the waves should rue:
We reached the western world, a poor devoted crew.
XXXIV
""The pains and plagues that on our heads came down,
Disease and famine, agony and fear,
In wood or wilderness, in camp or town,
It would unman the firmest heart to hear.
All perished--all in one remorseless year,
Husband and children! one by one, by sword
And ravenous plague, all perished: every tear
Dried up, despairing, desolate, on board
A British ship I waked, as from a trance restored.""
XXXV
Here paused she of all present thought forlorn,
Nor voice nor sound, that moment's pain expressed,
Yet Nature, with excess of grief o'erborne,
From her full eyes their watery load released.
He too was mute; and, ere her weeping ceased,
He rose, and to the ruin's portal went,
And saw the dawn opening the silvery east
With rays of promise, north and southward sent;
And soon with crimson fire kindled the firmament.
XXXVI
""O come,"" he cried, ""come, after weary night
Of such rough storm, this happy change to view.""
So forth she came, and eastward looked; the sight
Over her brow like dawn of gladness threw;
Upon her cheek, to which its youthful hue
Seemed to return, dried the last lingering tear,
And from her grateful heart a fresh one drew:
The whilst her comrade to her pensive cheer
Tempered fit words of hope; and the lark warbled near.
XXXVII
They looked and saw a lengthening road, and wain
That rang down a bare slope not far remote:
The barrows glistered bright with drops of rain,
Whistled the waggoner with merry note,
The cock far off sounded his clarion throat;
But town, or farm, or hamlet, none they viewed,
Only were told there stood a lonely cot
A long mile thence. While thither they pursued
Their way, the Woman thus her mournful tale renewed.
XXXVIII
""Peaceful as this immeasurable plain
Is now, by beams of dawning light imprest,
In the calm sunshine slept the glittering main;
The very ocean hath its hour of rest.
I too forgot the heavings of my breast.
How quiet 'round me ship and ocean were!
As quiet all within me. I was blest,
And looked, and fed upon the silent air
Until it seemed to bring a joy to my despair.
XXXIX
""Ah! how unlike those late terrific sleeps,
And groans that rage of racking famine spoke;
The unburied dead that lay in festering heaps,
The breathing pestilence that rose like smoke,
The shriek that from the distant battle broke,
The mine's dire earthquake, and the pallid host
Driven by the bomb's incessant thunderstroke
To loathsome vaults, where heart-sick anguish tossed,
Hope died, and fear itself in agony was lost!
XL
""Some mighty gulf of separation past,
I seemed transported to another world;
A thought resigned with pain, when from the mast
The impatient mariner the sail unfurled,
And, whistling, called the wind that hardly curled
The silent sea. From the sweet thoughts of home
And from all hope I was for ever hurled.
For me--farthest from earthly port to roam
Was best, could I but shun the spot where man might come.
XLI
""And oft I thought (my fancy was so strong)
That I, at last, a resting-place had found;
'Here will I dwell,' said I, 'my whole life long,
Roaming the illimitable waters round;
Here will I live, of all but heaven disowned,
And end my days upon the peaceful flood.'--
To break my dream the vessel reached its bound;
And homeless near a thousand homes I stood,
And near a thousand tables pined and wanted food.
XLII
""No help I sought; in sorrow turned adrift,
Was hopeless, as if cast on some bare rock;
Nor morsel to my mouth that day did lift,
Nor raised my hand at any door to knock.
I lay where, with his drowsy mates, the cock
From the cross-timber of an out-house hung:
Dismally tolled, that night, the city clock!
At morn my sick heart hunger scarcely stung,
Nor to the beggar's language could I fit my tongue.
XLIII
""So passed a second day; and, when the third
Was come, I tried in vain the crowd's resort.
--In deep despair, by frightful wishes stirred,
Near the sea-side I reached a ruined fort;
There, pains which nature could no more support,
With blindness linked, did on my vitals fall;
And, after many interruptions short
Of hideous sense, I sank, nor step could crawl:
Unsought for was the help that did my life recall.
XLIV
""Borne to a hospital, I lay with brain
Drowsy and weak, and shattered memory;
I heard my neighbours in their beds complain
Of many things which never troubled me--
Of feet still bustling round with busy glee,
Of looks where common kindness had no part,
Of service done with cold formality,
Fretting the fever round the languid heart,
And groans which, as they said, might make a dead man start.
XLV
""These things just served to stir the slumbering sense,
Nor pain nor pity in my bosom raised.
With strength did memory return; and, thence
Dismissed, again on open day I gazed,
At houses, men, and common light, amazed.
The lanes I sought, and, as the sun retired,
Came where beneath the trees a faggot blazed,
The travellers saw me weep, my fate inquired,
And gave me food--and rest, more welcome, more desired.
XLVI
""Rough potters seemed they, trading soberly
With panniered asses driven from door to door;
But life of happier sort set forth to me,
And other joys my fancy to allure--
The bag-pipe dinning on the midnight moor
In barn uplighted; and companions boon,
Well met from far with revelry secure
Among the forest glades, while jocund June
Rolled fast along the sky his warm and genial moon.
XLVII
""But ill they suited me--those journeys dark
O'er moor and mountain, midnight theft to hatch!
To charm the surly house-dog's faithful bark,
Or hang on tip-toe at the lifted latch.
The gloomy lantern, and the dim blue match,
The black disguise, the warning whistle shrill,
And ear still busy on its nightly watch,
Were not for me, brought up in nothing ill:
Besides, on griefs so fresh my thoughts were brooding still.
XLVIII
""What could I do, unaided and unblest?
My father! gone was every friend of thine:
And kindred of dead husband are at best
Small help; and, after marriage such as mine,
With little kindness would to me incline.
Nor was I then for toil or service fit;
My deep-drawn sighs no effort could confine;
In open air forgetful would I sit
Whole hours, with idle arms in moping sorrow knit.
XLIX
""The roads I paced, I loitered through the fields;
Contentedly, yet sometimes self-accused.
Trusted my life to what chance bounty yields,
Now coldly given, now utterly refused.
The ground I for my bed have often used:
But what afflicts my peace with keenest ruth,
Is that I have my inner self abused,
Foregone the home delight of constant truth,
And clear and open soul, so prized in fearless youth.
L
""Through tears the rising sun I oft have viewed,
Through tears have seen him towards that world descend
Where my poor heart lost all its fortitude:
Three years a wanderer now my course I bend--
Oh! tell me whither--for no earthly friend
Have I.""--She ceased, and weeping turned away;
As if because her tale was at an end,
She wept; because she had no more to say
Of that perpetual weight which on her spirit lay.
LI
True sympathy the Sailor's looks expressed,
His looks--for pondering he was mute the while.
Of social Order's care for wretchedness,
Of Time's sure help to calm and reconcile,
Joy's second spring and Hope's long-treasured smile,
'Twas not for 'him' to speak--a man so tried,
Yet, to relieve her heart, in friendly style
Proverbial words of comfort he applied,
And not in vain, while they went pacing side by side.
LII
Ere long, from heaps of turf, before their sight,
Together smoking in the sun's slant beam,
Rise various wreaths that into one unite
Which high and higher mounts with silver gleam:
Fair spectacle,---but instantly a scream
Thence bursting shrill did all remark prevent;
They paused, and heard a hoarser voice blaspheme,
And female cries. Their course they thither bent,
And met a man who foamed with anger vehement,
LIII
A woman stood with quivering lips and pale,
And, pointing to a little child that lay
Stretched on the ground, began a piteous tale;
How in a simple freak of thoughtless play
He had provoked his father, who straightway,
As if each blow were deadlier than the last,
Struck the poor innocent. Pallid with dismay
The Soldier's Widow heard and stood aghast;
And stern looks on the man her grey-haired Comrade cast.
LIV
His voice with indignation rising high
Such further deed in manhood's name forbade;
The peasant, wild in passion, made reply
With bitter insult and revilings sad;
Asked him in scorn what business there he had;
What kind of plunder he was hunting now;
The gallows would one day of him be glad;--
Though inward anguish damped the Sailor's brow,
Yet calm he seemed as thoughts so poignant would allow.
LV
Softly he stroked the child, who lay outstretched
With face to earth; and, as the boy turned round
His battered head, a groan the Sailor fetched
As if he saw--there and upon that ground--
Strange repetition of the deadly wound
He had himself inflicted. Through his brain
At once the griding iron passage found;
Deluge of tender thoughts then rushed amain,
Nor could his sunken eyes the starting tear restrain.
LVI
Within himself he said--What hearts have we!
The blessing this a father gives his child!
Yet happy thou, poor boy! compared with me,
Suffering not doing ill--fate far more mild.
The stranger's looks and tears of wrath beguiled
The father, and relenting thoughts awoke;
He kissed his son--so all was reconciled.
Then, with a voice which inward trouble broke
Ere to his lips it came, the Sailor them bespoke.
LVII
""Bad is the world, and hard is the world's law
Even for the man who wears the warmest fleece;
Much need have ye that time more closely draw
The bond of nature, all unkindness cease,
And that among so few there still be peace:
Else can ye hope but with such numerous foes
Your pains shall ever with your years increase?""--
While from his heart the appropriate lesson flows,
A correspondent calm stole gently o'er his woes.
LVIII
Forthwith the pair passed on; and down they look
Into a narrow valley's pleasant scene
Where wreaths of vapour tracked a winding brook,
That babbled on through groves and meadows green;
A low-roofed house peeped out the trees between;
The dripping groves resound with cheerful lays,
And melancholy lowings intervene
Of scattered herds, that in the meadow graze,
Some amid lingering shade, some touched by the sun's rays.
LIX
They saw and heard, and, winding with the road,
Down a thick wood, they dropt into the vale;
Comfort, by prouder mansions unbestowed,
Their wearied frames, she hoped, would soon regale.
Erelong they reached that cottage in the dale:
It was a rustic inn;--the board was spread,
The milk-maid followed with her brimming pail,
And lustily the master carved the bread,
Kindly the housewife pressed, and they in comfort fed.
LX
Their breakfast done, the pair, though loth, must part;
Wanderers whose course no longer now agrees.
She rose and bade farewell! and, while her heart
Struggled with tears nor could its sorrow ease,
She left him there; for, clustering round his knees,
With his oak-staff the cottage children played;
And soon she reached a spot o'erhung with trees
And banks of ragged earth; beneath the shade
Across the pebbly road a little runnel strayed.
LXI
A cart and horse beside the rivulet stood;
Chequering the canvas roof the sunbeams shone.
She saw the carman bend to scoop the flood
As the wain fronted her,--wherein lay one,
A pale-faced Woman, in disease far gone.
The carman wet her lips as well behoved;
Bed under her lean body there was none,
Though even to die near one she most had loved
She could not of herself those wasted limbs have moved.
LXII
The Soldier's Widow learned with honest pain
And homefelt force of sympathy sincere,
Why thus that worn-out wretch must there sustain
The jolting road and morning air severe.
The wain pursued its way; and following near
In pure compassion she her steps retraced
Far as the cottage. ""A sad sight is here,""
She cried aloud; and forth ran out in haste
The friends whom she had left but a few minutes past.
LXIII
While to the door with eager speed they ran,
From her bare straw the Woman half upraised
Her bony visage--gaunt and deadly wan;
No pity asking, on the group she gazed
With a dim eye, distracted and amazed;
Then sank upon her straw with feeble moan.
Fervently cried the housewife--""God be praised,
I have a house that I can call my own;
Nor shall she perish there, untended and alone!""
LXIV
So in they bear her to the chimney seat,
And busily, though yet with fear, untie
Her garments, and, to warm her icy feet
And chafe her temples, careful hands apply.
Nature reviving, with a deep-drawn sigh
She strove, and not in vain, her head to rear;
Then said--""I thank you all; if I must die,
The God in heaven my prayers for you will hear;
Till now I did not think my end had been so near.
LXV
""Barred every comfort labour could procure,
Suffering what no endurance could assuage,
I was compelled to seek my father's door,
Though loth to be a burthen on his age.
But sickness stopped me in an early stage
Of my sad journey; and within the wain
They placed me--there to end life's pilgrimage,
Unless beneath your roof I may remain;
For I shall never see my father's door again.
LXVI
""My life, Heaven knows, hath long been burthensome;
But, if I have not meekly suffered, meek
May my end be! Soon will this voice be dumb:
Should child of mine e'er wander hither, speak
Of me, say that the worm is on my cheek.--
Torn from our hut, that stood beside the sea
Near Portland lighthouse in a lonesome creek,
My husband served in sad captivity
On shipboard, bound till peace or death should set him free.
LXVII
""A sailor's wife I knew a widow's cares,
Yet two sweet little ones partook my bed;
Hope cheered my dreams, and to my daily prayers
Our heavenly Father granted each day's bread;
Till one was found by stroke of violence dead,
Whose body near our cottage chanced to lie;
A dire suspicion drove us from our shed;
In vain to find a friendly face we try,
Nor could we live together those poor boys and I;
LXVIII
""For evil tongues made oath how on that day
My husband lurked about the neighbourhood;
Now he had fled, and whither none could say,
And 'he' had done the deed in the dark wood--
Near his own home!--but he was mild and good;
Never on earth was gentler creature seen;
He'd not have robbed the raven of its food.
My husband's lovingkindness stood between
Me and all worldly harms and wrongs however keen.""
LXIX
Alas! the thing she told with labouring breath
The Sailor knew too well. That wickedness
His hand had wrought; and when, in the hour of death,
He saw his Wife's lips move his name to bless
With her last words, unable to suppress
His anguish, with his heart he ceased to strive;
And, weeping loud in this extreme distress,
He cried--""Do pity me! That thou shouldst live
I neither ask nor wish--forgive me, but forgive!""
LXX
To tell the change that Voice within her wrought
Nature by sign or sound made no essay;
A sudden joy surprised expiring thought,
And every mortal pang dissolved away.
Borne gently to a bed, in death she lay;
Yet still while over her the husband bent,
A look was in her face which seemed to say,
""Be blest; by sight of thee from heaven was sent
Peace to my parting soul, the fulness of content.""
LXXI
'She' slept in peace,--his pulses throbbed and stopped,
Breathless he gazed upon her face,--then took
Her hand in his, and raised it, but both dropped,
When on his own he cast a rueful look.
His ears were never silent; sleep forsook
His burning eyelids stretched and stiff as lead;
All night from time to time under him shook
The floor as he lay shuddering on his bed;
And oft he groaned aloud, ""O God, that I were dead!""
LXXII
The Soldier's Widow lingered in the cot,
And, when he rose, he thanked her pious care
Through which his Wife, to that kind shelter brought,
Died in his arms; and with those thanks a prayer
He breathed for her, and for that merciful pair.
The corse interred, not one hour heremained
Beneath their roof, but to the open air
A burthen, now with fortitude sustained,
He bore within a breast where dreadful quiet reigned.
LXXIII
Confirmed of purpose, fearlessly prepared
For act and suffering, to the city straight
He journeyed, and forthwith his crime declared:
""And from your doom,"" he added, ""now I wait,
Nor let it linger long, the murderer's fate.""
Not ineffectual was that piteous claim:
""O welcome sentence which will end though late,""
He said, ""the pangs that to my conscience came
Out of that deed. My trust, Saviour! is in thy name!""
LXXIV
His fate was pitied. Him in iron case
(Reader, forgive the intolerable thought)
They hung not:--no one on 'his' form or face
Could gaze, as on a show by idlers sought;
No kindred sufferer, to his death-place brought
By lawless curiosity or chance,
When into storm the evening sky is wrought,
Upon his swinging corse an eye can glance,
And drop, as he once dropped, in miserable trance."

Ah grief!
Thou twin tormentors
That   keep so close
To the heart
Even the marrow of the bone!
I wish thee farewell
And that thou wouldest flee, to the

So that I  can be free
To  love and to live again!"
147,Emotion,SorrowPoemsDaysWithoutSorrowPoembySilenceDogood,"Teardrops fall down my face.
The mistakes I cant replace.
The days I forgot,
The memories I lost.
And all because I was killed inside.
Poisoned by youre secrets like cyanide.
I lost myself forgot my friends.
Headed towards the dark end.
And I try but the harder I try,
the more I fail the more I lie.
And I have to beilive than I can go on.
Even when everything has turned out wrong.
I have to keep going in the hopes of tommorow.
Waiting for the day without any sorrow."
148,Emotion,SorrowPoemsHiddenSorrowOfAnUnknownTeenPoembyReganMeade,"I smile as the blood runs down my arm.
The blood is a mixture of mine and those who have,
betrayed my trust and heart.
I don't care if i die for my crimes,
to me it was all worth it in the end.
Now i know that no one will betray me again,
but if they do i will kill myself instead of them.
Maybe, just maybe, I'll rest in peace with no fear of
ever getting hurt again, but I know that's not true,
you never get peace.
There is no such thing in any life time.So now i know
why i'm here...
I'm one of those few poeple born into this world,
that are priveleged to be hurt, stabbed in the back,
betrayed, and most of all...unloved.
That day I ran out of tears, so now I smile.
I truly have no reason to.
But since my tears are forever dry.
I smile for its the only thing i can do."
149,Emotion,SorrowPoemsMyPainMySorrowPoembyAfzalHussain,"I am lucky
I have your love
I am blessed
I know you
But
It is so hurtful
And
So painful
That I can't feel and touch you"
150,Emotion,SorrowPoemsDayOfSorrowPoembyJazmineStaples,"A day of sorrow,
a day of pain,
Not knowing who's to blame?
Towers standing tall and true,
Destroyed by people with something to prove.
Millions cried and millions prayed,
To save one life the heroes slaved.
Clearing the rubble and mounds of debris,
With tears in their eyes, they worked fearlessly.
Stranges wept for the many and few,
Hoping God will pull them throught.
I walk throught the valley of the shadow of death;
The last words spoken before we laid them to rest.
I cry with people I do not know,
To see their pain it hurts me so.
Maybe one day our pain will end,
With love and support from family and friends."
151,Emotion,SorrowPoemsLegionsOfSorrowOfSummerDefineMePoembysjgoldner,"So I called Jamie
and Michael
and Zach.
After you didn't get back to me.
And then I couldn't sleep,
so I called Eric,
Tom and Bryan.
Because you didn't get back to me.
And I laid awake and counted the crickets'
chirps and thought about the nights
we had spent
in each other's arms-
The conversations over bottles of wine
and delicious, gourmet dinners;
six-packs, hoagies and pizza.
I loved you and I said it.
While you were moisturizing your
elbows and forearms.
I said I loved you and I meant it.
And you told me to `stop.'
To stop and breathe.   Is what you meant."
152,Emotion,SorrowPoemsJoyAndSorrowChapterViiiPoembyKhalilGibran,"Then a woman said, ""Speak to us of Joy and Sorrow.""
And he answered:
Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.
And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.
And how else can it be?
The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.
Is not the cup that hold your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter's oven?
And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives?
When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.
When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.
Some of you say, ""Joy is greater than sorrow,"" and others say, ""Nay, sorrow is the greater.""
But I say unto you, they are inseparable.
Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.
Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy.
Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced.
When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall."
153,Emotion,SorrowPoemsTheBulletsOfSorrowPoembyDrHiteshSheth,"The lethal bullets of sorrow
Aim at our rosy morrows,
By the cruel devilish FATE,
Push the men through sadness gate.
Cruel death is a helping mate,
Eager to share his blood -filled plate.
The bullet targets our jobs,
Pellet pierces our hopes.
The shrapnel shatters our ties,
The smoke smothers our sighs.
Battered love cries, and dashed dream sobs,
And lo! frail heart quivers to cope.
Some sheds tear dry, some sheds wet,
Blaming tight-lipped heavenly gate.
Some hides their pain in joyous muse,
Some reveals it in word obtuse.
No one is immune to attacks,
Save men trudging on divine tracks.

154,Emotion,SorrowPoemsJoyAndSorrowPoembyFrancisDuggan,"One can hear the voice of sorrow sobbing, sobbing endlessly
Yet it hides in dark recesses sorrow you can never see
It's a black and brooding creature with a voice that aches of pain
And all of those who have met with it hope not to meet with it again.
Joy is always bright and breezy joy has got a laughing face
And where ever joy is present you will find a happy place
Joy is loved by everybody the scars of grief it can repair
It is such a happy creature joy is welcome everywhere.
There is not one who likes sorrow you will not hear some one say
I've met with sorrow this morning and meeting it has made my day
At the mention of the name of sorrow people pretend not to hear
But joy always bright and happy greets you with a lusty cheer.
Sorrow it is dark and tearful and it hides in a dark and lonely place
But joy is always bright and cheerful and it greets you with a laughing face
And everybody hates old sorrow as it always gives rise to woe
But joy the happiest of the happy the one all people wish to know."
155,Emotion,SorrowPoemsSorrowAndPainFromRhythmicon50LeadSheetsWithPoemsPoembyPeterSQuinn,"There's sorrow and pain
Wherever we want to go,
We search thoroughly in vain
To prosper and grow;
What will become of this
For nothing is too far fetched,
Onward thought a mere wish
Bleaked out and stretched.
Gray clouds in much rain
The days too lost to know,
A turning wheel ah here again
Something that's a while ago;
Too many things it then is
Through with past time etched,
One of those little reminisce
Unimportant and outstretched.
There's sorrow and pain
In the house down the row,
Ordinary life and strain
TV taboos and scarecrow;
All we cannot ordinarily dismiss
Brought to mind and sketched,
With dissatisfaction and hiss
The many things we retched."
156,Emotion,SorrowPoemsSorrowPoembyBJAyers,"Challenges in life, The ups and downs,
It’s all part of life, both smiles and frowns,
Like a Ferris wheel, you’re up then down.
You wish to hide, or maybe leave town,
Reality is real; we all face the fear,
We smile with joy; we all shed a tear,
Life can be lonely, when no one is near,
We often think, we’re not welcome here.
The sorrow we feel, that others can’t see,
A desire for help, we wish to plea,
A sense of loneliness, A desire to flee,
You’re not alone, both you and me,
Friends are waiting, with the comfort we need,
They are waiting; their hearts also bleed,
One small gesture, just one small seed,
Is all that’s required, for a friend to proceed,
To listen and comfort, for someone like you,
They want to help. They have been there too,
We’re not by ourselves, when life is so blue,
Someone can help, with the pain we go  through,"

158,Emotion,SorrowPoemsSadnessAndSorrowPoembyMiaPeterson,"Its just a small story
And I feel the need to say it
I just couldn't take it anymore
The pain he was causing me
It was just too much for me to bare
It was only that night
Which I realized that I had to do it
I gave you a text message
Apologizing, but in the same time
Telling you that I had to be strong
And forget you
It was over
I never worried about my past or future
And you were my past
That was the only thing
Which was clear to me
Suddenly you call me
Asking for an explanation
I told you it was too much for me to put up with
You did your best to apologize
But it was all in vain
There was no time for another try
Although a big future was awaiting the both of us
You still tried to apologize
But I was too stubborn to try once more
All I did was close my phone
And go to bed
Hoping that till tomorrow I would have forgotten you
I feel asleep very fast
Because all the tears I cried had finally made their effect
The next morning I woke up happily
As I turned my phone on I was ready to call you
But then I just froze there
Doing absolutely nothing
Remembering I could no longer be with you
I went to our special place
Next to the pink lake
Under our blossom tree
But I saw someone was already there
It was you
I started quivering
You turn around to me and fake a smile
But even his fake smile soon faded away
Apologizing once more
With little hope in your heart
A tear runs down my face
And I run to you
You open your arms widely
Patiently waiting for me
To throw myself in them
It was exactly what I did
You tell me you're never going to do any mistake
Never again in your life
I tell you that I just can't live without you
It was that night
I realized how much I love you
How much I care for you
How I'm addicted to you
You're like a drug for me
And I'll never check in a rehab
With such a satisfactory drug
Like the one which is on my mind right now
That drug is you
Now we just go on with our lives
Being there for each other
With no fake smiles
With no secrets
Only with a flame in both our hearts
A flame which will burn forever"

Swift to the spoil;
The lion will eat straw like the ox.
A tumultuous noise,
The bricks have fallen  down;
Light and joy,
Darkness and sorrow,
The wolf will dwell with the lamb;
To the brook of the willows like,
The Sycamore Tree that are cut down.
Love is as strong as death,
Jealousy is as cruel as the grave;
Listen to my muse oh Earth!
As white as snow,
To shave with a hired razor;
As slow as the tortoise,
The leopard will lie down with the goat;
In a barren night like a stillborn child where,
The teeth of the young lions are broken;
Darkness and sorrow,
Love is as strong as death itself."

Rest, if rest might haply deliver
Sorrow.
One thought lies close in her heart gnawn thorough
With pain, a weed in a dried-up river,
A rust-red share in an empty furrow.
Hearts that strain at her chain would sever
The link where yesterday frets to-morrow:
All things pass in the world, but never

That one thought will exist no longer,
That horrible thought of death.

echoing in the valley of wind,

an abyss of oblivion for
those who dwell among the trees.

Echoing in my heart
Pricking my conscience

We all grieve on your fate
But never raised a finger
I can see you stretched on a dingy cot
Your house dilapidated
Your hair undone spreading
Your tears dry
I see your bare neck
Still bearing red with finger prints
Your lips dry with fear
Oh mother your eye lashes wide with fear
Your deep blue eyes move round and round
The nightmare you had had multiple
The pain of life written all over your face
I can imagine all what you have gone through
Your children weep pulling yr skirt
Your torn skirt
Your body smelling sweat and saliva
Of those soldiers
Your breasts bear the stench of their beret
Your veil was hung on the wall stained in blood
Shaming the humanity
I see your children sucking from your dried breasts
Crying for little milk
Poor things they never had a decent meal for a long long time
Oh poor babies
We hear they cry waking you up
But you are tired
In fatigue
Oh my mother now they are bargaining your flesh
The shopkeepers and the Yankees
They want to trade your flesh
Your pride
Your chastity Your righteousness
Your dignity
Oh mother I weep for you
Let my tears mingle with blood flowing
_ in Euphretis and Tigris
I cry louder and louder
Until someone hears……

165,Emotion,SorrowPoemsSorrowPoembyLiChingChao,"To the melody of ""Sheng Sheng Man""
I pine and peak
And questless seek
Groping and moping to linger and languish
Anon to wander and wonder, glare, stare and start
Flesh chill'd
Ghost thrilled
With grim dart
And keen canker of rankling anguish.
Sudden a gleam
Of fair weather felt
But fled as fast -- and the ice-cold season stays.
How hard to have these days
In rest or respite, peace or truce.
Sip upon sip of tasteless wine
Is of slight use
To counter or quell
The fierce lash of the evening blast.
The wild geese -- see --
Fly overhead
Ah, there's the grief
That's chief -- grief beyond bearing,
Wild fowl far faring
In days of old you sped
Bearing my true love's tender thoughts to me.
Lo, how my lawn is rife with golden blooms
Of bunched chrysanthemums --
Weary their heads they bow.
Who cares to pluck them now?
While I the casement keep
Lone, waiting, waiting for night
And, as the shades fall
Upon broad leaves, sparse rain-drops drip.
Ah, such a plight
Of grief -- grief unbearable, unthinkable."
166,Emotion,SorrowPoemsLaysOfSorrowPoembyLewisCarroll,"The day was wet, the rain fell souse
Like jars of strawberry jam,  a
sound was heard in the old henhouse,
A beating of a hammer.
Of stalwart form, and visage warm,
Two youths were seen within it,
Splitting up an old tree into perches for their poultry
At a hundred strokes  a minute.
The work is done, the hen has taken
Possession of her nest and eggs,
Without a thought of eggs and bacon,
(Or I am very much mistaken happy)
She turns over each shell,
To be sure that all's well,
Looks into the straw
To see there's no flaw,
Goes once round the house,
Half afraid of a mouse,
Then sinks calmly to rest
On the top of her nest,
First doubling up each of her legs.
Time rolled away, and so did every shell,
'Small by degrees and beautifully less,'
As the large mother with a powerful spell
Forced each in turn its contents to express,
But ah! 'imperfect is expression,'
Some poet said, I don't care who,
If you want to know you must go elsewhere,
One fact I can tell, if you're willing to hear,
He never attended a Parliament Session,
For I'm certain that if he had ever been there,
Full quickly would he have changed his ideas,
With the hissings, the hootings, the groans and the cheers.
And as to his name it is pretty clear
That it wasn't me and it wasn't you!
And so it fell upon a day,
(That is, it never rose again)
A chick was found upon the hay,
Its little life had ebbed away.
No longer frolicsome and gay,
No longer could it run or play.
'And must we, chicken, must we part? '
Its master [7] cried with bursting heart,
And voice of agony and pain.
So one, whose ticket's marked 'Return', [8]
When to the lonely roadside station
He flies in fear and perturbation,
Thinks of his home- the hissing urn-
Then runs with flying hat and hair,
And, entering, finds to his despair
He's missed the very last train. [9]
Too long it were to tell of each conjecture
Of chicken suicide, and poultry victim,
The deadly frown, the stern and dreary lecture,
The timid guess, 'perhaps some needle pricked him! '
The din of voice, the words both loud and many,
The sob, the tear, the sigh that none could smother,
Till all agreed 'a shilling to a penny
It killed itself, and we acquit the mother! '
Scarce was the verdict spoken,
When that still calm was broken,
A childish form hath burst into the throng;
With tears and looks of sadness,
That bring no news of gladness,
But tell too surely something hath gone wrong!
'The sight I have come upon
The stoutest heart [10] would sicken,
That nasty hen has been and gone
And killed another chicken! '"

168,Emotion,SorrowPoemsbarrenWallsOfSorrowPoembyBonnieCollins,"Tides came and washed away
the empitiness inside my vacant
heart, the waves came with a thrash
and washed all the remains only leaving
a lonley piece of driftwood, withered
and set alone to endure its helpless
future for someone's raging fire
Listening to the gulls, screeching in
harmony of knowing the tides were
very high with huge changes in store,
I walked along the beach that fatefull
day and wondered, which way to follow
As night set in, calmly now, the sea
once again was thrashing to and fro
and leaving behind the tity bed of
new sand with the moon casting its
lonely shadow, it told me then, the
sand is new, and now is the time
for a new start in my life leaving behind
the battered hinges on the door to my
forsaken heart, but letting the oppourtunity
to replace its barren walls of sorrow......"
169,Emotion,SorrowPoemsPartingIsSuchDeepSorrowPoembyLesaMRK,"I still remember the soft touch of your hand,
As I stand here lonely in this foreign land.
And can you remember how I loved you?
Does love still glow in those eyes of blue?
Sing me that song those birds sang long ago.
Hold me close in those arms and never let me go.
Don't say you are leaving as you have done before.
Say we will be together today and forevermore....
Let's walk together and talk of what has been done,
And then go for a swim in the bright sun.
As I get the feeling the time is drawing near,
I will hug you to me and cry a sorrowed tear.
The memories were special, for now they are gone,
But I still recall each one with every rising dawn.
One last goodbye, parting forevermore.
One last kiss, more feverish than before.
I cherish our  love,
It's tender, sweet song.
And hope in my heart,
This parting won't be long."
170,Emotion,SorrowPoemsWhoWalkedWithSorrowPoembyWillBarber,"There was a man who walked with Sorrow
As though Sorrow were his love,
And he seemed to court her gently;
He was very well-behaved.
So, Sorrow came to live with him
In the twilight of his youth;
In the evenings she would hold him
Till he could not breathe.
'Sorrow, Sorrow, ' said he,
'This love is worth than life.'
Then he turned on the TV,
And surfed the violet wave."
171,Emotion,SorrowPoemsSorrowPoembyMariahWhitfield,"sorrow can leave you spending in a frame
with so much gulit and pain
sorrow was  taken as a game
but it's so much more than and emotion
it's a pain
love brings sorrow in the game
it's like a pain calling your name
sometimes that come and never goes away
sorrow is based on a fear
sorrow is a secret you hold near
sorrow can hurt based on if it's a fear
but thats basically why sorrow found you here"
172,Emotion,SorrowPoemsSongOfUnendingSorrowPoembyBaiJuyi,"China's Emperor, craving beauty that might shake an empire,
Was on the throne for many years, searching, never finding,
Till a little child of the Yang clan, hardly even grown,
Bred in an inner chamber, with no one knowing her,
But with graces granted by heaven and not to be concealed,
At last one day was chosen for the imperial household.
If she but turned her head and smiled, there were cast a hundred spells,
And the powder and paint of the Six Palaces faded into nothing.
...It was early spring. They bathed her in the FlowerPure Pool,
Which warmed and smoothed the creamy-tinted crystal of her skin,
And, because of her languor, a maid was lifting her
When first the Emperor noticed her and chose her for his bride.
The cloud of her hair, petal of her cheek, gold ripples of her crown when she moved,
Were sheltered on spring evenings by warm hibiscus curtains;
But nights of spring were short and the sun arose too soon,
And the Emperor, from that time forth, forsook his early hearings
And lavished all his time on her with feasts and revelry,
His mistress of the spring, his despot of the night.
There were other ladies in his court, three thousand of rare beauty,
But his favours to three thousand were concentered in one body.
By the time she was dressed in her Golden Chamber, it would be almost evening;
And when tables were cleared in the Tower of Jade, she would loiter, slow with wine.
Her sisters and her brothers all were given titles;
And, because she so illumined and glorified her clan,
She brought to every father, every mother through the empire,
Happiness when a girl was born rather than a boy.
...High rose Li Palace, entering blue clouds,
And far and wide the breezes carried magical notes
Of soft song and slow dance, of string and bamboo music.
The Emperor's eyes could never gaze on her enough-
Till war-drums, booming from Yuyang, shocked the whole earth
And broke the tunes of The Rainbow Skirt and the Feathered Coat.
The Forbidden City, the nine-tiered palace, loomed in the dust
From thousands of horses and chariots headed southwest.
The imperial flag opened the way, now moving and now pausing- -
But thirty miles from the capital, beyond the western gate,
The men of the army stopped, not one of them would stir
Till under their horses' hoofs they might trample those moth- eyebrows....
Flowery hairpins fell to the ground, no one picked them up,
And a green and white jade hair-tassel and a yellowgold hair- bird.
The Emperor could not save her, he could only cover his face.
And later when he turned to look, the place of blood and tears
Was hidden in a yellow dust blown by a cold wind.
... At the cleft of the Dagger-Tower Trail they crisscrossed through a cloud-line
Under Omei Mountain. The last few came.
Flags and banners lost their colour in the fading sunlight....
But as waters of Shu are always green and its mountains always blue,
So changeless was His Majesty's love and deeper than the days.
He stared at the desolate moon from his temporary palace.
He heard bell-notes in the evening rain, cutting at his breast.
And when heaven and earth resumed their round and the dragon car faced home,
The Emperor clung to the spot and would not turn away
From the soil along the Mawei slope, under which was buried
That memory, that anguish. Where was her jade-white face?
Ruler and lords, when eyes would meet, wept upon their coats
As they rode, with loose rein, slowly eastward, back to the capital.
...The pools, the gardens, the palace, all were just as before,
The Lake Taiye hibiscus, the Weiyang Palace willows;
But a petal was like her face and a willow-leaf her eyebrow --
And what could he do but cry whenever he looked at them?
...Peach-trees and plum-trees blossomed, in the winds of spring;
Lakka-foliage fell to the ground, after autumn rains;
The Western and Southern Palaces were littered with late grasses,
And the steps were mounded with red leaves that no one swept away.
Her Pear-Garden Players became white-haired
And the eunuchs thin-eyebrowed in her Court of PepperTrees;
Over the throne flew fire-flies, while he brooded in the twilight.
He would lengthen the lamp-wick to its end and still could never sleep.
Bell and drum would slowly toll the dragging nighthours
And the River of Stars grow sharp in the sky, just before dawn,
And the porcelain mandarin-ducks on the roof grow thick with morning frost
And his covers of kingfisher-blue feel lonelier and colder
With the distance between life and death year after year;
And yet no beloved spirit ever visited his dreams.
...At Lingqiong lived a Taoist priest who was a guest of heaven,
Able to summon spirits by his concentrated mind.
And people were so moved by the Emperor's constant brooding
That they besought the Taoist priest to see if he could find her.
He opened his way in space and clove the ether like lightning,
Up to heaven, under the earth, looking everywhere.
Above, he searched the Green Void, below, the Yellow Spring;
But he failed, in either place, to find the one he looked for.
And then he heard accounts of an enchanted isle at sea,
A part of the intangible and incorporeal world,
With pavilions and fine towers in the five-coloured air,
And of exquisite immortals moving to and fro,
And of one among them-whom they called The Ever True-
With a face of snow and flowers resembling hers he sought.
So he went to the West Hall's gate of gold and knocked at the jasper door
And asked a girl, called Morsel-of-Jade, to tell The Doubly- Perfect.
And the lady, at news of an envoy from the Emperor of China,
Was startled out of dreams in her nine-flowered, canopy.
She pushed aside her pillow, dressed, shook away sleep,
And opened the pearly shade and then the silver screen.
Her cloudy hair-dress hung on one side because of her great haste,
And her flower-cap was loose when she came along the terrace,
While a light wind filled her cloak and fluttered with her motion
As though she danced The Rainbow Skirt and the Feathered Coat.
And the tear-drops drifting down her sad white face
Were like a rain in spring on the blossom of the pear.
But love glowed deep within her eyes when she bade him thank her liege,
Whose form and voice had been strange to her ever since their parting --
Since happiness had ended at the Court of the Bright Sun,
And moons and dawns had become long in Fairy-Mountain Palace.
But when she turned her face and looked down toward the earth
And tried to see the capital, there were only fog and dust.
So she took out, with emotion, the pledges he had given
And, through his envoy, sent him back a shell box and gold hairpin,
But kept one branch of the hairpin and one side of the box,
Breaking the gold of the hairpin, breaking the shell of the box;
""Our souls belong together,"" she said, "" like this gold and this shell --
Somewhere, sometime, on earth or in heaven, we shall surely
And she sent him, by his messenger, a sentence reminding him
Of vows which had been known only to their two hearts:
""On the seventh day of the Seventh-month, in the Palace of Long Life,
We told each other secretly in the quiet midnight world
That we wished to fly in heaven, two birds with the wings of one,
And to grow together on the earth, two branches of one tree.""
Earth endures, heaven endures; some time both shall end,
While this unending sorrow goes on and on for ever."
173,Emotion,SorrowPoemsWhatSorrowHasBefallenMePoembyANDREWBLAKEMORE,"What sorrow has befallen me
No sun to light my day,
These clouds yield only misery
While joy has fled away,
Across the lands where no one goes
And all do fear to tread,
Where only fear and silence grows
And dreams are lying dead.
Now waves of sadness and despair
Do swamp my aching heart,
For no one now does seem to care
My life's been torn apart,
Regrets I shall take to my grave
My tears forever flow,
For all my hopes I could not save
And on the winds did blow.
And yet no malice do I keep
Nor hate towards my love,
I'll dream of her within my sleep
While stars do shine above,
And hope that soon the dawn shall break
Then shine just like before,
For now I know each morn I wake
I'll miss her even more."

175,Emotion,SorrowPoemsJoyAndSorrowPoembyJohannWolfgangvonGoethe,"As a fisher-boy I fared
To the black rock in the sea,
And, while false gifts I prepared.
Listen'd and sang merrily,
Down descended the decoy,
Soon a fish attack'd the bait;
One exultant shout of joy,--
And the fish was captured straight.
Ah! on shore, and to the wood
Past the cliffs, o'er stock and stone,
One foot's traces I pursued,
And the maiden was alone.
Lips were silent, eyes downcast
As a clasp-knife snaps the bait,
With her snare she seized me fast,
And the boy was captured straight.
Heav'n knows who's the happy swain
That she rambles with anew!
I must dare the sea again,
Spite of wind and weather too.
When the great and little fish
Wail and flounder in my net,
Straight returns my eager wish
In her arms to revel yet!"
176,Emotion,SorrowPoemsflingsOfSorrowPoembyDrsubhendukar,"yet I do remember the hoary stance of night
rolling spumes away into onshore
to heap of sands yet not unknown
history yet records reels of fire.
where are those tiding whelms from hide
speckles ocean pierce into air unfailing
whispering dew of roses basking in glow
moon seemingly snored in valley of obscurity
mystery may uncover the flings of sorrow
night when chilled being chiseled of snow
do we ever know the eternity by reality?
rainbow is ephemeral by voyage to void"
177,Emotion,SorrowPoemsjoyAndSorrowPoembyDrsubhendukar,"joy and sorrow resolute within and beyond
night seems to lie in deep sleep
speckles of darkness covers her body
i close my eyes by the bliss of love
tonight tolls cry of innocence
as we look back through lone silence
audacity of hope resigns to repose
rain was running in deep breath
earth clenches mirth into riff of dusts
thirst dissolute melting the shadow
would you not comeback to fold of tonight
moments still remembers tinge of snow"
178,Emotion,SorrowPoemsRiverOfSorrowPoembySamanthaGuinen,"Rivers are like the life we share,
Sometimes we go fast,
Sometimes we go slow,
My river is slow and filled with sorrow,
It seems endless,
Never turns and always follows the same path,
Far from anyone or any place,
Alone my river stands and alone it shall stay,
The sorrowful river with a path so untold,
Will my river of sorrow ever cross paths with one other,"
179,Emotion,SorrowPoemsThoughTheLastGlimpseOfErinWithSorrowISeePoembyThomasMoore,"Though the last glimpse of Erin with sorrow I see,
Yet wherever thou art shall seem Erin to me;
In exile thy bosom shall still be my home,
And thine eyes make my climate wherever we roam.
To the gloom of some desert or cold rocky shore,
Where the eye of the stranger can haunt us no more,
I will fly with my Coulin, and think the rough wind
Less rude than the foes we leave frowning behind.
And I'll gaze on thy gold hair as graceful it wreathes,
And hang o'er thy soft harp, as wildly it breathes;
Nor dread that the cold-hearted Saxon will tear
One chord from that harp, or one lock from that hair."
180,Emotion,SorrowPoemsUnseenSorrowPoembyBobbySands,"Her tears fall in the darkness as the rain falls in the night,
Silvery tears like silvery rain, hidden out of sight,
The stars fall from her eyes like floating petals from the sky,
Is there no one in all this world who hears this woman cry?
A simple little floating dreamy thought has stired this womans heart,
The golden sleepy dream of yesterdays before they were apart,
What comfort can there be found for a petal so fair and slim
Alone in a forest dark of sorrow she weeps again for him?
Warm silver rolling tears blemish a once complexion fair,
That once shown in the fairest radiance midst a cloak of golden hair.
And the children whimper and cry for a father's care
and love they've never known,
Who sees their little tears of innocent years
as the winds of time are blown?
What sorrow will you know tonight
when all the worlds asleep,
When through the darkness comes the wind
that cuts the heart so deep,
For there is no one there to dry your tears
or your childrens tears who cling around your frock,
When there has been another bloody slaughter
in the dungeons of H Block.
BOBBY SANDS was twenty seven years old when he died on the sixty sixth day of hunger-strike in the H-Block prison hospital, Long Kesh, on the 5th May 1981. The young IRA Volunteer who had spent almost the last nine years of his short life in prison as a result of his Irish republican activities was, by the time of his death, world-famous having been elected to the british parliament and having withstood pressures, political and moral (including an emissary from Pope John Paul II) , for him to abandon his fast which was aimed at countering a criminalisation policy by the british government. His name became a household word in Ireland, and his sacrifice (as did that of those who followed him)  overturned british propaganda on Ireland and had a real effect in advancing the cause of Irish freedom."

Your expected departure
Cuts me to the quick
Survival is uncertain
Without you to protect my heart
I've both loved and hated you
For being my source
Of pleasure and pain
But I never wanted
To be without you
Not for an instant
Our life together is over
And painful as the thought may be
I know our parting
Is for the best
What more can I say except
Good-bye my lovely
Lily-white breast"
182,Emotion,SorrowPoemsSorrowPoembyDanielleNoguet,"Remember when lives were lost
You sleep and there is sorrow
Sorrow is when you’re awake.
Sorrow is the feeling you wish was fake
Sorrow is like your skin always attached to you.
Sorrow is like a tree sometimes you don't even pay attention to it, it's just there.
It is the feeling, which makes you, feels like your sad or it's unfair.
But you can't live without sorrow.
Just like you can't live without love.
Sorrow might even be the key to love"

186,Emotion,SorrowPoemsAsWeBaskInSorrowPoembykamrynchew,"While recently having a conversation with a friend, we discussed 'basking in sorrow, ' which by definition, is an oxymoron.. bask meaning to take great pleasure or satisfaction; and sorrow meaning loss or despair.
It is possible to bask in sorrow. While for one reason or another, sadness consumes you, at the same time you could be quite happy. For example; I am naturally a happy person. Therefor  while I may feel constant sadness about a certain situation,  I may still be basking; or somewhat happy. (smiling, laughing, having a good time)
Many people have a sadness inside them that is hidden, or  in the back of their mind at all times. These people are probably happy, can have fun, and seem to be in good cheer, while the sadness is still there, in their minds or hearts.
Therefor; we bask in sorrow.
Here we sit and bask in sorrow
Secretly begging for the morrow
A smile upon the outside face
Strength that shows as we run our race
Happiness is never too far away
Genuine cheer throughout the day
But a certain sadness wears us down
And being alone makes us frown
For this is what causes our heartache and grief
It hides under smiles, the sly little thief
So though we are basking in our sorrow today
We might soon find something to keep it at bay"
187,Emotion,SorrowPoemsBareEyesCrackWithSorrowPoembySandraFowler,"The bare eyes of old houses crack with sorrow,

Their shadows painted filigree on weather.
Gazing steadfastly upward beyond dying,
They memorize whatever birds are flying."
188,Emotion,SorrowPoemsSorrowAndDespairPoembyCieraIvey,"The pain crashes to the depth of my soul
Just another feeling of sorrow
Another flinch from pain
Just like yesterday, it'll be there tomorrow
Wounds healing slowly
So slow, it seems not at all
I want it gone tonight
But still and fast I fall
Where does it go from here?
Does it end?
Will it continue?
When did it begin?
But you don't care, do you?
I don't know why I even bother
You will never be what I need
Why should you try now to be the father?
Are you done hurting me?
Are you finished yet?
You enjoy it, don't you?
You have not one regret.
You took away my pride,
My joy, and my brother.
You avoided talking of things I needed to hear
Such as my mother
I just needed you
The love of a father
But I don't want it anymore because
I was never your daughter."

I am silenced by sorrow.
Questions go unspoken.
Answers remain unknown.
Fearing the brutality
of the darkness
I hide.
If I refuse to look too closely
will this still be true tomorrow?
Will you still have suffered
as you did?
Could I plunge
my hand of friendship
through the tar-like darkness
of your world
to bring you light?
Can you see the way out
or must I light a thousand candles
to ignite that part of you
that believes life can be wonderful?
With the first strike of the match....
I offer you a glimmer of hope.
I'll start lighting those candles now
and I won't stop until you see it.

My dreams are long and dark,
I can hear the sond but never see the color,
My dreams leave me awake some nights thinking,
Some dreams are more of a story,
But all have sarrow and pure sadness,
The trees are dead im the last alive,
All my dreams end the same,
A rock and a bang,
The rock is the earth,
More sorrow then the night before,
My dreams are deep and make me wright things like this,
The more i dream the more i cry,
The more i cry the more i think about my own death,
Will a die at 90 of age or 15 from a gun,
Will the killing ever stop,
Will we ever know how the world ends,
My dreams paint a dark and stormy picture,
My poems paint a clear,
My mind crys of dark things like this,
My hart crys harder and harder,
Between sweet and sour,
I think the end will end sour,
Are we to end in fire or ice,
You chose i would rather end in ice,"

Having failed miserably,

that sorrow makes honey taste sweeter still."
193,Emotion,SorrowPoemsAnguishPainMiserySorrowAndRetributionPoembytinashesevera,"Some say life is full of anguish,
old man once sang that life is full of pain
some even preach that life comes fully laced with misery and sorrow,
and some believe that life offers no retribution
ideas clearly instilled in the hearts and souls of many a man,
but the truth of the matter is,
life is anguish,
life is pain,
life is misery and sorrow,
in the same way as rain is water
and water is rain
for where can one get one`s own share of anguish,
who`d we ever have known pain if we never had life
without life, would we live through misery and sorrow
life in itself is retribution,
for he who has life can stand ground against
anguish, pain, misery and sorrow
and live to see brighter days seemingly unscathed
but woo to he who loses his life
in anguish, or pain, or misery , or sorrow
for he will receive no further retribution
and he will depart this earth with nothing but
anguish, pain, misery, sorrow
and retribution lost"

Floating up from the forgotten
Cigarette between my fingers,
Why does it trouble me?
Ah, you will understand;
When I carried my mother downstairs,
A few times only, at the beginning
Of her soft-foot malady,
I should find, for a reprimand
To my gaiety, a few long grey hairs
On the breast of my coat; and one by one
I let them float up the dark chimney."
196,Emotion,SorrowPoemsTheSorrowOfLovePoembyWilliamButlerYeats,"THE brawling of a sparrow in the eaves,
The brilliant moon and all the milky sky,
And all that famous harmony of leaves,
Had blotted out man's image and his cry.
A girl arose that had red mournful lips
And seemed the greatness of the world in tears,
Doomed like Odysseus and the labouring ships
And proud as Priam murdered with his peers;
Arose, and on the instant clamorous eaves,
A climbing moon upon an empty sky,
And all that lamentation of the leaves,
Could but compose man's image and his cry."

Bound and weary, I thought best
To sulk upon my mother's breast."

The words when i first heard of the sadness in my life
But i do not budge for i am strong
I walk past all who offer me a kind word to help ease my soul
I decline for I let my strength shine through
Acceptance within my heart I say i am all right
Everyone watches as i walk past and comment on my strength
Some fear that i have no feelings others envy for they hurt so much
I walk through the door of my bedroom and shut it behind me
I fall to my knees and catch myself with my hands as the tears stain the floor
My strength is gone and now my sorrrow envelopes me
My sight is blurred as the pure rain falls from my cheeks
I can not breathe as I realize what happened

alone again, like me
I greet you then I bless myself
and hope that I shall see
your lady busy in the trees
up here in Jagger Green.
The wind is soft and urgent
on the pale green Yorkshire hills
rooks fuss in high bare branches
looking down on silent mills
and the magpie is a single bird
up here in Jagger Green.
I watched him as he rested
in the Mayday morning light
then hard and low and straight there came
another flash of black and white
and the sun is like a woman's kiss
up here in Jagger Green."
200,Emotion,GreedPoemsWithGreedPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"I established lead
But failed to read
What was actual need?
To cater friends and feed
I got simple answer
The key lies with fewer
It is sweet coated offer
With clear aim to differ
I am number one greedy person
I make relation for selfish reasons
Greed is rampant in mind
So I act very kind
Greed shall pay dividend
And bring happy end
But I am mistaken
The peace, in turn, shall be mistaken
I shall die as unhappy man
Considered not fit to be human
It shall or should remain endeavor
I shall die hungry but not with greed or dishonor"
201,Emotion,GreedPoemsGreedPoembyInwalkedBud,"The world's wrapped up in politics and loves big finance too
I find it quite depressing in large quantities, it's true
It's good to have the knowledge, and to know what's going on
But when it starts to rule the world, then everything goes wrong
There's so much hate out in this world, It's such a crying shame
People pointing fingers and so quick to place the blame
Intolerant of others, and unwilling to diffuse
With sociopaths in charge, war is always in the news
I wish that we could coexist, respect our fellow man
Quit hating other ways of life that we don't understand
But in politics and finance, war profiteering, grows and thrives
Yes, it's all about the money, not at all about the lives
I am not apathetic, I just can't stand it any more
I do not wish to witness so much suffering and war
If I focus on the travesty of all thats going down
I can not breathe, I suffocate, my spirit starts to drown"
202,Emotion,GreedPoemsGreedPoembyBabatundeAremu,"Greed is a twin of graveyard
Its never says enough
Never ever filled to the brim
Its never contented
Greed is voluptuous
Always quest for self alone
Like vultures haunting for caracass
Greed is restless for more
Ever tight-fisted
Ever wanting to amass more
Till it becomes bloated
With materials unneedful
Always seeking vanity
Until its labour is naught"

Saturday,28th September 2019
What makes them bloodthirsty?
when they try to spread the hegemony
over the poor country
and manage control over the economy
nothing works
when greed exceeds
national interest is compromised
nothing goes as promised
it is a mad arms race
and worst scene if faced
innocent lives are put at stake
no one is in position to apply the brake
the world may face another risk
upon receiving the kick
in the form of threats
and it shall turn into the war theatre
no one has to cry
only humanity has to be given a try
the precious lives are to be saved
and the world community has to sensibly behave

205,Emotion,GreedPoemsTheManWhoseRichesSatisfyHisGreedPoembySolon,"The man whose riches satisfy his greed
Is not more rich for all those heaps and hoards
Than some poor man who has enough to feed
And clothe his corpse with such as God affords.
I have no use for men who steal and cheat;
The fruit of evil poisons those who eat.
Some wicked men are rich, some good men poor,
But I would rather trust in what's secure;
Our virtue sticks with us and makes us strong,
But money changes owners all day long."

207,Emotion,GreedPoemsAhimsa10TheCarnalGreedPoembyDrGeetaRadhakrishnaMenon,"Greediness for sensual pleasures -
Most obnoxious and low!
A man becomes a brute
When he follows
His base, animal instinct!
He chases the evil which secretly resides
Within himself!
He knows no better
Than his treacherous passions
And to awaken the immoral mind!
When the mind focuses only on sex,
He becomes a slave of undesirable passions!
His mind refuses to think,
His brain negates reason,
He loses his sense of balance,
And above all,
He wastes his vital force,
The power of the universe,
The wonderful vitality,
Lost in immoral actions!
Sexual misconduct like rape is a grave sin!
It becomes unpardonable,
When forced upon,
Or brutally imposed upon on an innocent soul!
A sexual misdemeanour is
The most horrifying act,
An act of grave violence,
To be condemned!
For a sexual pervert ‘Ahimsa' is
Totally alien and incomprehensible!"
208,Emotion,GreedPoemsWhatIsGreedPoembyJeanetteTelusma,"Greed is black in color.
It is selfish in every aspect.
It is normally one sided in nature.
It's glory is only for a moment.
It is like a deflating balloon.
It eventually catches up, watch.
Greed is dark.
It thinks only of itself.
It is very imbalanced.
It's happiness is fleeting.
It gets real small in size.
The seeds sown will soon reap a harvest."
209,Emotion,GreedPoemsGreedPoembySALININAIR,"End of life was in tune
Melody that swings somewhere
Strange mind swish a hope
I need a shoulder to cry on
Long years of solitude
Awed ways that marched lonely
Plead for love in empty corners
Thrash that hooked in vagueness of life
Find love in a deserted corner
Hug it with the disastrous wings
As death admired as its part
Greed of love that sinks itself
Death is a mentor of life and love
Span that wait to seize its spark
Moves to its mouth with empty hands
Contracted love that lilt always
Plea for love is the greatest deed
String that lies in bottom of heart
Sometimes unknown or ignore
But hurts as its greed……

between the broken down
and vacant buildings....
through the alleyways..
concrete graveyards...
the hint of smoke hangs
in the air.... the stain of soot,
the taste of death... lingers....
i closed my eyes and saw
the bodies... strewn in the street
like trash blown against a fence...
eyes wild, faces contorted, ...
death, and it's brothers and sisters...
storefronts dark and ominous,
gas pumps stand alone like angry
sores, oozing into the emptiness.
great black birds fly, casting shadows
that search for tiny particles of light....
stray dogs roam in packs,
hungry for flesh!
only the sound of the great
oil rigs pumping in the distance....
an old tattered flag blown
by a cold infidel wind!"

only two diving boards
Guess which gives and
guess who hoards?
From FEAR stems
a survival instinct
Reason soon leaves,
reaction- no think
Fearful they are of death
and the end
Grab all they can
and try to defend
When death's illusion
dies rattling
There will be
cessation of battling
We'll never run out,
there is more than enough
Go with abundant flow
it's really not tough
Drop the body
when it is time
fly the heck outward,
the real YOU, sublime"

Company C E O's not paid in thousands but in millions every year
Yet few of their type known for to help anyone in poverty
In a World where some have too much so much inequality
So many wealthy people from our Earth Mother take and take
From her precious resources their fortunes they do make
Her gold, silver and precious minerals, her uranium and coal
The more they have the more they want their greed out of control
For abusing the one we live off of the price may be huge to pay
Of droughts and famines caused by Climate Change we read and hear of every day
For the curse of Global Warming human greed in part to blame
Our abuse of our Earth Mother is only to our shame
The World is getting warmer from north to southern shore
And the greedy from our Earth Mother keep on stealing more and more."

Shelter of a roof not touching the sky,
I can walk with feet don't need to fly.
But I want the greed,
How dire is the need,
Of a peace making deed,
See the painful bleed.

Unlimited is this need,
And limited is my greed."

When outstripped are our needs by Greed

All moral laws we cease to heed.

At break-neck speed our aims we chase,
When outstripped are our needs by Greed
Or love of Fame our skill outweighs.
To harming others should this lead,
So what?  For Fame so strong our craze,
The banner 'buy or bribe' we raise!
We mind not making others bleed,
When outstripped are our needs by Greed."

Alone for some ideas
To request as “please’

“If object found on read” and elates
Such is the common greed
Rampant in human mind indeed
We re taught
Rather caught
With wrong philosophy
And alter on feel pity
Mind one thing
It is related to something
Any ill gotten thing takes away
Double the value of item in any way
Accept the bribe of any kind
That shall make you restless and blind
You will be filled with arrogance
That money may not allow you peace at once
We have habituated it as normal
Not objected to any time on arrival
We shall accept as if it is blessings
But mind that it is enough for downing
It shakes whole foundation
It makes you corrupt and puts big question
You see gain in each effort
That prevails ship from reaching port"

222,Emotion,GreedPoemsGreedIsADeadlyVicePoembyBhargabiDeiMahakul,"This is what many fall in trap of it is greed
For many desires it originates does breed.
Seed is the attachment towards all matters,
For wealth, money or food it always flatters.
This is a vice originates from a clumsy mind,
Nobody understands it opens branch in wind.
Like spreading of spider's web it does catch,
Person who falls in its clause does not fetch.
Many do crime falling in love of greed here,
People get tortured by them and get fear.
They bear fruits of sins as do in greed later,
Even they do not like to leave know better.
It is truly said sins are acquired from greed,
Sins with bondage take towards death seed.
Richer to richest fall down and commit crime,
Greedy persons think only wealth is the prime.
Not only the greed brings sorrow but also pain,
Due to capture of illusion, wrong things we gain.
Matters are the motivators and are cause of sad,
Greed is a deadly vice pauses life and really is bad.
Greed goes away while we all do meditate God,
Mind stabilizes rules over senses catches pod.
Greed nods before pure mind and leaves place
By grace of God we gain purity and win the race."

He writes all these squiggly lines.
They glow and come alive.
They become these characters dancing upon the pages in my mind.
Each one has his own name.
Jacob, John, Sarah and James.
Brothers sisters the way it should be.
A dad that always been their.
A mom that actually cares.
A refuge from the dead place I live in everyday.
A mastery of plays.
A white picket fence, painted so perfectly.
Erected out a child imagination.
Please he needs to be fed.
Can you not see hes living in filth and starvation.
But we always turn away.
Just burn it all to the ground.
Its okay just look into the clouds.
Ignorance is bliss but if you take it too far it becomes the ugliest indifference.
The creature manifest and comes to his own.
He starts corrupting the hearts and souls within.
Greed will be his tool to the absence minded fools.
To busy staring at their t.v.
Playing with their nifty gadgets.
Driving their fancy cars nice and warm.
No care in the world.
Why should they ever have to?
To blame, we should all have to write of what we are ashamed.
The nameless name.
A hollow tube stuck down some old mans throat not because he will live any longer.
But because it does not pay if he dies.
The world has been compromised.
Confidential are so many of the lies.
Put it all in the open.
Show us the contract in which sign on too the slavery of society that doesn't care about you.
Their is no golden rule that will forever protects you.

Always expected in return."

Greed is like an uncontrolled steed
It might gallop in reckless speed
Any time it can kick you down to bleed
Sometimes even causing a stampede
Running after wealth is often a wild chase
The snobbish, wealth can easily entice
Often they have to pay a heavy price
For greed generates greed and many a vice
Money is seen by some as master and Lord
And they compete, everyday to hoard
Even if a lot of wealth is procured
Alas, one never feels fully secured

Minimize the wants and focus only on the need
Thus from monstrous greed, let us be freed"

They killed the animals for food and skins
And also to protect themselves from their attacks
But we the civilized ones opted it for pleasure
For making money out of the ill gotten ways
By continuing the killing spree as poachers.
The bison, wild boars, elephants, and tigers
The king of wild the Lion, and the hippos
The rhenos, sambars, and beautiful other wildlife
Slowly and purposely destructing by fire arms
In fact the human being acts as the destiny makers
Of all the wild life which is to be objected.
This beautiful world and forests are entitled to all
For the humans as well as the wildlife we know
Save the world from perishes and protect the wildlife
As well as the forest which have immense wealth
Not only for today or tomorrow but upto the infinite time.

Follow the Christ,
away from the world

showing obedience, trust in the Lord

as a humble servant
not the throne
a king in an earthly realm
Out things, this focus on our wealth
a prison, chains on our hearts

Truth paying tithe to logic it much lacks,
From need to greed, to coveting when turns,
The vulture1 vies when voracity kissed.
And lo, if greed on wings falls way behind,
Forget if learned lament recession,
The world would fairly well-off itself find,
Call it a benign cooling of passion,
Dampening of red greed and blasé desire,
That fueled markets to a raging fire,
O at last on a greed-starved way to wind
In a world void of vultures with greed blind.

Yet rob so many of what they heard
The more you give the more it takes
And does not care even when it aches
Since no one checks what you make
It presents itself with such discreet
You may be mistaken and think it is neat
It demands very little at the start
Just wait until it settles in your heart
And dictates how subtly you can start
The more you get the more you want
And you find you can’t wait to start
You begin to cheat when others retreat
And learn to carry it out on the street
Not knowing you are aiming for defeat
When greed gets sweet you get in more deep
Makes you such a thief you can hardly sleep
You try to be wise with your smart compromise
Little do you know that your boss in disguise
Knows your scheme and planed otherwise
Business he knows seldom will grow
When greed sets in and gives it a blow
Wisdom demands to weather the storm
Confront and disarm before any alarm
Deal with the issue and avoid any harm
Shame on your name brings you pain
Greed can only give you earthly gain
Check out your motive before you defame
You have given talent kept it from stain
Ask for forgiveness and settle the claim

He was having dexterity
Enough he earned in money

Even to his kith and kin.
He prospered in such speed
Together he was in greed
For money and gold gained
But still unhappy and bad mood
No one was devoted to him
Even his best half in dejection
Still he loved his money
All was well for years
Hypnotized on influence of money
Delectable events slowly lost
He became ill for ever
Even to drink water difficult
Swallow food was not easy
The day came, his death time
People says his eyes were not closed
May be looking for money

238,Emotion,GreedPoemsGreedAmericanPoembyKevinPatrick,"Although America did not invent greed
It certainly made renovations when it purchased that institute
And gave it gaudiness attractive for a car salesman;
No other empire in the world can lay claim to being founded
On the principals of debt, Credit Ratings and Insurance Premiums
As a vehicle to facilitate global supremacy in the economic markets
There's know other country in the world who puts a higher price in freedom
Then America who sells it for a good premium quid pro quo
Infidelity is the beneficiary
Of the capitalistic spirit
Perhaps the Romans would have survived
Had they invested in a credit line"
239,Emotion,GreedPoemsAfterThoughtOnGreedPoembyGangadharannairPulingat,"Humans always in craze for wealth
For accumulation of wealth he runs fast
The thorny ways, deep pits and hills
No matter what becomes to his soul
The greed always shuts the divine ways
Slowly it becomes the habit
No matter what others sees in him
The material enjoyment he prefer always
The charity to the needy for namesake
Greed destroys the wise character
The greedy seeks the way of narrowness
Where ultimately it is self destruction
The destruction of the humanness
When in ultimate reality awakens him
He is on the horns of dilemma, that hounds
Only legitimate creative action saves
To lead a comfortable life of enjoyment."
240,Emotion,GreedPoemsOfGreedAndCorruptionPoembyFrancisDuggan,"Of greed and corruption we are all too aware
It's happening in your suburb and the big World out there
Many in high places into corporate crime
And more honorable than them in jail serving time
On the scales of justice one must cast a doubt
Big time corporate crims seldom ever caught out
Money speaks every language some are known to say
In the twenty first century it does seem that way
Of greed and corruption the whispers abound
Amongst influential people criminals to be found
To buy their way out of trouble they seldom do fail
The power of their money can keep them from jail
And of greed and corruption we hear every day
Whoever did tell us that crime does not pay?"

248,Emotion,GreedPoemsAhimsa12ThePowerGreedPoembyDrGeetaRadhakrishnaMenon,"The most vicious and dangerous
Is the power greed!
This stems from an enormous
Ego!
Not an ordinary sized ego
But much, much bigger than
A mountain!
It is not like a solid structure either
Because an ego keeps growing
And expanding,
Moving and leaping
Into gigantic proportions!
It seldom diminishes,
It is like a balloon filled with helium,
Bloating and floating high in space!
The power greed stems from the
""I"" sense.
Not the simple,
""I am the owner of this house""
But the notoriety of
""I want to be the owner of this earth.""
The power greed is never satisfied,
It asks for things, again and again.
The greed plans the strategies,
As how one could be crowned as
The Dictator!
To be dreadfully important,
Powerfully holding everything under the thumb,
Not just people or countries,
But Mother Earth too!
All along the way,
Of becoming a powerful emperor,
The greedy pursuits are accompanied
By various ‘Himsas'!
Each thought, word, or deed
Is a game plan,
To cut and wipe out,
Annihilate and destroy,
The innocent ones!
When each cell of the body
Pulsates with power greed,
How can ‘Ahimsa' be practised?
To demolish the power-greed
One has to scorch the seed of
The violent and powerful ‘I'!"
249,Emotion,GreedPoemsFulfilYourNeedButNotYourGreedPoembyPdishere,"The history of Earth dates back to millions of years ago,
When a perfect engineer, ‘the God’, created this world.
He made life in forms of plants and animals,
And for all gave them Earth - the abode.
The plants and animals lived in ideal harmony,
And there was no trace of agony.
Everybody sought merely what was required,
Nothing superfluous anybody acquired.
The man came at the end
And learnt expeditious for himself to fend.
Soon he realized the powers he had,
And it drove him nearly mad.
For others he had no regard,
With nature he remained forever at odds.
He amassed much more than needed,
“Be Cautious” - the nature pleaded.
Soon the environment was left degraded.
Animals and plants slowly faded.
Towards catastrophe the world headed,
And hasty correction was severely needed.
Mercifully, man has now realized,
The world has sufficient for everyone’s’ need
But if overexploited
It would succumb to man’s greed.
Today he is trying to reverse the cycle
By protecting Mother Nature so vital.
Almighty forgive mistakes of your creation
And give him strength for positive action
To prevent this world from extinction.
AMEN"

251,Emotion,GreedPoemsTheNeedAndTheGreedPoembyRmShanmugamChettiar,"Need is a desire; greed is a desire.
Desires denied, sufferings surface.
Need is met at ease but not the greed
Which is boundless with sufferings profound.
Need and greed aren’t in water tight cells.
Need might restrict to physical wants.
Greed is for ego’s gratification.
Possessiveness is the sign of the greed.
To earn by wrongful means is from greed.
To exploit and hoard is an act of greed.
To garner and flaunt all you have is greed.
Greedless, though penny-less, you’re loveable.
To sedate the pride is to tame the greed.
To kindle the pride is to fuel the greed.
Having got money, power and possession,
As the result of greed, you will lose peace.
Remove the greed; jealousy is gone.
Remove the greed; no feeling of revenge.
Hail the poor and condemn the greedy.
Then the tendency to grow rich will wane.
Live simple; live humble; then need is less.
Be proud to own a bicycle, not a car.
Value one who owns a bicycle, not a car.
You will have saved energy and the nature.
Don’t embrace comforts, which will weaken you.
Don’t enthuse with ego, which will make loss big.
Unlike the cheat, being poor is not a shame.
Less wants; less sufferings, more happiness."
252,Emotion,GreedPoemsTheTreeOfGreedAndSufferingPoembyAbdulWahab,"I spread my greed as a tree  spreads  its root
Deep and wide into the ground, straight
To suck upon the sap with its  tip
And send it directly to the  leaf
More I go deep more I get
More sap I get more gets me greed
Behind all of my troubles cause  is the root
The result of my misdeeds   blooms
Into a flower and hangs from every shoot
I bear the suffering as the tree  bears  the fruit"
253,Emotion,GreedPoemsConsequencesOfMansGreedPoembyRameshTA,"Since time immemorial man lives in harmony with Nature;
But with the scientific inventions and technological progress
Man has slowly drifted from his habit due to domination of
Profit motive of commercial interests spreading far and wide!
Modernization of nations and coming of civilization sans
Touch with human culture have disturbed the course of Nature
Leading to climate changes bringing long droughts and heavy
Cyclonic wind and rain flooding many nations frequently now!
Not bothering about recycling of natural resources in his hurry
In exploiting Nature for raw materials, fuels and foods, man has
Brought upon himself the wrath of Nature that balances itself
With drastic measures by bringing hottest days and biting winters!
Unless man changes his attitude and way of living in harmony
With Nature all things can't be set right to normalcy forever....!"

Hundred lives, hundred souls in death to drag;
Amidst a square, where families come to play,
At a train station, at a club, night or day;
No one is safe, ask those who survived the blast,
No one knows how much more the shooting will last,
Yet from all I see this I know to be true,
No God, nor yours nor mine, could ever order,
Such pain and such tears, such a gruesome slaughter,
Nor crave for others' blood, nor show such a hate,
I see human greed put religion for bait;
I see men and women dying for a cause,
That knows no borders, nor obeys to our laws.
Alas! This hatred must now find an end
Alas! Let no more lives to be lost and spent
Alas! Listen not to the words of those few
Who thought lives don't matter, lying is what they do;
Open your eyes and for once just stand and see,
Monsters are born as strong as they could be,
You know them well, you've seen them many times before,
They aren't called Religion, nor Race, nor War;
No soul, no mind, they cause innocents to bleed,
These monsters only have one name and that's Greed!"

Ready to take advantage and proceed

We always want more

And he loved fame and money.

Squish him in hell,

Greed is the source of financial and social trouble

266,Emotion,GreedPoemsAhimsa11TheMoneyGreedPoembyDrGeetaRadhakrishnaMenon,"The money greed is not a simple greed.
Yes! One needs money to live,
Only to live a contented life,
Not to get wrapped in avarice.
The greed that envelops
To hoard and collect,
To possess much more than one needs,
Verily, is money greed!
Avarice for possessions is
A serious habitual trait,
A grave hindrance,
To the practice of 'Ahimsa'!
A fanatic desire for material goods,
To acquire more and more,
By fair or foul means,
Leads one astray!
Accumulating, enveloping oneself with
Innumerable goods, articles and structures,
Leads to much confusion,
Leaves little place for vital air!
To stand or sit -
Does one require much space?
To sleep on a bed -
Does one need more than a few square feet?
Do we ever think or reflect?
How much space we require when we die,
To be buried or to be burnt?
Just a bare strip of earth!
Yet, we forget this fact,
We continue in our material pursuits,
Ever greedy and avaricious,
Hounded by hundreds of things!
We spend our quality life
Pursuing money and material!
In this race of life,
Does ‘Ahimsa' ever figure?
On the contrary,
In the pursuit of pleasures,
It is infliction of pain, misery,
Careless and callous!"

He is moving on a dangerous track,
Why she is shouting, ""He is a crack.""
Why her eyes are wet, is it love?
He knows, he doesn't fly like a dove,
He knows it's a rope not a bridge,
The teen aged girl is standing on a ridge.
But his eyes are on her pink gown
He, a lover, who never looks down
Journey of his eyes from feet to face
Kissing and embracing her silky grace
It's the midway and his eyes are at rest
To get back his breaths the spot is the best
Looking into his eyes why she is shy?
Prayers for her lover! Looking at the sky!
The same crazy in disciplined naughty boy!
Different metals, can they form an alloy?
May be; love is a magic, a force a might
Anytime can change the wrong in the right
He's close to the heart, a valley to adore
Listen to the beats climb more, climb more
Here he is, he can see her dancing hips
Hands round the neck, lips on the lips!
Writing and stamping a wordless deed
Welcome, welcome if love is the greed!"
268,Emotion,GreedPoemsGoodToGreedPoembyJasmeherKathuria,"He wanted to study, but he was forced to work,
He had to earn for his family, this, he could not shirk.
He used to work hard and bore his family's load,
He spent many nights, on the bench by the road.
All he begged was for a proper meal,
But to help the poor, had nobody the zeal?
He tried educating himself without anyone's help,
He didn't want to be looked upon as a poor little whelp.
He had big dreams of becoming rich and acquiring property,
But these were all crushed by one word - poverty.
A person shouldn't be judged on the basis of being rich or poor,
But one's pride and vanity is what attracts them to this lure.
He was rich at heart, but had no money,
All people saw was a man who looked funny.
He wanted to leave a mark in the world, wanted to make a name,
But what stopped him was society's barrier of money, status and fame.
He tried to resist them, tried not to hear,
He battled his way through and overcame his fears.
He was becoming successful, people started to appreciate him,
He wanted to achieve more and hence became grim.
But soon he realised, he could not get his way,
Unless he obliged someone and by luck, got away.
He thought once, he thought twice, but still followed his intuition,
Knowing, that it would divert him from his mission.
He knew what the consequences were very well,
But poverty all over again, was just as good as hell.
He wasn't himself anymore, he had been consumed by greed,
That might've been the reason that led him to commit a misdeed.
He had risked it all, unfortunately, luck was not in his favour,
But this wrong deed was more than just a misdemeanour.
Now in jail, humiliated, bankrupt and full of regret,
He stabbed himself and ended his life's vignette.
His life could have been better, he could have had it all,
If he was happy and unsatisfied, would have just been a squall.
He stood at the cliff of goodness, right above the abyss of greed,
But it was too tempting, he jumped right into it, all just to bleed."
269,Emotion,GreedPoemsAStoryOfLoveAndGreedPoembyKristinNicoleRothDavis,"Long ago in a far away land
Ruled a evil King with a strong hand
He was mean and he was cruel
Such a man should never rule.
He had a daughter and a loving wife
Two tall sons and a marvelous life
His lack of appreciation for what he had
Made the King’s family very sad.
Gold coins piled high with plenty for his needs
Could not satisfy the King’s vast greed
He taxed his Subjects and he stole their land
Issuing proclamations full of bold demands
The beautiful Princess– no longer a girl
Gave her hand in marriage to a handsome Earl
Rode away with her husband on a prancing steed
Leaving behind the King consumed with greed
The oldest son loved adventures, games, and sport
He soon grew weary of the boring court
Where nothing occupied his royal father’s day
But thinking of ways to make his Subjects pay.
One fine day the Prince could stand no more
Made plans to head for a distant shore
Strapped on armor and a sharp-edged sword
Sailed far away to fight a distant war.
The King took no notice of his children’s flight
He sat counting money all through the night
The youngest son stopped as he went to bed
Stood watching the King and sadly shook his head.
The Prince worried about his father – his mother, too.
He wished that he knew the best thing to do
Nothing good could come of the King’s evil gain
Seeing his parents drift apart gave the young man pain.
Finally the Queen, with a broken heart
Sighed and climbed aboard a rickety cart
She used this vehicle to steal away
One early morning at the break of day.
Riding along behind a long-eared mule
She cursed her husband for being a fool.
Through the Village Square; past a flowing fountain
The Queen drove her mule up a towering mountain.
A magical genie lived on the mountaintop
Reaching the wizard’s home, the queen did stop.
That she would be found, she had no fears,
Here the Queen could be safely hidden for years.
No one knew the Queen was alive and well -
No one but the youngest son who would not tell.
The Queen sent her son a note inside an ancient ring
and begged him not to tell his father, the King.
Sitting in his castle on his massive throne
One day the King realized that he was all alone.
There was dirt on the windows and on the floor
He hadn’t eaten all day – and his stomach was sore.
The King cursed loudly and then yelled for his wife
She had always cared for the desires of his life
“Why has she deserted me? ” the poor man moaned
“She could have left a note – or she could have phoned.”
Ah, but the Queen was happy and very content
She only regretted the lost years she had spent
Worshiping at the feet of the man she called “Honey” -
Catering to the man who loved nothing but money."
270,Emotion,GreedPoemsYourMonsterGreedPoembyAbdulWahab,"One you bought
A beautiful one
I know the second one
You bought with much hardship
You could not get the third one
Even with hardship
But you strongly desired it
So you picked it up
Now you are under my supervision
Under my captivation
I kindle a fire
Of more and more
I am the fuel myself
And help it to burn
I live on it
And it is my staple food, too
Even if you wish
You would not be able to douse it
I would prevent you
Even to meet with peace
Then I would drive
Your happiness out
Who are you to talk like this?
I am no one but your monster greed."
271,Emotion,GreedPoemsGreedPoembyGalinaItalyanskaya,"Catch the sun
And lock into the cell
To offer it for sale…
Guy, you're still not happy.
Make a sound,
Declare: ‘It is mine,
So you can buy it here,
But do not dare to copy! '
Let your thought
Be signed as solely yours,
Certificated, patented
To fill your bank account.
You forgot,
If you have ever known,
Guy, what you really own
Is what you care about.
One can swear
The land belongs to him,
And he can build his firm,
He has all needed papers.
He's a liar.
He only takes and leaves
Polluted air and rivers,
Exhausted soil and people.
When your heart
Looks for another heart,
It tries to reach the stars,
It sings to someone dear.
Does it hurt,
If songs are spread for free?
Is that your only creed
To sell and never share?
Tell me if
It came across your mind:
Your greed would make you blind,
Your greed would make you poor.
You believe
That wealth is worth your soul.
Thus you will mute its song
For sure.

From one corner to the farther,
And from sitting room to the ‘ther,
Flying from ceiling fan to fan,
Wondering on greed of a man!
Why on earth they need such big nest?

We as do our chicks this month end.
Wonder if we can our modest

Stop building castles in thin air,

It is for those, that pile up treasure and put on fat, to chafe
At the bit and grasp for more, the way they hunger for a safe
As broad as the ocean, and so deep, that it'd never touch the seabed,
I say to myself: ah, you herd of blind fools, bank away, bank,
Ruining your days with anxieties, lose night after night of sleep,
Do shady deals and diddle: then what? Old Granpa Time'll creep
In with his scythe, and slice away at your bundle of plans, hank after hank.
Death's hidden away, and hunkers inside the clock-tower;
And no one can say: Tomorrow, once more I'll
Still hear midday ring out like today, at this very same hour.

He didn't see himself as uneducated,
thwarted, or bitter,
but soon-to-be rich.
Being rich was his right, he believed.
Happiness, I used to think,
was a necessary illusion.
Now I think it's just
precious moments of relief,
like dreams of Guatemala.
Sometimes, at night,
in winter, surrounded by
the significant silence
of empty mansions,
which once were cottages,
where people lived their lives,
and now are owned by banks
and the absent rich,
I like to stand at my window,
looking for a tv's futile flickering,
always surprised to see
instead
the quaint, porous face
of my reflection,
immersed
in its one abundance."
276,Emotion,GreedPoemsOldTypewritersAndGreedPoembyAufieZophy,"In the past we felt there was a need for greed
we felt that in order to make it and succeed
we had to win, we had to compete
winning was all, not minding the heat.
But there is a new vision of life:
It involves kindness without strife
we want to share our time and all things
and enjoy the sheer happiness it brings
There is no feeling good in abuse and greed
No joy in the feeling of an ever increasing need,
If we cannot change our old views of success
we 'll forever chase but never achieve happiness
Soon greed will survive only in a small minority
since more and more of us start seeing the superiority
of practicing kindness love and simply sharing
of living a life filled with compassion and caring
There are some old typists who still want to use
only old typewriters since computers, they refuse
There are still people clinging to greed and division
not willing to accept life's new kindness filled vision.
Obviously old typewriters are absolutely obsolete
Soon this will be true also for the stupidity of greed
We will all value that happiness and peace of mind
only originates from love, sharing and being kind."
277,Emotion,GreedPoemsInTheSwirlOfGreedPoembyAmitavaSur,"Knowledge teaches us
How much  is our need
Vices inundate
In the swirl of greed.
Increasing knowledge
Lessens the needs
Guides the  soul
Towards wisdom and  peace
Vices are like
Cancerous germs
Increases the greed
To destroy oneself.
Goal of life
Is to attain love and peace
With greed
We can never reach that place.
Greed is
Like a hunting trap
It allures, attracts
And ruins at last.
Increasing knowledge
Lessens the needs
Guides the a soul
Towards wisdom and  peace

279,Emotion,GreedPoemsGreedAndObsessionPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"Greed and obsession
Money has lot more roles to play
And hold sway
Over men's desire
To remain admired
It creates position
When relatively found good relation
Consolidated enough clout
And talked about
Not only have you become greedy
But get ready
To perform any thing
That is unworthy of something
People resort to murder
When find no means to alter
Economic condition
And social position
So prosperity has become yardstick
With strict
Inclination and possession
And obsession too"
280,Emotion,GreedPoemsAhimsa9ThePalateGreedPoembyDrGeetaRadhakrishnaMenon,"We have to remember that
'We eat to live - not live to eat.'
But this line is forgotten
By most of us!
The palate greed craves for food,
It is not just hunger but a reckless habit!
The mouth chews continuously,
Straining the jaw muscles
And the palate!
Like we need rest after a day's labour,
So does the digestive system needs to pause,
From constantly churning the food bolus!
The salivary glands,
The gastric glands,
The Brunner's glands,
The glands of Liberkuhn,
Become hyperactive and
Vastly enzymatic!
When the stomach and intestine,
Work at double speed
And overtime,
Obviously, the result is
Acidity and
Indigestion!
A glutton can never think
Beyond the stomach!
The question posed here -
Can such a person practise ‘Ahimsa'?
May be! May be not!
A glutton may not harm others but
He harms himself with excess food!"
281,Emotion,GreedPoemsGreedPoembyTedSheridan,"I hang from the top shelf of a hard life
like a dusty and old lambrequin
Thus tattered by parasitic mites and torn
from the sheer weight of my grasp
I gaze at the many rich food stuffs and prized
white elephants that safely exist
Just beyond my tried and failed reach in my futile
attempt to possess their reward
Like the meaningless shiny things carried back
to the nest by a greedy crow
And placed there in the sunny window
of its relatively darkened existence
Purely but significantly as a trophy to be
seen and thereby envied for its plumage
Though it be of anything other than a strictly
ornamental garnishment or trinket
With not even the abilities of a b_stard wing
let alone provision or stipulation
I hang from the top shelf of a hard life….
Not wanting to quit or give
When I still have the strength to hang on
ten seconds longer than the next guy….

283,Emotion,GreedPoemsMansGreedPoembyPaulSebastian,"God fashioned man out of earth
In His image and breathed life into him
Woman He created for him to love
Dominion over creation, He gave him
Eden's Paradise, earthly heaven as his treasure
Man, yet succumbed to Evil One's temptation
Greed banished him from heavenly pleasure
To till the earth for food; to earth, his destination
Greed begets even more deprivation
Man's insatiable greed has no limitation
He has learnt not despite Eden's first lesson
In his heart, greed to be like gods, lives on
Man looks for strange gods to trust
He worships the god of material riches
Falls at the feet of goddess of lust
Bows before goddess of envious witches
His heart wears pride as the devil's crest
Prowls to steal, kill and destroy: No glitches!
Powers of darkness, his propriety
Offers food to the god of gluttony
Religion abused in the name of Almighty
Alibi for rapes, killings; massacres for tyranny
Rich get richer; the poor suffer in dire poverty
Eco-green sacrificed to fatten an economy
Rapid industrialization, at expense of man's health
No regard for our children's futurity
Insane to abuse and rape Mother Earth!
Recklessly tampering with his posterity
Suffer man with floods, drought and eco-pollution
Mother Nature, suffocates in global warming
Flash weather changes, flash floods displacing thousands
Displaced millions more in nations that are warring
Coveting a people with self-stamped ideological warrants
Marriage institution wearing, gay-marriages in
Cultural norms challenged and evolving
Social-religious values trampled, crumpling
Is this the apocalypse man's hastening?
Has man begun his own grave digging?
Would he relent to warning cries and sober?
Rebel till it's too late? Then cry, 'Oh, my God! '
Would he forcefully usher in a new world order?
Would he elect the Chaotic Leader of days of old?
Man is mere earthly man, not God
He cannot play God, not reincarnate God
(He'd reincarnate the devil in him, as his god!)
Mother Earth, he must respect
Mother Nature, he must protect
God's Law he must hearken
To God he must return
Not become, himself, a god!

284,Emotion,GreedPoemsExtraGenerationalGreedPoembyGedionOnyango,"It's long since I stopped believing in human wisdom.
Long since I stopped distinguishing wisdom of the old - and
Stupidity of the new generation
It's un-intelligible to know what the new generation does differently
Within the organismic experiences of life
-But isn't this the problem!
Or is it that the older generation have become the epitome of every evil?
As youths make no decisive legislation
On climate change
War
Waste disposal
Gender equality
Racism
Human trafficking
Migration
Marriage
political repression!
The wisdom of the older generation have always reigned!
But nothing has changed
Many like them drown in the seas,
cold and terrified
to find solutions
The same prematurely die on wetness of their blood in the streets with unwanted wounds. Or stupor
I have seen the older-generation diving us into black-holes
Of despicable practices in the name of patriotism, religion and color
All seemingly wiser
and all-knowing
Although our conspicuousness rightly haunts us
As beneath it all, we know the truth - and it's all on greed
It's demonic nature is encapsulated in the tongues of decency
and diplomacy - or sometimes - political correctness!
It's all in the appetite for repressive power
-But isn't this the problem
Or should we just believe because they've said, we're the future
While we're soothingly killing this uncertain future - who knows?
- But isn't that the problem?
Or is it that the youth have lost their ways?
The youths!
They've hardly known what they need!
Hardly in control of themselves - most of them are rabid
Retracting not from the facade path of the older generation
Instead they as their mothers, have become custodians of
Hatred
Arrogance
Drunkenness
Confusion
Ungodliness like their lost fathers
The spring of all evils!
-But isn't that the problem?
That we've become drawn into darkness
As we resent the light?
That we question every simplicity of life
Preferring to align with its complexities
- making life unknown
Creating a world Where truth and facts, lies and slanders
simply switch places
As all we need is who says them and how they say them to us.
Where we believe our realities are different and indistinguishable to
- Darkness and Light
- But isn't this the problem?
Or is it the choices we make
- and
What and Who we are taught
To love
To hate
To despise
To assist
And religion - But not God - to be loyal to?"
285,Emotion,GreedPoemsFoodForGreedPoembyImaRyma,"A food bubble ready to burst?
Cuz speculators on Wall Street
Drive high food prices to their worst,
To bank big buck bets as we eat.
Some say deregulation made
A mess of food demand/supply.
The have nots hungry, while haves trade
To make money on sell or buy.
Most haves worry most of their worth
In terms of money and eat well,
While hunger ravages the Earth.
Fat cat heaven makes hunger hell.
Money feeds the global food biz.
What of we eat wherein greed tiz."
286,Emotion,GreedPoemsAGreedForAllGoldenEggsPoembyRameshTA,"Furious attacks by Nature as earthquakes and storms,
Heart breaking scenes, are horrible imprints in mind!
Why is Nature so harsh to mankind remaining calm long?
Many poets have appreciated its beauty, grandeur, mercy
Almost to the level of Supreme Creator of all everywhere!
But Nature shows its other face though Moon hides ever!
Materialist man has taken for granted Nature's love for all
Just us we all breathing air forget ourselves of its existence!
Perhaps that's the case Nature shows its wrath of its presence!
Nay, man's blunder in exploiting natural resources beyond limit
Without any sense of recycling them at all and selling farms
For urbanisation of villages Nature shows its wrath so harsh!
Instead of thanking Nature's generous gesture man destroys
All like the greedy man who killed goose to take all golden eggs!"
287,Emotion,GreedPoemsGreedAndMoneyPoembyKaileeHeckathorn,"Greed...  Is half of humanity, the other is money. Could humans fix the corrupted senses of it's own soul, and heal the mental outer body of our full self? No we can't because that's what makes us human. Money will never buy one enternal happiness, but is money serving as a distraction to further intelligence or is it just all life is and will be. Greed and money will always be there, but it's up to us to control it."
288,Emotion,GreedPoemsMyPettyGreedPoembyCHOUDHURISUKUMAR,"People with petty greed ~ how much do they get
Not all people have big-sized greeds
We very ordinary
bunch of people with petty greed
Don't even have courage to feel big-sized greed
My petty greed has often been met
by petty donors
Twice or so I was saved
by the God on my shelf
After safe escape I gave a smirk
Indulged a bit in intellectual conceit  Ah
Escaped narrowly honour is saved
Yet my petty greed was not quenched
Even now I make rounds to petty donors
Ah they too are small-time people
They too live within limits
How can they give their all
Even if they give do I have the guts
to pull all up to the roots.
Can people with petty greed geta full amount
Very ordinary person I
pulled by petty greed
Ever go round and round
Come back home take bath daily
Light the lamp on my shelf
God keep saving me
Very ordinary person, me
haven't even got the courage
to feel big-sized greed.

To reap the stipend that I do
Will mean, therefore, I look at you
From high above in my success
And say to you, 'Poor thing, God bless.'
The greedy bastard that I am -
I love to drown in bling;
Unlike you – so bloody poor, and
Picking coins up off the floor!
But sorry mate, I'm not to blame –
The fact your bank account is lame!
Come and see my flashy car
Awash inside with leather;
I saw the battered wreck you drive,
Spewing out its oily smog!
Your banger, friend, is such a dog,
Clanking out its dialogue.
I shall die in gleaming wealth,
Floating out in gentle stealth –
Having bought a glowing health.
As for you, my hard-up mate,
You'll fade away a slave to fate,
Surviving on the welfare state.

so there is no place for the greed

only miseries are there for them to be told
Dear countrymen of the land
consider no one as a friend
when they are doing nonsense
and make the people tense
yes, they lived with luxury
and this added to the poverty
people remained starved
and many died
Let wars are not waged
and people tied and caged
this is cruel treatment
and shameful act at present
the whole of the world may witness
and face
the wrath of the people
who will come out and revolt

All he wanted was there,
but reaching it seemed unfair.
All he wanted to do, he could,
But always wondered if he should.
What could he do with all his money?
all his expensive belongings seemed funny.
He had a mansion, garden a car,
but all the love was really far.
With pain in neck he walked around,
all alone with just a frown.
He deserved it, he totally did,
it was all because of his greed.
A young man, when he was,
he never even tried to measure his loss.
Now creeps him a pain,

301,Emotion,FearPoemsTheFearOfFearPoembySamahKhan,"Fear is not what I am afraid of.
True, it is a frightful thing to fear;
But the fear of fearing fear is overwhelming
Especially when its form becomes sheer
Fear is like losing a tree of shade on a bristling day
Or losing your breath when you fall below the sea;
I fear this fear of fearing these fears
And it is this fear that is part and parcel of me.
Fear is like loving without being loved back,
Fear is like leaving without being left;
And the fear of loving and leaving and being loved and being left
Is opposed by the fear of not fearing anything
And being an empty vase, noisy and bereft
I fear not death nor do I fear life,
But I fear the fear of both as my peers;
If I could release one fear from my fears
It would be the fear of fearing these fears."

To destroy the face of innocence
Of one that is a child."

In all my meekness and volatility,

But for him it was crystal clear
His thoughts on life and death.
Religion grasps at our own docility,
plays to the masses our susceptibilities.
He was, indeed, a pioneer.
It may just be strife and breath.
Is it beyond ignorant capabilities?
To pursue a fathomed possibility
that gods are just the last frontier
In modern man: imagineer.
No need for religion that brings hostility.
The atoms resume to be life and death."

Walk side by side.
I chat with the witch,
About cook recipes,
Not even the monsters,
I do despise.
No only one thing,
Do fear with a passion,
No, it’s not girls,
Who’re too into fashion.
I fear for to be lonely,
Without family and friends,
If they were all gone,
The my life would end."

That thou consum'st thy self in single life?
Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,
The world will wail thee like a makeless wife.
The world will be thy widow and still weep,
That thou no form of thee hast left behind,
When every private widow well may keep,
By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind.
Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;
But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
And kept unused the user so destroys it.
No love toward others in that bosom sits
That on himself such murd'rous shame commits."

A heart beats endlessly
pondering on what is out there

But God hath breathed upon a worm,
And sent me from above
Wings such as clothe an angel's form,
The wings of joy and love.
With these to Pisgah's top I fly
And there delighted stand,
To view, beneath a shining sky,
The spacious promised land.
The Lord of all the vast domain
Has promised it to me,
The length and breadth of all the plain
As far as faith can see.
How glorious is my privilege!
To Thee for help I call;
I stand upon a mountain's edge,
O save me, lest I fall!
Though much exalted in the Lord,
My strength is not my own;
Then let me tremble at His word,
And none shall cast me down."

Why you can't take chances and stay on the safe side.
Why you never sit in the front seat, or go on Six Flags rides.
Why you don't leave the house, even when you want to.
Why you don't have many friends to talk to you.
As Scared, Anxious and Modest as you appear, people think you're crazy, all I see is Fear."
311,Emotion,FearPoemsDonTFearDeathPoembyAleksandrAleksandrovichBlok,"Don't fear death in earthly travels.
Don't fear enemies or friends.
Just listen to the words of prayers,
To pass the facets of the dreads.
Your death will come to you, and never
You shall be, else, a slave of life,
Just waiting for a dawn's favor,
From nights of poverty and strife.
She'll build with you a common law,
One will of the Eternal Reign.
And you are not condemned to slow
And everlasting deadly pain."
312,Emotion,FearPoemsAFearPoembyFrankieStones,"I didn't know what to do,
I was trapped,
A prisoner,
A slave,
I had nowhere to run,
Nowhere to hide,
Nowhere to go,
And nowhere to cry,
I'm all alone in this world
I have no shoulder to cry on,
No person to love,
Nothing to look forward to,
Yet I go on,
I live my life
In fear of everything,
I fear I will never find love,
I will never feel the warmness inside,
That I long to feel,
The warm touch of someone close,
That I wish to feel,
I will never find,
That I will always love,
The soul mate,
I'm always thinking of.
What is there left in this world for me?
Nothing or is it just worth waiting,
Just to see,
What might happen?
And will I ever become free."
313,Emotion,FearPoemsFogOfFearPoembyJoeyNissen,"The fear swells up
I begin to dread
That time in my life
That my life will end
The fog gets so thick
I can barely see
My brain starts to wonder
What will happen to me
I look over my shoulder
But no one is there
I could die right now
But I just don't care
Inside my chest
My heart begins to race
The end is so near
It's right in my face
The fear swells up
I begin to dread
That time in my life
That my life will end"
314,Emotion,FearPoemsFearAnAbcPoemPoembyMelvinaGermain,"A pack of wolves stood by quietly watching.
Beginning to act frustrated and anxious.
Calling with howls of anger, piercing eyes glow.
Finally leaping towards a fearful hunter."
315,Emotion,FearPoemsFearPoembyRachelFogle,"What causes the fear that people feel,
When there scared and have to face the truth.
What cause that fear that people feel,
When there in love and have been hurt.
What is it that there afraid to face,
When fear is at the door.
Do they think that they can just walk away and not face it head on.
Because when you turn your back on that fear,
It follow's you night and day.
It creeps up when you least exspect it, and haunts you everyday.
Fear is just another diease that's waiting to be cured.
But the cure is not in a bottle, a vile or a store.
The cure is made from what's inside you.
The courage that you have.
But to use it, you must believe that fear is not all that you have.
Use what courage you can, to bring yourself forward and stand tall.
And the next time your afraid, remember fear is never far from the fall."
316,Emotion,FearPoemsFearPoembyJustAmr,"Fear of the unknown
is what makes me behind
Fear of tomorrow
is what makes me blind
Fear of the darkness
is what makes me seek the light
Fear of losing
is what makes me fight
Fear of pain

Fear of getting crushed
is what makes me struggle in vain
Fear of punishment

317,Emotion,FearPoemsFearPoembyAnalissaRange,"It is in the small things we see it
A spider in the corner
A hairy monster on the prowl
Lighting  on a dark night
A flash of ligh that brings a scream of rage
A new room filled with the unknown
The staring faces and smug looks of others
Later
If you return with a knowledge packed head
You do it with the dreaded anticipation of the day ahead
You do it hiding from the monsters
The laughing monsters of pain and hurt
You do it as a black shadow
Flickering between the light and the dark
Later
If you survived the hell of a thousand faces
You emerge with painful memories
But also with a hope of a new life
This is short lived
The stacking of bills
A never ending stream of debt
The dark monster trying to steal a loved one away
Emerging behind words of pain and hurt
Smothering your dwindling hope
Later
After a life fully lived
Your fear is in the struggle to stand
In the winter
The horrific beauty of the ice
In the Last sickness of your life"

322,Emotion,FearPoemsTheGhostOfFearPoembyMickLines,"The Ghost of Fear
Oh! What a terrible demon am I
Invading your thoughts, infecting your lives
Making you think twice, hesitate and stress
Causing self doubt and making you less
What will they say, Oh! What will ensue?
My Mother, the Vicar, the children and you?
And what of the neighbours, what will they do?
Their curtains are twitching, eyes peeking through
Can I afford it, is it too dear?
My purse strings are stretching… breaking I fear!
But, she’s a Blackman, but he’s a girl!
This is not natural
Very strange world!
Is it too late? Do I have time?
Perhaps I should leave it
At this age of mine
Is it too sweet, is it too fat?
Should I enjoy it?
I couldn’t do that!
My hips are too big, my bum is too fat
My legs are too skinny
My boobs are too flat!
Is it still safe, is it secure?
Can I still trust it?
I’m not so sure
So, throughout your life I constantly speak
Holding you back, so humble so meek
When will you realise God gave you a choice
And open yourself to that sure inner voice
But oh! You’re so weak of poor human seed
And I’m happy you stay so
For I continue to feed!

323,Emotion,FearPoemsAdolescentFearPoembymaggieoke,"Adolescent fear never speaks in its own language
Always translated into the impure tongue
Of cocky
Mock confidence
Mutating into
Terrifying others
But not me
Each morning resolute to spread a little knowledge
Inspire a little, fighting another tide
Which is pulling them
Each morning they arrive resolute to fit in
Look cool
Be popular
Stay safe
A handy tool
Is mock the teacher
Show no interest
In the offerings
Of knowledge
And inspiration
Let battle of two tides commence"
324,Emotion,FearPoemsASonnetOfFearPoembyJoLynnEhnesAllen,"When life becomes a trembling world of fear,
you question every single move you make,
afraid your loving soul will disappear;
for danger looms, awaiting your mistake.
What hidden word will cause explosion's might
to back you in a corner of despair?
Your sole reprieve lies in the ebon night,
yet anger boils from pain he wouldn't spare.
Where love once dwelled resides a burning hate
as desperation's hand has gained control.
No longer viewed as your eternal mate;
to save yourself becomes the utmost goal.
Envisioning a pool of crimson red;
a knife within your hand; your fear is shed."
325,Emotion,FearPoemsFearOfFailurePoembyMichaelFischer,"Fear of failure has failed me again!
I’ve hit rock bottom so many times
that it has become my second home.
I can’t find what I’m looking for...
because I don’t where to even look.
Loneliness stood by me for so long,
but now even that abandons me!
Now all I have left is emptiness!"
326,Emotion,FearPoemsFearAndIntuitionPoembyAmberleeCarter,"That night I heard your voice
it woke me,
bolted through my body
like electricity does wet feet.
It was shocking,
I found myself
shivering in a cold sweat-
Unable to move to your side
for refuge,
my tongue went lifeless,
my lips sealed as if to kiss-
I swear I tried to save you.
The clock blurred in motion-
The night, hugged my insides so tightly
I fought to breathe.
I sought to rationalize the moment,
to make sense of the flies
motionless in the air-
why my hands were so invisible.
I rushed to your bedside
to find you
old and diseased-
I caressed your hand,
accepting the truth:
eventually, no matter how unfair
someday all mothers die-
even when there are torn hemlines
and broken children
in need of mending."
327,Emotion,FearPoemsOfGodlyFearPoembyJohnBunyan,"Us godly fear delightful unto thee,
That fear that God himself delights to see
Bear sway in them that love him? then he will
Thy godly mind in this request fulfil.
By giving thee a fear that tremble shall,
At every trip thou takest, lest thou fall,
And him offend, or hurt thyself by sin,
Or cause poor souls that always blind have been
To stumble at thy falls, and harder be
Against their own salvation and thee.
That fear that of itself would rather choose
The rod, than to offend or to abuse
In anything that blessed worthy name,
That hath thee saved from that death and shame;
That sin would soon have brought thee to, if he
Had not imputed righteousness to thee.
I will love them, saith God, and not depart
From them, but put my fear within their heart,
That I to them may always lovely be,
And that they never may depart from me."

Through my fears.

There's lingering fear like a zit growing on your nose
There's groundless fear like a dark day covered by a clear night
There's inarticulate fear like a little fish wolfed down by a shark
There's sudden fear like a demon startled by an unfamiliar ghost
There's mortal fear like a soul baffled by heavenly hell
There's fake fear like a popstar blowing his/her lines
There's undying fear like boomerang returning to hit you hard
There's cryptic fear like a stranger ringing at your doorbell
There's fatal fear like falling prey to a predator
There's introverted fear we've invented by ourselves
And have to live with it."
330,Emotion,FearPoemsFearPoembyricograham,"Don’t be afraid of fear
Because fear is afraid of itself
You give into fear when you doubt yourself
Fear makes you a complete opposite of yourself
Draining every bit of confidence your body has left
Fear tricks you of your potential
Wiping away your credentials
A life ruled by fear is life without hope
Of course people are going to have raining days
But with fear, everyday you will have your droughts
Be confident and put your head up high
How can fear overtake you when you’re looking at the
Beautiful clouds high in the sky"
331,Emotion,FearPoemsFearNotDearFriendButFreelyLiveYourDaysPoembyRobertLouisStevenson,"FEAR not, dear friend, but freely live your days
Though lesser lives should suffer.  Such am I,
A lesser life, that what is his of sky
Gladly would give for you, and what of praise.
Step, without trouble, down the sunlit ways.
We that have touched your raiment, are made whole
From all the selfish cankers of man's soul,
And we would see you happy, dear, or die.
Therefore be brave, and therefore, dear, be free;
Try all things resolutely, till the best,
Out of all lesser betters, you shall find;
And we, who have learned greatness from you, we,
Your lovers, with a still, contented mind,
See you well anchored in some port of rest."
332,Emotion,FearPoemsAStruggleTwixtLoveAndFearPoembyHughCobb,"Too oft in time
it seems a crime
to open up one's heart.
Comes into play
that which  we fear,
from which we run away:
the fear that love will soon depart
& all abandon'd shall we be:
alone forevermore, drowning in a sea
of pain, remorse & self-pity.
So heed me well! Listen here.
Love comes not with a guarantee.
My friend, 'tis gamble all or none!
But if your fears do keep you safe,
you'll miss out on all the joy & fun
that risk & love alone can bring.
So take a chance!
Don't be a waif.
Let your heart dance
& spirit sing.
Love now, love more today!

333,Emotion,FearPoemsFearPoembyAishaSherazi,"How does fear start?
When we are so small,
Fear of being alone,
With our cries we call.
Then comes further fear,
Fear of things we can't see,
Fear of the dark,
“Please don’t leave me.”
Then comes more fear,
Fear of unacceptance,
Do they want to be my friend?
Will this fear ever end?
Then comes teenage fear,
Fear of growing up,
Is this all I will be?
Will anyone ever trust me?
We pass through,
So much fear,
We go through it,
Year after year.
In old age we come full cycle,
Fear in our old bones,
We return to the oldest fear,
'I don’t want to be alone.'
Finally fear of death,
Comes with our last breath,
And that's when one comes to see,
Fear is reality.
Fear is the biggest test,
It never lets us rest,
So don't give fear a chance,
To hold you in a trance.
Take it by its toe,
In your heart, open a window,
Throw fear out and you will see,
Once and for all you can truly be free."
334,Emotion,FearPoemsFearPoembyCiaranCarson,"I fear the vast dimensions of eternity.
I fear the gap between the platform and the train.
I fear the onset of a murderous campaign.
1 fear the palpitations caused by too much tea.
I fear the drawn pistol of a rapparee.
I fear the books will not survive the acid rain.
I fear the ruler and the blackboard and the cane.
I fear the Jabberwock, whatever it might be.
I fear the bad decisions of a referee.
I fear the only recourse is to plead insane.
I fear the implications of a lawyer's fee.
I fear the gremlins that have colonized my brain.
I fear to read the small print of the guarantee.
And what else do I fear? Let me begin again."

And live a life
That is the source of nectar."
336,Emotion,FearPoemsFearNoMorePoembyWilliamShakespeare,"Fear no more the heat o' the sun;
Nor the furious winter's rages,
Thou thy worldly task hast done,
Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages;
Golden lads and girls all must,
As chimney sweepers come to dust.
Fear no more the frown of the great,
Thou art past the tyrant's stroke:
Care no more to clothe and eat;
To thee the reed is as the oak:
The sceptre, learning, physic, must
All follow this, and come to dust.
Fear no more the lightning-flash,
Nor the all-dread thunder-stone;
Fear not slander, censure rash;
Thou hast finished joy and moan;
All lovers young, all lovers must
Consign to thee, and come to dust.
No exorciser harm thee!
Nor no witchcraft charm thee!
Ghost unlaid forbear thee!
Nothing ill come near thee!
Quiet consummation have;
And renowned be thy grave!"
337,Emotion,FearPoemsBookIiiPart04FollyOfTheFearOfDeathPoembyLucretius,"Therefore death to us
Is nothing, nor concerns us in the least,
Since nature of mind is mortal evermore.
And just as in the ages gone before
We felt no touch of ill, when all sides round
To battle came the Carthaginian host,
And the times, shaken by tumultuous war,
Under the aery coasts of arching heaven
Shuddered and trembled, and all humankind
Doubted to which the empery should fall
By land and sea, thus when we are no more,
When comes that sundering of our body and soul
Through which we're fashioned to a single state,
Verily naught to us, us then no more,
Can come to pass, naught move our senses then-
No, not if earth confounded were with sea,
And sea with heaven. But if indeed do feel
The nature of mind and energy of soul,
After their severance from this body of ours,
Yet nothing 'tis to us who in the bonds
And wedlock of the soul and body live,
Through which we're fashioned to a single state.
And, even if time collected after death
The matter of our frames and set it all
Again in place as now, and if again
To us the light of life were given, O yet
That process too would not concern us aught,
When once the self-succession of our sense
Has been asunder broken. And now and here,
Little enough we're busied with the selves
We were aforetime, nor, concerning them,
Suffer a sore distress. For shouldst thou gaze
Backwards across all yesterdays of time
The immeasurable, thinking how manifold
The motions of matter are, then couldst thou well
Credit this too: often these very seeds
(From which we are to-day) of old were set
In the same order as they are to-day-
Yet this we can't to consciousness recall
Through the remembering mind. For there hath been
An interposed pause of life, and wide
Have all the motions wandered everywhere
From these our senses. For if woe and ail
Perchance are toward, then the man to whom
The bane can happen must himself be there
At that same time. But death precludeth this,
Forbidding life to him on whom might crowd
Such irk and care; and granted 'tis to know:
Nothing for us there is to dread in death,
No wretchedness for him who is no more,
The same estate as if ne'er born before,
When death immortal hath ta'en the mortal life.
Hence, where thou seest a man to grieve because
When dead he rots with body laid away,
Or perishes in flames or jaws of beasts,
Know well: he rings not true, and that beneath
Still works an unseen sting upon his heart,
However he deny that he believes.
His shall be aught of feeling after death.
For he, I fancy, grants not what he says,
Nor what that presupposes, and he fails
To pluck himself with all his roots from life
And cast that self away, quite unawares
Feigning that some remainder's left behind.
For when in life one pictures to oneself
His body dead by beasts and vultures torn,
He pities his state, dividing not himself
Therefrom, removing not the self enough
From the body flung away, imagining
Himself that body, and projecting there
His own sense, as he stands beside it: hence
He grieves that he is mortal born, nor marks
That in true death there is no second self
Alive and able to sorrow for self destroyed,
Or stand lamenting that the self lies there
Mangled or burning. For if it an evil is
Dead to be jerked about by jaw and fang
Of the wild brutes, I see not why 'twere not
Bitter to lie on fires and roast in flames,
Or suffocate in honey, and, reclined
On the smooth oblong of an icy slab,
Grow stiff in cold, or sink with load of earth
Down-crushing from above.
""Thee now no more
The joyful house and best of wives shall welcome,
Nor little sons run up to snatch their kisses
And touch with silent happiness thy heart.
Thou shalt not speed in undertakings more,
Nor be the warder of thine own no more.
Poor wretch,"" they say, ""one hostile hour hath ta'en
Wretchedly from thee all life's many guerdons,""
But add not, ""yet no longer unto thee
Remains a remnant of desire for them""
If this they only well perceived with mind
And followed up with maxims, they would free
Their state of man from anguish and from fear.
""O even as here thou art, aslumber in death,
So shalt thou slumber down the rest of time,
Released from every harrying pang. But we,
We have bewept thee with insatiate woe,
Standing beside whilst on the awful pyre
Thou wert made ashes; and no day shall take
For us the eternal sorrow from the breast.""
But ask the mourner what's the bitterness
That man should waste in an eternal grief,
If, after all, the thing's but sleep and rest?
For when the soul and frame together are sunk
In slumber, no one then demands his self
Or being. Well, this sleep may be forever,
Without desire of any selfhood more,
For all it matters unto us asleep.
Yet not at all do those primordial germs
Roam round our members, at that time, afar
From their own motions that produce our senses-
Since, when he's startled from his sleep, a man
Collects his senses. Death is, then, to us
Much less- if there can be a less than that
Which is itself a nothing: for there comes
Hard upon death a scattering more great
Of the throng of matter, and no man wakes up
On whom once falls the icy pause of life.
This too, O often from the soul men say,
Along their couches holding of the cups,
With faces shaded by fresh wreaths awry:
""Brief is this fruit of joy to paltry man,
Soon, soon departed, and thereafter, no,
It may not be recalled.""- As if, forsooth,
It were their prime of evils in great death
To parch, poor tongues, with thirst and arid drought,
Or chafe for any lack.
Once more, if Nature
Should of a sudden send a voice abroad,
And her own self inveigh against us so:
""Mortal, what hast thou of such grave concern
That thou indulgest in too sickly plaints?
Why this bemoaning and beweeping death?
For if thy life aforetime and behind
To thee was grateful, and not all thy good
Was heaped as in sieve to flow away
And perish unavailingly, why not,
Even like a banqueter, depart the halls,
Laden with life? why not with mind content
Take now, thou fool, thy unafflicted rest?
But if whatever thou enjoyed hath been
Lavished and lost, and life is now offence,
Why seekest more to add- which in its turn
Will perish foully and fall out in vain?
O why not rather make an end of life,
Of labour? For all I may devise or find
To pleasure thee is nothing: all things are
The same forever. Though not yet thy body
Wrinkles with years, nor yet the frame exhausts
Outworn, still things abide the same, even if
Thou goest on to conquer all of time
With length of days, yea, if thou never diest""-
What were our answer, but that Nature here
Urges just suit and in her words lays down
True cause of action? Yet should one complain,
Riper in years and elder, and lament,
Poor devil, his death more sorely than is fit,
Then would she not, with greater right, on him
Cry out, inveighing with a voice more shrill:
""Off with thy tears, and choke thy whines, buffoon!
Thou wrinklest- after thou hast had the sum
Of the guerdons of life; yet, since thou cravest ever
What's not at hand, contemning present good,
That life has slipped away, unperfected
And unavailing unto thee. And now,
Or ere thou guessed it, death beside thy head
Stands- and before thou canst be going home
Sated and laden with the goodly feast.
But now yield all that's alien to thine age,-
Up, with good grace! make room for sons: thou must.""
Justly, I fancy, would she reason thus,
Justly inveigh and gird: since ever the old
Outcrowded by the new gives way, and ever
The one thing from the others is repaired.
Nor no man is consigned to the abyss
Of Tartarus, the black. For stuff must be,
That thus the after-generations grow,-
Though these, their life completed, follow thee;
And thus like thee are generations all-
Already fallen, or some time to fall.
So one thing from another rises ever;
And in fee-simple life is given to none,
But unto all mere usufruct.
Look back:
Nothing to us was all fore-passed eld
Of time the eternal, ere we had a birth.
And Nature holds this like a mirror up
Of time-to-be when we are dead and gone.
And what is there so horrible appears?
Now what is there so sad about it all?
Is't not serener far than any sleep?
And, verily, those tortures said to be
In Acheron, the deep, they all are ours
Here in this life. No Tantalus, benumbed
With baseless terror, as the fables tell,
Fears the huge boulder hanging in the air:
But, rather, in life an empty dread of gods
Urges mortality, and each one fears
Such fall of fortune as may chance to him.
Nor eat the vultures into Tityus
Prostrate in Acheron, nor can they find,
Forsooth, throughout eternal ages, aught
To pry around for in that mighty breast.
However hugely he extend his bulk-
Who hath for outspread limbs not acres nine,
But the whole earth- he shall not able be
To bear eternal pain nor furnish food
From his own frame forever. But for us
A Tityus is he whom vultures rend
Prostrate in love, whom anxious anguish eats,
Whom troubles of any unappeased desires
Asunder rip. We have before our eyes
Here in this life also a Sisyphus
In him who seeketh of the populace
The rods, the axes fell, and evermore
Retires a beaten and a gloomy man.
For to seek after power- an empty name,
Nor given at all- and ever in the search
To endure a world of toil, O this it is
To shove with shoulder up the hill a stone
Which yet comes rolling back from off the top,
And headlong makes for levels of the plain.
Then to be always feeding an ingrate mind,
Filling with good things, satisfying never-
As do the seasons of the year for us,
When they return and bring their progenies
And varied charms, and we are never filled
With the fruits of life- O this, I fancy, 'tis
To pour, like those young virgins in the tale,
Waters into a sieve, unfilled forever."

Making no since and trying to make it through
Its just not the same..not with out you
I’m not perfect and you never cared
Every pain, dream, and secret is all we shared
Laughing all day just to forget what we went through
I know this laughter is fake but what else can I do
The small things remind me such as a picture in a frame
But we both know that it will never be the same
I need my sister and i’m telling you all
don’t ever your sister fall
The pain of losing you sister is so much more
Something that no teenager should indoor
Wipe the tears off my face and try to make it look like I can keep on going
But I don’t know how much of this fake joy I can keep showing
don’t ever lose your sister and keep her near
Teach your sister how to love and how to always be dear

That  thought makes me want to scream.
I have Fear of my life.Every day that’s not much
I could say on that, I try give it my strife
The real world gives me fear too.
Sometimes, “I wish everything would disappear
Instead appear into fear”.
The Fear of losing my mother before I am ready to let her go.
What road do I take so I won’t let fear win.
Fear takes my thoughts of losing my husband, and
losing one of my children too.
Even though, I almost did loose a child.
I can let the fear, do what it is doing..
I fear of losing my dearest friend.
I am sorry I cant pretend that fear is not here.
The fear of my own death and the cause of it will be?
I don’t want to see.
The fear of my lifestyle should  it be  the way it should be lived?
or should it be change?
Do I dear change it, but how?
I know that I have a fear of being alone.
It’s the unknown
Is My Biggest Fear"
341,Emotion,FearPoemsFearHauntsTheEyesPoembyGrahamJones,"Fear haunts the eyes, of the terrified young
Slaughter replacing, days once filled with fun
Streets full of laughter, now places of dread
Market squares littered, with the dying and dead
Tiny hands clenching, coats tattered and torn
Relying on mothers, to keep them from harm
Cordite and dust, still thick in the air
Stinging their eyes, now filled with despair
Truely an age of innocence passed
Drawing on breath, which may be their last
Brought into a world, full of violence and hate
What kind of impression, do we hope to create
The youth of today has ourfuture on hold
Bitter and twisted, we created the mould
No love or affection, just the will to deprive
How can we as a race, ever hope to survive."
342,Emotion,FearPoemsFearNotFearFearFearlessnessPoembyBashyamNarayanan,"Fear
An emotional preparedness
To face an eventuality
To manage an unacceptable development
To negotiate with a less amenable group
Fear is weakness, some say
Fear is strength, some other say
Fear often is quoted as reason
For our doing something or not doing
The nature and extent of fear
Are based on self-experienced earlier occasions
And sometimes on others' experience
A close examination will reveal
We fear not the event or the situation
But its impacts
On our financial, professional, social standing
Fear forms the spark for insurance
Which ensures at least the financial imbalance
Gets rectified to an extent
While experience paves way for fear
Non-experience knows no or less fear
Over-experience also makes one fearless
Fear also indicates
Our preparedness to see things go right
If fear is weakness
Fearlessness can prove dangerous
Basically we need to fear
But this should not stop us from going ahead
Fear, but venture with proven precautions
Know well in advance the impacts
Plan adequately to meet the consequences
Never ever arrogate yourself to fearlessness
Fear not fear
But fear fearlessness"
343,Emotion,FearPoemsFearChildAbusePoembyTracyRollings,"Rainy days and stormy nights
a train running through my mind
tree's fall knocking out the lights
and I somehow, lose all track of time
I sat there in that corner all alone
wondering what will happen next
praying that he didn't come home
I was wrong, now I'm in a hell of a fix
I heard her tell him, I got beat up bad
he had to come and look for himself
when he saw me crying he did get mad
after that beating, all I thought of was death
I was always wrong because he had his own rule
and no matter what I did, it just wasn't enough
I even had thoughts of camping out at school
because living at home was getting to be rough
I use to cry a lot, but I got broke in with pain
it's hard to do at time, and I can't understand
holding the tears all the years who can explain
he walked around, proudly calling himself a man
He just didn't know what I had been thinking
pay him back for all the pain that he gave me
wait till he passed out from all the drinking
could burn the house down and I would be free
It's sad to think of all the pain a child gets
so hard to deal with and seems no one cares
they go through this life with so many regrets
from living in shame and hiding from fear
when will it ever stop?"

Do you see the sunshine

Do you feel the laughter

Do you feel the pain

Do you understand the world?
.....Ask if you are real.
Do you understand our time?

Do you know the answers?

Do you know why we hate?
There exists inside us fear."

hangs
weightless in the air.
Suspended like an

Marking the

Striking the senses

It mists up the

like fog.
And sets the skin
Crawling
From the body.
Beyond the smell
is
the dark.
Endlessly covering
the limits
of reality and possibility.
The fear of the
unknown
against the safety of the mundanity.
Walking forwards, the
darkness
retreats into the earth.
Folding in on itself
until
rushing forward to encompass.
It breathes into

its invisible depths.
Deeper, deeper. the

Sounds are amplified
to a
fearful crescendo.
Anticipation hangs
ripe
for harvest.
Something waits,
feeding
on the taste of fear.
Something not right
Something different
Something greater
Something that is not meant to be
Something wrong
Something not human
Not human.
Instinct takes over
Undiluted fear floods through the veins
Pumping through the body,
Ripping apart all reason,
Animal fear takes hold
The last vestiges of civilization fall.
And all other emotions are thrown away into the maelstrom of dread awe.
Giving way to the terror of the hunted.
Blindness
Darkness

When you aren't clear.

In place of a tear,

Drive away your fear.

Focus on what

Then you’ll notice
Your not afraid
If your not afraid
Of death why be
Afraid of any thing else
To conquer your fears
Confront them
If it heart break
Lose the love of your life
But it will be hard to go alone
But if you ever notice you’ve
Always been alone
No one there to help ease
The pain
That’s why I go down the path of hate now
My fear is to love again"
348,Emotion,FearPoemsFearPoembyChristineMcKeen,"I stand on the shore line,
the tide washes between my toes.
I stare at the horizon before me
in a dream-like state.
I should have been prepared.
My mother once said life is more
than you want it to be.
When the sky transforms into
a water color painting,
the water washes between my knees.
My eyes fixed on the horizon.
I knew it was coming,
but I was blinded by fear
and couldn't acknowledge it.
The moon replaces the
sun in the night sky.
The water rises to my neck.
I inform Hell, I am coming.
I shut my eyes as the salty water
rises over them.
I notice my fear has won again.
I open my eyes,
to watch the brightness of stars,
darkened by the depth of the water.
At the bottom, there is no Hell
but life."

Responded to the war call – means and ends
Endeavoured to ally while bomb descends
Each day as Fate played out the game that year.
Dreams freedoms canvassed as tide turned appear
OMitting nothing, - yet each one depends
For sustenance upon the first which lends
Real substance sends the others, signal clear.
One pushed without the other’s insincere,
Mocks as it lo[o]cks on ethics Man defends,
Freedom today bends, hostage, - who transcends
Explicit rules, dares flout laws out of gear?

350,Emotion,FearPoemsFearOfWeatherPoembyChrisTusa,"Once a favorite conversation piece,
now something more like a disease.
A weathervane sings, a wind chime clangs.
It’s December, only a slight silver breeze,
but already I’m imagining the tangled
metal of cars, birds falling from the trees.
My therapist says fear is normal,
that it’s simply a matter of degrees,
the brain has an internal mechanism,
she says, a switch that flicks on and off with ease.
I imagine a kind of silver machine
in my brain, humming like a hive of bees,
fear hopping from synapse to synapse
like some sort of electric, Post-modern flea.
Each day I swallow my grief like a pill,
ignore my therapist’s advice, my wife’s pleas.
I wait for the sky to fall, longing for the days
when wind was only wind, trees only trees."

The short fear is that even saying it
in my own way is equally pointless"
352,Emotion,FearPoemsFearSirFearPoembyPaulSebastian,"That arresting fear!
That crippling fear!
That haunting fear!
Spirit wrecking fear!
Fear of loss of love
You court broken hearts
Accompany the rejected
Celebrate loss of loved ones
Before you many die defeated
Fear of failure
You cleverly drown success
Whispering believable doubts
Thief of dream-chests
You tout dreamers’ walkouts
Fear of poverty
You chain the poor in misery
Kill off initiatives, ambition
Feed worry and uncertainty
Bring indecision and procrastination
Fear of Criticism
You work on self-doubts
Wreck self-esteem
Make-believe what others thought
You kill possible dreams
Fear of ill-health and death
You wait with scythe at hell’s door
Lure weaklings into traps of wealth
Peddle illnesses, deaths your score
Devastate families, sell your wreaths
Fear of old age
You breed insecurity of dependence
Steal pride and honour
You rob freedom, after-life assurance
Bring on old-age wine’s stupor
I fear you, Sir Fear
You, father of lies
Father of all fears
Who marries you, dies!

353,Emotion,FearPoemsFearNotFearPoembyMarkFarmer,"Fear not the storms in their darkest hour
Fear opens doors so evil can devour
Fear not the dark ways which lurk around
Fear takes your joy and chains you bound
Fear not the morning as you awake
Fear creates disorder that’s no mistake
Fear not the troubles that cross your path
Fear can dismantle you with its wrath
Fear not those things in all you do
Fear has no home when Christ Jesus is in you"
354,Emotion,FearPoemsWeMeetAtTheJudgmentAndIFearItNotPoembyVachelLindsay,"Though better men may fear that trumpet's warning,
I meet you, lady, on the Judgment morning,
With golden hope my spirit still adorning.
Our God who made you all so fair and sweet
Is three times gentle, and before his feet
Rejoicing I shall say:—""The girl you gave
Was my first Heaven, an angel bent to save.
Oh, God, her maker, if my ingrate breath
Is worth this rescue from the Second Death,
Perhaps her dear proud eyes grow gentler too
That scorned my graceless years and trophies few.
Gone are those years, and gone ill-deeds that turned
Her sacred beauty from my songs that burned.
We now as comrades through the stars may take
The rich and arduous quests I did forsake.
Grant me a seraph-guide to thread the throng
And quickly find that woman-soul so strong.
I dream that in her deeply-hidden heart
Hurt love lived on, though we were apart,
A brooding secret mercy like your own
That blooms to-day to vindicate your throne."
355,Emotion,FearPoemsNoNeedToFearMyFriendPoembyBobGotti,"Yes indeed, I'm going home one day very soon my dear friend,
My life on this earth is but a journey, it's definitely not the end.
Though there be wars and rumors of wars and all the earth be taken,
With my hope in The Rock of The Ages, my peace will not be shaken.
But those who know not The Lord will be taken down Satan's warpath,
Spiritually deceived they are all being led to God's final bloodbath.
But God's children have been redeemed and put on Salvation's path,
Have The Lord Jesus as their light and fear not war or the aftermath.
God's Judgment will fall on those who chose to mock and simply laugh,
But, those who chose to humbly fear The Lord will not suffer wrath.
And before God pours His Judgment down upon this wicked vile earth,
The Lord Jesus will first come to the clouds, to rapture His Church.
Friend, with many ominous signs you can be sure the end is very near,
Christians whose eyes are fixed on Jesus have nothing at all to fear.
Like the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of The Son of Man,
Take a look friend, and see these signs today are definitely at hand.
The earth became corrupt and all the people had corrupted their ways.
The earth was filled with violence friend, and this was Noah's days.
Not woe, but The Lord's return is what we should all be anticipating,
And with joy, for He comes with Salvation to those who are waiting.

356,Emotion,FearPoemsNoMoreFearOfMyBeastPoembyScarlet,"for I no longer fear my beast
I will not try to hide it anymore
I will no longer lock it inside
for I will not fear what is within me anymore
I will no longer fear what they created
I will embrace my beast
I will learn how to control it
instead of it controlling me
I will use it to break down the wall
the wall I’m trapped behind
I will use it so I can be seen
for when I embraced it
I became in control
for when I embraced it
it became part of me
it works with me now
not against me
it helps me over come my obstacles
I myself don't have the strength for
for it will teach me ways to release my anger
instead of bottling it up"
357,Emotion,FearPoemsItStartsWithTheFearOfGodPoembyBobGotti,"It starts with the fear of God my friend and the fear of God alone,
That removes self from the heart and places Jesus on the throne.
Worldly knowledge won't change your heart, won't change it at all,
For my heart and yours, my friend, was tainted way back at the fall.
Even if you read God's Word and thoroughly understand what it said,
It won't benefit you at all my friend, if it only stays in your head.
For a head full of knowledge, even understanding, is only the start,
It becomes a true Saving Faith when you accept Jesus into your heart.
For it is with your heart you believe and are justified in His sight,
And with your mouth you confess and are saved, much to His delight.
The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom, and will be to the end,
For this world's wisdom is folly, in the eyes of The Lord my friend.
The fear of God is not weakness my friend, as it leads to Salvation,
While no fear or reverence towards God above leads to Damnation.
Man's wisdom and his desire to be God leads down all the wrong paths,
As God who sent His Son, as the Only Way, sits in Heaven and laughs.
These men always learning will never come to The Truth who will save,
And like the nations that forget God will be turned into the grave.
But there still is time for you to turn to The God of all creation,
And with fear in your heart, you can embrace His Truth of Salvation.

live my life with fear,
the fear to unjustly die.
It is not what you first hear,
I do not fear lack of breath.
I am worried about dying inside.
I do not fear eternal rest.
I am worried for my broken pride.
I lay in pieces on the floor,
with lack of peace to be found.
And I hope for you to open my door,
I wish you could gaze upon me downed.
I miss you away from my side,
and generally away from my life."
360,Emotion,FearPoemsSonnetWhyFearWhenGodsNearPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"What if your enemy just follows you,
And monitors your rise most shamelessly;
Beware and keep away from such men too,
Who love to hound good men relentlessly.
What if your friends have become foes, whole-lot?
You live in solitude, no soul to talk!
Much noise emanates from an empty pot!
Don’t ever turn back; just continue your walk.
What if the mighty Satan chases you,
From place to place, pillar to post, endless?
Ignore his calls, appearing calm; just do
Right things, the harder way round with fairness.
When God’s with you, why should you ever fear?
He’s your Friend who cares- with heart and ear!"
361,Emotion,FearPoemsFearPoembyLivMealone,"As a baby
Fear was none...
... maybe crying when I'm hungry or wet or not cuddled or not sensing the familiar scent of my mom's bosom...
As a Child
Fear was the darkness that is the friend of monsters
Fear was the neighbor's dog that could bite me when I pass by to go to school
Fear was the time when I got home and nobody's there
Fear was losing my cat
Fear was the thought that I won't be in the honor rolls comes closing day.
As a Young Girl
Fear was having breakouts in my skin
Fear was being sick
Fear was the night when I hear my baby sister's occasional gasps as she struggles to breath with her asthmatic lungs
Fear was being caught looking at my seatmate's answers
Fear was having my best friend tell on me
Fear was my crush knowing I like him
Fear was the uncertainty of the future.
As a Grown Up
Fear are the what ifs that keep plaguing my mind
Fear are the pressing responsibilities that seem impossible to carry
Fear is tiredness of spirit when I seem to have nothing more to give
Fear is being weighed and found lacking
Fear is Fear itself.
As WHOEVER...

Walk by faith and not by sight
With faith you can conquer anything

Remember, you have nothing to fear
This battle is God's fight too
And He's never lost a fight, my dear
So why would he start with you?
Remember the Warrior you are
The leader of them all
God heard our war cries from afar
And now beside us he's fighting tall
God is with you now and tomorrow
And forever till forever's end
Please don't let life bring you sorrow
Because in God you've found a friend

Unknown to those with hidden faces
Bedecked and different, for them to leer
As one unknown, something to fear
Am I not I that you can see?
What is the fear you see in me?
This faceless one, that makes you quake
I hold no fear its what you make
Deceive yourself if that you may
And cringe from that which spells decay
I hold no terrors in these hands
I am but a vessel to unknown lands
There is nothing to fear but fear itself
Of what, the memory of love or wealth
You will take my hand, make no mistake
A new life starts as you awake."
364,Emotion,FearPoems877FearOfTheUnknownPoembyMelvinaGermain,"The wind was strong and the dust blew viciously.
Walking on a dirt road, not sure of my destination.
I encountered a coyote standing in the distance. My
first thought was to turn and run and then I
realized that might not be a good idea.  I slowly
walked, placing one foot quietly in front of the
other, while keeping my eye on the coyote.  The
animal did not move, it stood in the same position.
Fearful as I was, I didn’t want the animal to know
my fear.  I bravely took step after step and walked
toward the road.  Finally I reached a crossing in
the road.  When I turned to look back the coyote
was gone.  At that point, I felt sure I was safe and
continued to walk down the road.  When I
approached an old shack at the road clearing, I
noticed paw prints on the soft ground.  Immediately
I thought, what animal made those prints, surely
it wasn’t the coyote that I encountered earlier,
certainly not, don’t be silly I thought to myself.
Once again I continued to walk forward.  I could
feel butterflies in my stomach.  What were those
prints on the ground.  Trying not to think about it,
I began to walk faster and faster.  Suddenly I
heard a noise, it sounded like a scratching noise
behind me.  Oh what now, could that be the
coyote.  My heart was racing and the sweat
poured down my face causing my eyes to sting.
My vision blurred by my perspiration, I was beside
myself and was feeling very  sick to my stomach.
Never before, have I been so afraid, never so unsure
of myself.  I wanted to run, but once again
wondered if the animal that was following me
might run and attack me."
365,Emotion,FearPoemsFearTheEmotionPoembyBJAyers,"Fear, an emotion easily obtained,
Something we dread, or maybe of shame,
Fear for a life, or sickness within,
Emotions obtained, but difficult to contain.
An emotion in life, one we all share,
Fear of the unknown, fear of pain,
Fear of embarrassment, fear of death
No one likes it, but it’s always there.
So difficult to understand, often we may never,
To learn to accept, when others may not,
An emotion of agony and always pain,
A feeling of despair, yet so difficult to sever
Yet,  with the pain, help is there,
The friends we have, to help us through,
The faith we have, to pave the way,
To help us through, from those who care."
366,Emotion,FearPoemsFearPoembyRobertWilliamService,"I know how father's strap would feel,
If ever I were caught,
So mother's jam I did not steal,
Though theft was in my thought.
Then turned fourteen and full of pitch,
Of love I was afraid,
And did not dare to dally with
Our pretty parlour maid.
And so it is and always was,
The path of rectitude
I've followed all my life because
The Parson said I should.
The dread of hell-fire held me straight
When I was wont to stray,
And though my guts I often hate,
I walk the narrow way.
I might have been a bandit or
A Casanovish blade,
But always I have prospered for
I've always been afraid;
Ay, fear's behind the best of us
And schools us for success,
And that is why I'm virtuous,
And happy - more or less.
So let me hail that mighty power
That goads me to be good,
And makes me cannily to cower
Amid foolhardihood;
Though I be criminal in gain,
My virtue a veneer,
I thank the God who keeps me sane,
And shields me from distress and pain,
And thrifts me on to golden gain,
Almighty Fear."

Fear of death
Fear of rejection
Fear of loneliness
Fear of poverty
I hear it near, it stinks of hell my dear
In our hearts, body and soul we wear
Fear! Year in and year out in full gear
At times overwhelming and impossible to bear
Fear of being ridiculed
Fear of being single
Fear of being truthful
Fear of life always holding on to survive
Fear of change and what surprises it sprinkles
Fear of old age painted with priceless wrinkles

And make it plain and clear
Listen why be afraid of fear?
When fear itself can’t talk, walk, see nor hear!"

They don’t even know where it comes from
Fear is everywhere you don’t have to look
There are fears that scare little kids
Like the dark or the monster in the closet
But without fear the world would fall into darkness
There are some people that fear other people
And some that fear water
But a lot of people fear the end of the world
There are people that do not have any fear
They are the people that are different
Even if they hide their fears from humanity
I am someone that is different
But I will tell you my fear
And that is
The fear of my friends dying first
I could not live with out my friends
A man once told me that fear is away to run
Show no fear even in the eyes of the end
Fear is everywhere you look
I told you my fear
I think that you have a fear too
But if you dare to tell
That is your choose
I do not control you
I have said that fear is everywhere you look
What is your worst fear? ? ?
I will not judge you if you tell! ! !"

What happens inside the room
As he locks the door
He’ll ask me to lie in bed
And when I rebuff
A slap will hit my face
I’ll give in loosing my strength
Coz I’ll meet my death
If refuse to be good in bed
For how many years
I lived in fear
With torn self-esteem
One day I had the courage
To call for a quit
But I was outraged
A flying kick here
A rushing punch there
Luckily I got help
I was totally devastated
Hurt physically
But hurt more emotionally
Good thing he never came back
But still threatening me
To kill me when he is back
Many years have passed
The fear was still carried
Wish that fear can be buried"

And we be comrades, thou and I;
With fevered jowl and dusty flank
Each jostling each along the bank;
And, by one drouthy fear made still,
Forgoing thought of quest or kill.
Now 'neath his dam the fawn may see,
The lean Pack-Wolf as cowed as he,
And the tall buck, unflinching, note
The fangs that tore his father's throat.
The pools are shrunk--
the streams are dry,
And we be playmates, thou and I,
Till yonder cloud--Good Hunting!--Loose
The rain that breaks our Water Truce."

It cripples deep inside
It freezes the thinking part of you

Causing shivers to run down your spine
It reduces you to an empty shell
And destroys all that is fine
Don't let fear get a hold on you
Fight it with all your might
Once you bring that fear in the open
Your world has a chance to be bright"

Thy mirror true the sight I see,
And there you find your face too clear
And love it and be lost like me.
One the long nights through must lie
Spent in star-defeated sighs,
But why should you as well as I
Perish? gaze not in my eyes.
A Grecian lad, as I hear tell,
One that many loved in vain,
Looked into a forest well
And never looked away again.
There, when the turf in springtime flowers,
With downward eye and gazes sad,
Stands amid the glancing showers
A jonquil, not a Grecian lad."

I won’t give a damn, winter, spring, summer or autumn.
If you cross me, I’ll mow you down
like a huge caterpillar machine right to the ground.
I’m bigger than life, full of horror and strife.
I’ll take all you’ve got, even your life.
Friends-no, not your mother
your father,  nor your sister or brother.
Strong, powerful, big and fearless.
Your worst enemy, listen and hear this,
be alert, drug free, your mind must be clear
or you’ll be dealing with me out there.
I don’t care about your friends or your loving family.
I’ve been known to bring death to those who mock me.
So pick up your socks and take heed, or those
you love will fall in need.
I’m here, there and everywhere.
Don’t worry, prejudice you will not find.
I want all, young, old, rich, poor.
You can all come screaming through my door.
I’ve killed more people than you can imagine.
so c’mon working class, learn your trade,
be the best that you can be, and take top grades.
For those who excel, will certainly exceed.
Never become victim to my selfish greed.
They call me
“CARELESSNESS”
This is dedicated to my son 'John' and all men and women

375,Emotion,FearPoemsFearYeNotPoembyAngeloVentresco,"Fear ye not my wee one, fear ye not.
The dream you had was not for thee,
coming from a distant shore
a tempest wild blew it astray.
Fear ye not, for now a calm has come,
her bearings set, she has left your safe harbor,
to find one to her liking. Fear ye not not my wee
lass, fear ye not. Your Daddy's arms will
keep you safe from harm. So sleep ye now
my little one, for fear has gone...
Remember now what I say: For if you ever
have another soon it will go away;
Fear ye not..."
376,Emotion,FearPoemsNoFearPoembyleoconway,"I have no fear in death
I long for it
I find death for a child
Always looking for enjoyment
In what it kills
I have no fear in death
Death is what I can only see
But why, has it not come for me
It comes close but never comes for me
I have no fear in death
For death fears me"
377,Emotion,FearPoemsIHaveAFearIMayBeWrongPoembyMichaelShepherd,"I have a fear - I may be wrong:
that all too many, put off all thoughts of 'God'
by those who claim to speak for Him,
may cease to look for, name, all wondrous things:
the good, and beautiful, and truthful; which give joy;
which you and I love as the best of life...
and name them, praise them, to our children's ears
as all the wonder that they are...
I have a fear - I may be wrong:
that even seeing this world as sweetshop of delights
we never look to see
some unity.
I have a fear - I may be wrong:
that we may miss the mind's pure joy
of stepping back to see
beyond what shows itself,
a greater and more glorious view...
I have a fear - I may be wrong:
that though we have a hazy view
of 'Creation' and 'Creator',
we do not seek to play Creation's part -
as species disappear; as world pollutes...
I have a fear -I may be wrong:
we know the words; but miss the song."
378,Emotion,FearPoemsIDoNotFearToOwnMeKinPoembyRobertLouisStevenson,"I DO not fear to own me kin
To the glad clods in which spring flowers begin;
Or to my brothers, the great trees,
That speak with pleasant voices in the breeze,
Loud talkers with the winds that pass;
Or to my sister, the deep grass.
Of such I am, of such my body is,
That thrills to reach its lips to kiss.
That gives and takes with wind and sun and rain
And feels keen pleasure to the point of pain.
Of such are these,
The brotherhood of stalwart trees,
The humble family of flowers,
That make a light of shadowy bowers
Or star the edges of the bent:
They give and take sweet colour and sweet scent;
They joy to shed themselves abroad;
And tree and flower and grass and sod
Thrill and leap and live and sing
With silent voices in the Spring.
Hence I not fear to yield my breath,
Since all is still unchanged by death;
Since in some pleasant valley I may be,
Clod beside clod, or tree by tree,
Long ages hence, with her I love this hour;
And feel a lively joy to share
With her the sun and rain and air,
To taste her quiet neighbourhood
As the dumb things of field and wood,
The clod, the tree, and starry flower,
Alone of all things have the power."

Remember the wisdom out of the old days:

With the lonely, majestical multitude."
382,Emotion,FearPoemsAMothersFearPoembyTheresaAnnMoore,"A mother worries about the choices that her son may make.
She knows she has let him make decisions for his own sake.
As sirens scream, a mother sits in darkness choking back tears.
She prays that her boy is safe and calms her doubting fears.
At half past two, beams from headlights flood the driveway.
Relieved that he is home, she tiptoes to her bedroom right away.
She hears an urgent knocking and goes to turn on the porch light.
Patiently waiting at the door is a police officer; he is a somber sight."
383,Emotion,FearPoemsFearOfGettingToClosePoembytothosewhowonderwhatlifeisabout,"People choose to see what
they want in me
wanting to be my friend
seeking the knoweldge I
hold within from what
I have learned in school
and outside of school
Never really touching
what I am made up of on the inside
but if they ask, I tell them some
but nothing to deep
for I feel once they know
who I am on the inside
they will no longer be my friend
For they always want
people to know them inside and out
For me it takes either along time
or a very strong  conection between
me and that person
before I let them know
my deepest darkest secrets
that lay deep beneath my skin
with the hope that they will
still be my friend"
384,Emotion,FearPoemsTheFearOfBurialPoembyLouiseGluck,"In the empty field, in the morning,
the body waits to be claimed.
The spirit sits beside it, on a small rock--
nothing comes to give it form again.
Think of the body's loneliness.
At night pacing the sheared field,
its shadow buckled tightly around.
Such a long journey.
And already the remote, trembling lights of the village
not pausing for it as they scan the rows.
How far away they seem,
the wooden doors, the bread and milk
laid like weights on the table."
385,Emotion,FearPoemsFearOfLovePoembyMistyIacobucci,"Fear of Love
Have you ever loved someone so much that fear takes control of every emotions.
Fear of loving.
Fear of losing that felling of floating on air.
Fear of one day hearing the words…goodbye…
How can love & fear be twisted in one so that you can't even tell them apart.
Maybe, loving means risking everything for that one person who makes you feel larger then life.
I feel that with you, fear.
Fear of feelings I promised myself I would not feel again.
Fear of giving myself to be hurt again.
Fear of saying goodbye and never loving again.
Where do I go from here?
Do I let my fear of not being enough drive me away?
Do I let go now and let fear win?
Do I hold on and allow fear to drive you away?
Or do I hold on and shut fear out and know that real love will win?
Whatever path our love leads us down one thing I know is true.
Your love had made me realize what it is to love so much that fear takes control.
Whether that is good or bad remains to be seen.
Love knows no time, no place, and no fear.
We do that on our own.
We try to reason something, love, that had no reasoning about it.
Always from a far I saw you.
Until one day you were there with warmth in you face I could not refuse.
Now you are the man I dream of.
A fear I never expected when I looked at you.
A love that lit like a candle in a dark still room.
In one flash you lighted my heart with warmth and fear.
I do not know if fear of losing you will win.
Or if I have the strength to hold on and wait for our love to flourish into a lifetime of security and happiness.
The one thing I do know is that my fear of losing you is my heart admitting that there is a part of you I hold dear.
And that is the love I feel for you growing each day.
-Fear of Love-"

388,Emotion,FearPoemsFearOfTheInexplicablePoembyRainerMariaRilke,"But fear of the inexplicable has not alone impoverished
the existence of the individual; the relationship between
one human being and another has also been cramped by it,
as though it had been lifted out of the riverbed of
endless possibilities and set down in a fallow spot on the
bank, to which nothing happens. For it is not inertia alone
that is responsible for human relationships repeating
themselves from case to case, indescribably monotonous and
unrenewed: it is shyness before any sort of new,unforeseeable
experience with which one does not think oneself able to cope.
But only someone who is ready for everything, who excludes
nothing, not even the most enigmatical, will live the relation
to another as something alive and will himself draw exhaustively
from his own existence. For if we think of this existence of
the individual as a larger or smaller room, it appears evident
that most people learn to know only a corner of their room, a
place by the window, a strip of floor on which they walk up and
down. Thus they have a certain security. And yet that dangerous
insecurity is so much more human which drives the prisoners in
Poe's stories to feel out the shapes of their horrible dungeons
and not be strangers to the unspeakable terror of their abode.
We, however, are not prisoners. No traps or snares are set about
us, and there is nothing which should intimidate or worry us.
We are set down in life as in the element to which we best
correspond, and over and above this we have through thousands of
years of accommodation become so like this life, that when we
hold still we are, through a happy mimicry,scarcely to be
distinguished from all that surrounds us. We have no reason to
mistrust our world, for it is not against us. Has it terrors,
they are our terrors; has it abysses, those abuses belong to us;
are dangers at hand, we must try to love them. And if only we
arrange our life according to that principle which counsels us
that we must always hold to the difficult, then that which now
still seems to us the most alien will become what we most trust
and find most faithful. How should we be able to forget those
ancient myths about dragons that at the last moment turn into
princesses; perhaps all the dragons of our lives are princesses
who are only waiting to see us once beautiful and brave. Perhaps
everything terrible is in its deepest being something helpless
that wants help from us."
389,Emotion,FearPoemsFearIsWhatQuickensMePoembyJamesArlingtonWright,"1
Many animals that our fathers killed in America
Had quick eyes.
They stared about wildly,
When the moon went dark.
The new moon falls into the freight yards
Of cities in the south,
But the loss of the moon to the dark hands of Chicago
Does not matter to the deer
In this northern field.

What is that tall woman doing
There, in the trees?
I can hear rabbits and mourning dovees whispering together
In the dark grass, there
Under the trees.

390,Emotion,FearPoemsMidForestFearPoembyRodericQuinn,"SHE is standing at the gate,
Tall and sweet,
And although the hour be late
She will greet
Me, her lover,
Smiling over
Absent mind and tardy feet.
‘Rest,’ I’ll say to her, ‘and more rest,’
As she wraps her love around me,
And I’ll tell her of the forest,
Of the strange, fear-haunted forest
Where the fleshless beings found me.
For I trod a rock-strewn rude way
Thinking only of my lover,
When the moonlight on the woodway,
Made a weird-way of the woodway,
And a place where demons hover.
For the leaves that had been sleeping
On the sodden soil-bed lying,
Look a motion and ’gan creeping,
Like a thousand small feet creeping,
And there rose a distant sighing.
Why the trees did droop their tresses,
Weeping leaves for something under,
And what bode in dim recesses,
Feline-lurked in dim recesses,
Paled my cheeks and heart to ponder.
Had I feet I would have hurried,
But the moonlit forest chained me,
Soul and body grasped and worried,
With frost-fingers gripped and worried,
Till, half-stayed, my hurt heart pained me.…
‘Rest,’ I’ll say, ‘my Love, and more rest;
Things unseen have life and motion
And they haunt the moonlit forest—
Soul-affronting haunt the forest,
And men meet them on the ocean.’
She will look so grave and kind,
Saying ‘Rest—
Rest is here for heart and mind
On this breast—
Put aside all
Fancies idle,
I will shield you—Love is best.’"
391,Emotion,FearPoemsFearPoembyOldTeenagePoems,"I fear not of tomorrow
The dark scares me not
I am not full of sorrow
Although I've weeped a lot
What I fear is not on paper
There are no words big enough
I am not a hater
Although this world can be so tough
What I fear is much deeper
It is not simply cold or hot
What makes me a weeper
Is the fear of loosing all I've got
It's the fear of fear itself
That keeps me up at night
The fear of fear itself
Is what keeps happiness out of my sight
It's the fear of putting all plans on the shelf
That makes me afraid of loosing my very self
The fear of scaring away
Who I am inside
Is what makes me
So afraid I hide"

Can you be afraid of fear?
Am I hidding in the shadow of fear?
I can standup for myself but can't stand up to me
I'm scared of being scared
I want to find myself facing my fears
Diving head first into danger
But don't want to hesitate knowing,
fear itself might hold me back.
Grasping me tightly until I fear all that is known
Scared of dark corners, creaking noises.
All together I still fear, fear the most.

393,Emotion,FearPoemsFearTheFearPoembyChelseaHansford,"I fear the fear i cannot stop,
I fear it more and more,
And when i grind my teeth with pain,
The words come out demure.
I close my eyes with acid,
And dream while not asleep,
To confuse any enemys,
Anything i write i eat.
I fear the loss of loving,
But loving leads to pain,
So when im loving i admit,
I start to fear again.
I cry tears of happiness,
To pretend it isnt real,
I divulge no information,
On what is truely real.
I say sorry constantly,
It means nothing anymore,
Im sorry i cant be sincere,
Are you wanting more?
Would you like my fantasies,
To warp with truth and light,
Or can i keep them to myself,
So i can keep them warped inside?
I fear my sense of longing,
I turn me inside out,
My insides are much prettier,
Than the outsides ever felt.
So spit on me with poison,
Prove my worth is nil,
I dont fear your ignorance,
Its your clarity that kills.
Seek the maze of happiness,
And dont you chase you tail,
Dead ends lace every divide,
But no one can win or fail.
So fear the fear that i fear,
And see that all this mess,
Will not be sanitised with truth,
When you beg me to confess."

The cold black fear is clutching me to-night
As long ago when they would take the light
And leave the little child who would have prayed,
Frozen and sleepless at the thought of death.
My heart that beats too fast will rest too soon;
I shall not know if it be night or noon, --
Yet shall I struggle in the dark for breath?
Will no one fight the Terror for my sake,
The heavy darkness that no dawn will break?
How can they leave me in that dark alone,
Who loved the joy of light and warmth so much,
And thrilled so with the sense of sound and touch, --
How can they shut me underneath a stone?"

I spotted
my favorite crazy person
talking to himself

to hear what he said.
“I wanna see
what’s on both sides

in his nasal twang
then marched
like a soldier
forging ahead
in battle
across the street
looked around
and returned
only to repeat, “I wanna see
what’s on both sides
of the street.”

stride across asphalt

the intense search
at last
returning to his starting point
eight times repeated
when I cried out

Another drink, can’t find my smokes
Always wanting more from fire,
To much rebellion from my folk’s.
It’s hard to drink and not to care,
It’s hard to climb the loving stairs.
It’s hard to feel my love break through
Just never felt it much from you.
It’s a hardened life
In cold and pain,
It’s a lonely faith,
I feel the same.
Don’t ask me why I have to write,
So many told me “Girl, just fight”
With the inspiration flooding through,
Spilling and drowning in it’s flight.
So leave me be,
You’re not my foe,
You’re another fear,
That I don’t know."

στέρησέ μου τον αέρα, μα
μη μου στερείς το χαμόγελό σου.
Μη μου παίρνεις μακρυά μου το τριαντάφυλλο,

τη δροσιά που ξάφνου
στάζει μες τη χαρά σου,
το ξαφνικό πάντα  ασημένιο κύμα
που γεννήθηκ' εντός σου.

κηλίδες το αίμα μου

Γέλα τη νύχτα,
τη μέρα, στο φεγγάρι,
γέλα στους έλικες
σοκκάκια του νησιού,
γέλα σε τούτο τ' αδέξιο αγόρι
που σ' αγαπά.
Μα σαν ανοίγω

όταν ξεκινούν τα βήματά μου,
όταν επιστρέφουν τα βήματά μου,
αρνήσου μου ψωμί, αγέρα,
φως, πηγή,
μα ποτέ το χαμόγελό σου
γιατί θα πέθαινα."

To everyone, this is well known,
But now-a-days, it's rarely seen
'Cause of more stress and strain.
In the good olden days,
There were royal ways,
For a king's laughter,
Got thro' a Court Jester.
To a Joker's club,
Or a Theatre pub,
One has to go today,
For buying one's joy.
Anger leads one to tension,
And laughter to relaxation,
But still why one chooses frustration,
Paying health a little attention?
It's said, 'An apple a day
Keeps the doctor away, '
Why a free-laugh, daily one can't try,
Rather going for an apple to buy?
This way one can be happy,
To lead a long life healthy,
And can grow further wealthy,
No more medicines, no more worry."

It gives your brain a tickle!
It brings a lotto happiness,
You've gotto have a giggle!
Don't hold it back! Let it be free!
Roll on the floor as well!
Then other folks will laugh with glee -
And think it's wonderfell...
Children are known to laugh the most -
They've learnt to tell jokes, too...
With limericks from coast-to-coast
To get the message through!
Yes, laughter lifts the lungs like songs...
Thus tensions melt away...
That's why all comics should get gongs
When honours are given in May...
If I get knighted, as it were,
The day I leave The Mall,
Be kind enough to call me, SIR!
Not Mister, mate or pal!
All wise-cracks pour from lightning brains
That see life's ironies,
Sifting out truths from lies like grains
With food for thought to please!
I'd like to think that humour spreads
Like smiles as joy imparts.
Some jokes are like fine thoroughbreds -
They're trained to thrill our hearts!
Blessed is the soul that's learnt to laugh
Yet cares for other folks -
It proves a noble epitaph
That one was known for jokes!
A precious pun's not always cute!
But sometimes it's OK...
So do your best to be astute!
You'll make somebody's day!"
405,Emotion,LaughterPoemsLaughterPoembychandrathiagarajan,"Laughter  is  a  unique  quality  endowed  to  mankind;
It  is  completely  denied  to  the  animal  mind.
When  humour  is  dwelt  upon  and  reared,
There   emanates  laughter  and  is  shared.
Roaring   laughter  is  contagious,
And  humour  is  surely  infectious.
Laughter   escalates  hilarity  and  happiness,
And  humour  diminishes  weariness.
One  can  laugh  at  a  joke,  ridiculous,
And  can  scoff  at  another  one,  meticulous.
One  needs  to be  like  a  child,  so  jolly,
Egoless  and  innocent  to laugh  so  merrily.
Laughter  requires  a  bit  of  intelligence,
As  well  as  presence  of  mind  and  good  sense.
Benefits  of  laughter  are  numerous,
It  bestows  a  wealth  of  health  on  us.
Laughter  boosts  the  immunity  system,
And  lowers  the  stress  hormone  item.
With  laughter  the  whole  body  is  relaxed,
And  gnawing  pain  for  a  time  is  axed.
Laughter  prevents  even  the  heart  disease,
And  a  sorrowful  mood  is  made  to  ease.
With  a  chuckle  feel-good  endorphins  are  released,
And  with  a  peal  of  laughter  one  is  pleased.
Laughter  adds  joy  and  zest  to  life,
And  eases  anxiety,  fear  and  strife.
Laughter  helps  conflicts  to  diffuse,
And  mirth  in  one   it  does  suffuse.
Laughter  is  a  resource  for  problem  surmounting,
And  has  the  power  for  good  relationship  enhancing.
Humour  lightens  one's  burdens;
Inspires  hope  and  the  outlook  broadens.
So  let  us  enjoy  humour  and  guffaw  heartily,
And  let  us  blend  laughter  into  our  lives  verily."

Sound of woods at sundawn stirred,
Welling water's winsome word,
Wind in warm wan weather,
One thing yet there is, that none
Hearing ere its chime be done
Knows not well the sweetest one
Heard of man beneath the sun,
Hoped in heaven hereafter;
Soft and strong and loud and light,
Very sound of very light
Heard from morning's rosiest height,
When the soul of all delight
Fills a child's clear laughter.
Golden bells of welcome rolled
Never forth such notes, nor told
Hours so blithe in tones so bold,
As the radiant mouth of gold
Here that rings forth heaven.
If the golden-crested wren
Were a nightingale---why, then,
Something seen and heard of men
Might be half as sweet as when
Laughs a child of seven."
408,Emotion,LaughterPoemsIBurstIntoLaughterPoembyKabir,"I burst into laughter
whenever I hear
that the fish is thirsty in water.
Without the knowledge of Self
people just wander to Mathura or to Kashi
like the musk-deer unaware
of the scent in his navel,
goes on running forest to forest.
In water is the lotus plant
and the plant bears flowers
and on the flowers are the bees buzzing.
Likewise all yogis and mendicants
and all those who have renounced comforts,
are on here and hereafter and the nether world -
contemplating.
Friend, the Supreme Indestructible Being,
on whom thousands of sages meditate
and even Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh,
really resides within one's self.
Though He is near, He appears far away -
and that is what makes one disturbed;
says Kabir, listen, O wise one,
by Guru alone is the confusion curbed."

410,Emotion,LaughterPoemsLoveLaughterAndYouPoembyHarryJCouchonJr,"Three things that make my life complete
Are love, laughter, and you,  my sweet
The laughter has lasted since day one
Loving you darling, has been so much fun
Whether it's giggles at the kitchen table
Or all out laughter wherever we're able
Each and every laugh, a symbol of our love
You're my everything, all I ever drempt  of
Our love, now that's a bit more serious
Shining through when our laughter is delirious
Starting the day with love's tenderness
Saying goodnight with a sweet caress
Love, laughter, and of course you.
You bring into my life the other two
From the day we met, and for every single day
Love and laughter in our lives will stay"

412,Emotion,LaughterPoemsLaughterAndDeathPoembyWilfridScawenBlunt,"THERE is no laughter in the natural world
Of beast or fish or bird, though no sad doubt
Of their futurity to them unfurled
Has dared to check the mirth-compelling shout.
The lion roars his solemn thunder out
To the sleeping woods. The eagle screams her cry.
Even the lark must strain a serious throat
To hurl his blest defiance at the sky.
Fear, anger, jealousy, have found a voice.
Love’s pain or rapture the brute bosoms swell.
Nature has symbols for her nobler joys,
Her nobler sorrows. Who had dared foretell
That only man, by some sad mockery,
Should learn to laugh who learns that he must die?"
413,Emotion,LaughterPoemsJointLaughterPoembyErnestineNorthover,"We laugh at the same funny things,
Our quick sense of humour just springs
From being together,
Whatever the weather,
It's wonderful what such laughter brings.
We can each see the funny side, that's true,
But of course we can sometimes be blue,
But if one of us is down,
Then the others a clown
Enticing a smile to break through.
Sometimes, when we're both very tired,
And we feel that we're electrically wired,
Something just makes us smile,
And after a while,
We can laugh, which is just what's required.
I won't say there's not sadness in life,
But try looking beyond all the strife,
We keep smiling along,
Till the sadness has gone,
That's the delight of being 'husband and wife'.

415,Emotion,LaughterPoemsYourLaughterPoembyPabloNeruda,"Take bread away from me, if you wish,
take air away, but
do not take from me your laughter.
Do not take away the rose,
the lance flower that you pluck,
the water that suddenly
bursts forth in joy,
the sudden wave
of silver born in you.
My struggle is harsh and I come back
with eyes tired
at times from having seen
the unchanging earth,
but when your laughter enters
it rises to the sky seeking me
and it opens for me all
the doors of life.
My love, in the darkest
hour your laughter
opens, and if suddenly
you see my blood staining
the stones of the street,
laugh, because your laughter
will be for my hands
like a fresh sword.
Next to the sea in the autumn,
your laughter must raise
its foamy cascade,
and in the spring, love,
I want your laughter like
the flower I was waiting for,
the blue flower, the rose
of my echoing country.
Laugh at the night,
at the day, at the moon,
laugh at the twisted
streets of the island,
laugh at this clumsy
boy who loves you,
but when I open
my eyes and close them,
when my steps go,
when my steps return,
deny me bread, air,
light, spring,
but never your laughter
for I would die."

We drenched the altars of Love's sacred grove,
Shaking to earth green fruits, impatient after
The launching of the colored moths of Love.
Love's proper myrtle and his mother's zone
We bound about our irreligious brows,
And fettered him with garlands of our own,
And spread a banquet in his frugal house.
Not yet the god has spoken; but I fear
Though we should break our bodies in his flame,
And pour our blood upon his altar, here
Henceforward is a grove without a name,
A pasture to the shaggy goats of Pan,
Whence flee forever a woman and a man."

to the Halls of Injustice
and the false evidence burns
to a beautiful white lightness
It rattles the Chambers of Congress
and forces the windows wide open
so the fatuous speeches can fly out
The laughter of women wipes the mist
from the spectacles of the old;
it infects them with a happy flu
and they laugh as if they were young again
Prisoners  held in underground cells
imagine that they see daylight
when they remember the laughter of women
It runs across water that divides,
and reconciles two unfriendly shores
like flares that signal the news to each other
What a language it is, the laughter of women,
high-flying and subversive.
Long before law and scripture
we heard the laughter, we understood freedom."

I crave the opening of your lips
the agreement between your smile and your tears

the melodies of your finger tips

I crave your eyes, your laughter, and your touch

Our life gets ensconced between our
laughter and tears,
With sunshine and rain, between our
joys and fears!
This life is a filigree of light and shadow
play,
While with our laughter we try  to drive
our fears away!
All our exalted emotions, bring tears to our
eyes,
But tears can flow freely, while laughter
needs tears to survive!
Laugh and the world laughs with you,
But when you weep, you weep alone!
The world has no time for your sorrow, -
it remains as your  very own!
Life’s music is composed with our happiness
and pain,
Tears provide the somber background notes,
And laughter the lilting cadence of summer’s rain!
But in this single life, if we can wipe our brother's
tears,
Happiness will follow, to drive away our tears!

He lifts his bare head from the ground;
He listens through the gloom around:
The winds have brought him a strange sound
Of distant merrymaking.
Comes now the Peace so long delayed?
Is it the cheerful voice of Aid?
Begins the time his heart has prayed,
When men may reap and sow?
Ah, God!  Back to the cold earth's breast!
The sages chuckle o'er their jest;
Must they, to give a people rest,
Their dainty wit forego?
The tyrants sit in a stately hall;
They jibe at a wretched people's fall;
The tyrants forget how fresh is the pall
Over their dead and ours.
Look how the senators ape the clown,
And don the motley and hide the gown,
But yonder a fast-rising frown
On the people's forehead lowers."

Original Poem by Pablo Neruda
Hindi translation by Rajnish Manga
हँसी तुम्हारी
मूल कविता: पेब्लो नेरुदा
हिंदी अनुवाद: रजनीश मंगा
यदि चाहो तुम, मुझसे मेरा दानापानी ले लो
ले लो मुझसे पवन झकोरे
किंतु न ले लेना हरगिज़ मुझसे अपनी हँसी सलोनी.
यह गुलाब न मुझसे छीनो,
कंदराओं में उगने वाला नीला फूल जो तोड़ा तुमने,
इस कोशिश में कुछ जल के छींटे
अकस्मात् हर्षोन्माद में मुझे भिगो कर चले गये हैं,
तभी अचानक तुम्हारे तन से
लहर उठी थी रजत कणों की..
संघर्षों से व्यथित हुआ लौट आया हूँ
बोझिल नयन लिये अपने मैं
यूँ ही इक टक तकते रहने से
धरती की बदलावहीनता,
किंतु जब जब हँसीं तुम्हारी मंडराती है
नभ की ओर मुझे ढूँढने को जाती है
और खुल जाते हैं मेरे वास्ते
जीवन के अनगिनत रास्ते.
प्रिये सुनो, अंधकार हो सघन जिस घड़ी
हँसी तुम्हारी
खिल उठती है, और यदि अचानक
तुम देखो जो मेरे रक्त से
सनी हुई बजरी सड़क पर,
हँसो, क्योंकि यह हँसी तुम्हारी
मेरे हाथों में दिखेगी ऐसे
नई खड़ग की चमक हो जैसे.
पतझड़ में सागर से आगे,
हँसी तुम्हारी ऊपर जाकर
फ़ेनिल झरने सी गिरती है,
और वसंत के मौसम में, प्रिय,
मुझे तुम्हारी हँसी चाहिए फूल सरीखी
इंतज़ार था जिसका मुझको,
एक नीला फूल, एक गुलाब उस देश का
जिसमें मैं गुंजायमान हूँ.
हँसो रात पर,
और दिवस पर, और चाँद पर,
हँसो हँसो उन टेढ़े मेढ़े
टापू के गलियारों पर,
हँसो हँसो बेढंगे से इस
लड़के पर, जो है केवल तुम्हें चाहता,
लेकिन जब खोलूं मैं
आँखें अपनी या पलकों को बंद करूँ,
जब भी मेरे कदम बढ़ें,
या क़दमों को वापस लूँ,
दानापानी, हवा छीन लो
रोशनी, मधुमास छीन लो
छीनो अपनी हँसी न मुझसे
सच कहता हूँ मर जाऊँगा.
सच कहता हूँ मर जाऊँगा."

432,Emotion,LaughterPoemsTheLaughterTherapyPoembyRAJNANDY,"THE LAUGHTER THERAPY
(I)
Every morning the ritual is the same, -
I say my prayers and take His name;
As I settle down to read the papers, –
About our politician’s famous ‘blame game’!
It is then I always hear, loud peals of laughter
from our adjacent park,
A man dedicated to laughter therapy,
With his loud guffaw and reverberating bark!
Trying to resolve this laughing mystery, -
I read several articles about Laughter Therapy!
(II)
Amongst all created things and living beings,
Man alone suffers deeply in his body, mind,
and soul;
With peals of laughter he must suppress his tears,
To balance this life and control!
Yet during those rare and supreme happy moments
of  life, -
Tears are seen to well-up in our eyes!
Laughter gets mingled with our tears, -
I wonder why? !
Perhaps laughter and tears are two sides,
Of the same coin of our worldly life!
While our lacrymal glands perform this feat, -
As laughter and tears join hands  to make this
life complete!
(III)
While hearty, non-ridiculing and connecting
laughter does provide,
Physiological, psychological and spiritual
benefits - on hindsight!
Laughter brings a twinkle in our eyes, destroying
our conservative reputation;
Improving our cardiovascular flexibility, increasing
our spiritual quotient!
Laughter like internal jogging, gives us an internal
massaging;
Performed both silently and rapidly beyond imagining!
Revitalizing those unexplored internal crannies –
all automatic!
Far better than all our know antibiotics!
Laughter a tranquilizer without side effects,
Releases our pent-up tension relaxing us instead!
(IV)
An optimist always laughs to forget, while a pessimist
forgets to laugh,
My man in the park is perhaps an optimist,
Who has embraced this  therapy as an art!
Or perhaps that man laughs daily at the frailties of a
meaningless life,
In this life of absurdities as he adapts himself to
survive!
This laughter therapy is a tranquilizer both healthy
and free,
Perhaps that man in the park is laughing at both you
and me!
Our life becomes a tragedy for those who only feel!
But a comedy of laughter, if you pause a while to think!
So let us try to make others laugh while we try to
control our tears,
Laughing is a healing process and drives away our
fears!
Let us make a New Year’s resolution, making laughter
our altruistic mission;
Coupled with a loving and caring heart all true, -
Let this  laughter as a therapy - benefit both me and
you!

434,Emotion,LaughterPoemsWhenTheLaughterStopsPoembyMatthewHolloway,"When the laughter stops
~
And what when the laughter stops
Do we care to ask
Those clowns and entertainers
Once the curtain has fallen
Is there still joy, rhapsody
Or the emptiness of a still room
Do they cry or call for help
What happens when the laughter stops
It's not a question I hear often
But is a relevant as the time of day
Were the world indeed a stage
And we each designated a role to play
Those jesters how we love them so
In their masks and acts
What happens when the laughter stops
Still we do not ask"
435,Emotion,LaughterPoemsLaughterPoembyConradPotterAiken,"You, whom these eyes, no longer mine,
Shall see in the mirror's flash and shine,
Meagre of face and pale of cheek,
Pale mouth, and lines that sadness speak:
All the grey shipwreck of this me
Who look upon you and laugh for glee,
Mocking at you, poor feeble thing,
You word that's uttered, you tune that's played,
You body shrunken, you soul decayed,
You heart that whispers but cannot sing:
You, when you walk abroad in sun,
Blinking at last for the too much light,
Scorning the young life that can run,
Scorning the fierce life that can fight,
And drooling wisdom day by day,
Presuming, you, to point the way:
Here are my eyes upon you, now,
Colder than stars to sear your brow,
Here is my hand upon your hand,
A stronger grip than yours can stand,
Here are my words, so cruelly true,-
If you be false, they are stones for you ...
And because you are feeble, a crawling thing,
Walking by walls to hold and cling,
With terror of darkness on your breath,
And terror lest you be dead, with death:
Catching perhaps at straws of faith,
Drunk with religion in hope to drown
These maddening truths that will not down,
Clutching philosophy's vapid wraith:
Here is my perfect scorn for you,
The scorn from youth to old age due,
Merciless laughter, sharp as knife,
The egotistical laugh of life.
I hold my sides!- let truth be said,
'Twere better if things like you were dead.
For I have strength to face this earth,
I am risen warm and strong from birth,
I am song, I am love, I am bitter hate,
The laughter of speed that will not wait.
Nature is hard, but hard am I,
The hard will live, the soft must die:
And I who am nature know this truth,-
The soul of nature's soul is youth.
If you deny me, turn to shame,
Or pity me,- forego my name;
For youth is right, and age is wrong-
You but a prayer, while I am song!
The weak hates strong: you will hate me,
And war upon me, with cunning wiles,-
Pity me, with indulgent smiles,
And shrug your shoulders paternally.
'Mad youth!' you'll murmur- 'how mad it is!
He must indulge his ecstasies!
Youth is a madness, it will pass,
The fever of blood, the mad blind eyes-
His stars will burn him, he'll grow wise,
The years bring calm to lad and lass.
And what we thought so fine in youth
Was at the most but half of truth,-
For truth is not of youth or age,
But some of life's whole pilgrimage,-
The young men's visions, the old men's dreams,
The passion of days, the thought of years;
Age's cautions, and youth's extremes;
Laughter is life no more than tears.
Youth sings, 'the height of life is youth,
All after that is retrograde,
The music falters, the flowers fade,
And falsehood masquerades as truth.'
Youth sings, 'Age hath no right to speak,
Nature abhors him, he is weak,
But youth is right, for youth is strong,
Youth is the young earth's bridal-song!'
I was a young man once, myself,
Youth, I can sympathize with you;
I speak impartially from my shelf-
Truth lies half way between the two.
Youth scorns old age,- well, youth is right,
That is youth's nature; age scorns youth,
Age too is just; each sees the light
As nature grants, and each sees truth...
For truth is not of youth or age,
But sum of life's whole pilgrimage,
A wonder of many wonders wrought,
Blended of passion and of thought;
And so, young man, we'll compromise-
Each of us, in our way, is wise!'
Thus you will speak, O cunning one,
Warming your cold hands in the sun;
Squinting your eyes in too bright light,
Shielding your face's sickly white.
However weak, life fends for self,-
Thus you, old ghost! you shuffling trimmer!
You speak impartially from your shelf?-
You clutch at rays, for the light grows dimmer.
This much I'll not begrudge you, then-
Go, justify yourself to men,
With powers of darkness come to terms
Lest you turn sick with dread of worms.
But, for the hard work of my brain,
Hands off! your yellow hands would stain.
Our best work, youth's! one finger mars;
If you must loathe it, or disclaim,
I beg you, then, forego my name,-
Else, die, mid laughter from the stars!
And yet, what's life? Come, here's my hand.
For at the last, I see it well,
Age were not age unless it fell,
And crawls- because it cannot stand.
I pity you,- I laugh at you,-
Yet to your years I see you true,
Truer than if, with rigid thought,
Your age to ghost of youth you wrought.
Poor soul! go, make your peace with death,
And warm your heart with a shibboleth!
Yes, you will hate, despise my work,-
How else?- But here's my laughing dirk,
Here I have snared you, all complete,
Your pitiful pale hands, struggling feet;
If you breathe poison on my art
Here is my poniard, here your heart!...
Because you are aged, senile, lamed,
For this, man, you shall not be blamed,
Though youth must smirk old age to see,
And merriment bubbles up in me;
But if with hand that smears and mars
You touch our best work, yours and mine,-
Then comes my laughter from earth and stars,
Youthful and cruel, wild, divine!"
436,Emotion,LaughterPoemsLaughterPoembyRobertWilliamService,"I Laugh at Life: its antics make for me a giddy games,
Where only foolish fellows take themselves with solemn aim.
I laugh at pomp and vanity, at riches, rank and pride;
At social inanity, at swager, swank and side.
At poets, pastry-cooks and kings, at folk sublime and small,
Who fuss about a thousand things that matter not at all;
At those who dream of name and fame, at those who scheme for pelf. . . .
But best of all the laughing game - is laughing at myself.
Some poet chap had labelled man the noblest work of God:
I see myself a charlatan, a humbug and a fraud.
Yea, 'spite of show and shallow wit, an sentimental drool,
I know myself a hypocrite, a coward and a fool.
And though I kick myself with glee profoundly on the pants,
I'm little worse, it seems to me, than other human ants.
For if you probe your private mind, impervious to shame,
Oh, Gentle Reader, you may find you're much about the same.
Then let us mock with ancient mirth this comic, cosmic plan;
The stars are laughing at the earth; God's greatest joke is man.
For laughter is a buckler bright, and scorn a shining spear;
So let us laugh with all our might at folly, fraud and fear.
Yet on our sorry selves be spent our most sardonic glee.
Oh don't pay life a compliment to take is seriously.
For he who can himself despise, be surgeon to the bone,
May win to worth in others' eyes, to wisdom in his own."

It’s good for your health.
And pausing to laugh

One cannot avoid laughter throughout his life
The individual who is incapable to laugh in such feelings
That makes the mind in humor and happiest and best of moods
May be somewhat wrong in his mindset so says the learnt ones
Laughter a perfect  mechanism and outlet to vanish tension
Stresses and strains of human feelings we have to avoid
So laugh so much when you feel it good and in such mind
No one is bothered to question your freedom of laughter
But always keep the laughing with pure awareness
Without making negative feelings to the nearer ones
The most successful men of world leaders and intellectuals
Were capable to laugh in good spirit and making other happy
The secrecy behind their success being the laughter
Follow their ways of tendencies of expressions of laughter
The real success will be to you no doubt remember."

I see people befuddled,
looking utterly lost.
they are wandering around aimlessly,
or rooted to the spot
like a deer caught in headlights.
No joke makes me laugh uncontrollably.
Yes, I may guffaw, I may laugh -
but uncontrollable laughter,
deep purging,
healing laughter,
happens  very-very seldom in my life.
But it happened in my last  dance.
I was convulsed with laughter -
convulsed is the only correct word.
How often, in life, are you convulsed in laughter? -
and of course, being convulsed,
I was clogging up the middle,
causing further confusion."
442,Emotion,LaughterPoemsLaughterPoembyRebekahGamble,"I buried your heart
one fine spring day
and planted
a sighing rose
above it.
Perhaps some
would water it
with tears and fragments
of memories and sorrow,
but not I.
Pain is but trickery
and loss but a product.
What tears have I
for passing time?
Fearlessness is my virtue
and laughter my answer.
I am twilight
and my eyes are twinkling.
I buried your heart
one fine spring day
and planted
a sighing rose
above it.
My heart turns to stone;
it serves as a marker for you.
Fear not,
for it is time."
443,Emotion,LaughterPoemsTheSoundOfLaughterPoembyFrancisDuggan,"The sound of laughter is a thing of beauty for laughter spreads the very gift of joy
That people they are drawn to happy people is not that hard for to understand why
Since everybody wishes to be happy and laughter it spreads happiness around
And only the heartless could not like the sound of laughter for laughter is a very happy sound,
Than laughter there is no more happy feeling laugh and the World laughs with you seems so true
But if you feel sad and for yourself feeling sorry the saddest person in the World is you
Even your friends would rather not be with you if they see you as one who worship gloom
The happy people attract people to them and in their presence happiness does bloom,
The sound of laughter sends out laughter ripples it is a sound one always loves to hear
And laughter it gives rise to smiling faces and never fails to fill the cup of cheer
The sad one who feels comfort in self pity is the one others do not wish to know
But if you are one who laughs away your worries your friends in numbers seem to grow and grow
And who could not but love the sound of laughter to it there always is a joyful ring
It seems to send happiness out in ripples it is a joyful and infectious thing."
444,Emotion,LaughterPoemsLaughterACurePoembybriefrenderingsJoeFazio,"I believe, in placing ones family first.
I believe that many successful people,
leave in their path, countless orphans
of success.
I believe, when the sickness is sadness,
laughter is the cure.
I believe, that a good work ethic, can
serve all of us well.
I believe in good wine and good friends.
I believe, in a time each day, to give thanks.
I believe in forgiveness.
I believe, if one can forgive a friend,
then surely, one can forgive family.
I believe in the power of the written word.
I still believe in hand written letters.
I believe the first cup of coffee in the

448,Emotion,LaughterPoemsLaughterPoembyJohnKendrickBangs,"WORRY stalked along the road,
Trouble sneaking after;
Then Black Care, and Grief, and Goad
Enemies to Laughter.
But old Laughter with a shout
Rose up and attacked 'em;
Put the sorry pack to rout,
Walloped *em and whacked 'em.
Laughter frivols day and night ;
Sometimes he's a bubble,
But he hath a deal of might
In a bout with Trouble!"
449,Emotion,LaughterPoemsEvilLaughterPoembyRobertSmith,"On thing I admire, nay two things
always strike me as admirable:
The way evil characters always
laugh with total happy abandon
About their plots to overthrow the
world, and the way they always
love their cats, mostly white with
blue eyes – given the importance
Of joyous laughter in our lives,
people having pets living longer,
healthy lives - this phenomenon
is deserving of attention
I am thinking of a scheme to overthrow
the world so I can throw back my head
to laugh long and hard and happily,
Hollywood has this down pat
By making villains keep taped laughter
in a box – preferably on a wheel-chair’s
side  – as villains are mostly sitting there,
having lost a limb or two
They turn it on for special effect upon
pronouncing their next evil event – luckily
my cell-phone announces incoming messages
with a bout of hysterical laughter
I always irritate my wife by laughing along; the
cat I already have, an evil creature, trying to
scratch me whenever I pass - I’m sure to
enjoy all the advantages of evil
Laughter; keeping an arch-villain cat as the
basis of the evil plot that is my life!"
450,Emotion,LaughterPoemsDaughtersTheSoftnessAndLaughterOfAHomePoembysaadattahir,"Daughters are in ways proverbial gypsies.
Content an playful in their itsy bitsys.
The skip, the hop,
Wicker basket, off to shop.
Feel like the waft of calming breeze.
Wide eyed look when you sneeze.
Tender touch of a flower on cheek.
Your loving nod yearn to seek.
Add so much color to life,
forget you all the anguish, strife.
Vivacious laughter thrills.
The nooks an crannies fills.
Your heart and soul bloom.
Wash away your gloom.
They the tender shoots of today.
In time shall bloom another day.
Bring forth flowers of the morrows.
To slake the torment of your sorrows.
And one day late in evening shadows.
Amid song, dance and the meadows.
They go their way.
Far away.
To a new abode, a better place.
To lend a cheer, to give solace.
Leave the stark an silence behind.
For you to find.
Only the stars to guide you by.
Awake in bed as you lie!

451,Emotion,LaughterPoemsWeNeedSomeLaughterInOurLivesPoembyFrancisDuggan,"We need some laughter in our lives since laughter makes us happy
I know this bloke he never smiles like baby with wet nappy
He always seems so close to tears for him I do feel pity
Financially well to do and spiritually poor many like him in this City
With a lovely school going daughter and a beautiful wife he ought to feel lighthearted
But happinness out of his life 'twould seem has long departed
A millionaire many times over his business it is thriving
But about him he has the sad look of one barely surviving
He needs some laughter in his life since by laughter he's forsaken
Without laughter happiness sleeps on and never does awaken
Materially wealthy but spiritually poor he always looks sad and lonely
But such is life as some do say and he is not the only
Wealthy person for to feel this way for him I feel some pity
For he is a poor man in some ways one of many in this City."
452,Emotion,LaughterPoemsToHearYourLaughterPoembyAdrienneGagne,"Just to hear your laughter,
I would throw myself off the highest cliff
on the western coast
And as the waves carried my broken body away
I would turn my head back in your direction
Because after everything we have been through,
The pain
The tears
The sacrifices
The goodbyes
I need to know that you will always be laughing
Right before the ocean pulls me below the surface for good
The wind catches the faint sound of your voice
You are laughing so hard
I can practically picture the tears of joy
streaming down your face.
Darkness follows
and there is nothing left but a broken body filled with memories
Finally, amidst the saltwater and seaweed
You are free,
and so am I."

was his name,
being jolly
his claim to fame-
He'd laugh at this
he'd laugh at that,
he'd laugh from his boots
up to his hat-
From the day of his birth
he'd always laugh and smile,
to hear or tell a joke
he'd gladly walk a mile-
No news was too bad
no opinion too sour,
his joy was unbreakable
hour upon hour-
That is until the fateful day when he laughed
at his wife in her new dress,
now poor Joe cannot even offer up a smile...
his broken teeth are such a mess-"

All the world's a holiday!
Laugh away, and roar and shout
Till thy hoarse tongue lolleth out!
Bloat thy cheeks, and bulge thine eyes
Unto bursting; pelt thy thighs
With thy swollen palms, and roar
As thou never hast before!

Stiflest? Squat and grind thy heel--
Wrestle with thy loins, and then
Wheeze thee whiles, and whoop again!"

Makes a lighter load to carry
Of the burdens we face..
If there is also a little laughter."

floating out of

- - - - - - - - - - -
The show must go on;
And so is our life
With laughter
It always shines
Youth comes to age
Without much strife
And it’s laughter
That makes life’s pilgrimage
Better and steadier
The flower fades
The music breaks
And the falsehood masquerades
But the laughter stays and invigorates
Life youthful and divine with grace
With laughter heart-aches disappear
And minds free from stress and fear
See a flower with laughter
Always happy and happier
A butterfly upon a flower
A cloud in the sky
While dissolving in showers
And a wave in sea splashing the shore
And the laughter with us
Dissolving in happiness more
And shall endeavour
To make life mightier and healthier
Oh soul, laugh and be merry
For that’s the golden way
Life can be lived sweeter and stronger..........."

Lost amid his laughter"
462,Emotion,LaughterPoemsTheJoyOfTheirLaughterPoembyFrancisDuggan,"The children are playing football in the park off of the street
The joy in their laughter it does sound so sweet
'Tis true youth is such a marvellous thing
Like the flowers of the fields that bloom lovely in Spring.
The joy of their laughter bring back memories to me
Of happy boyhood days of any cares free
In the Town park on Summer evenings we kicked the football
Such wonderful memories are good to recall
The years went so quickly and time did not wait
And I've grown grayer and slower and I'm putting on weight
The future belongs to the youth of today
Though they too will grow to learn that time quickly ticks away.
Some of those I went to school with now with the dead lay
And some are grand parents and their grand children play
The games they themselves played they run up and down
In pursuit of the football in the park by the Town.
As I walk to the bottle shop for to buy beer
The laughter of the children playing football I hear
Their best days approaching and mine in the past
But time keeps on ticking and nothing does last."
463,Emotion,LaughterPoemsSmileWithLaughterPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"Cheerful sound with big sound is called laugh
You energy is consumed almost half
Worries and tension disappear altogether
It has nothing to do with any whether
It is good medicine for incurable diseases
Person suffers from pain and continues to decease
Good laugh provides him easy means to live
All worries and tension remain to be relieved
Good laugh always pleases others
It doesn’t affect others or bother
It is considered as God’s gift
It helps to remove even old rift
Have you ever witnessed child’s smile?
You continue to enjoy for a while
Friendship may grow with smiling gesture
It may end up with bright future
You must try to live with laugh and learn
You may be miles away from concern
Laugh it out when you are in crisis
Stretch it out more and lay an emphasis
You are not to be driven out by any count
Let there be any difficulties or pressure mount
You may continue to live at ease
Smile may help worries to decrease
You may roar high in laughter
Your heart beats may run even faster
All vanes and brain may have fresh supply
Body need may meet the level with good reply
It is equally important for good health
Nothing can compensate even more wealth
So laugh even when it is not needed
Medical advice may always be heeded
Worry and tension burn body from within
Chances for recovery are then very thin
One must live by what he is supposed
Health must prevail and rest all is disposed
Good smile may pave the way for adjustment
Life may become easy with smiling comments
Any excuses offered without remorse may not have effect
Sorry with broad smile may have desirable affect
You can find good partner if good smile is offered
Smile may reliever you from burden even if you have suffered
You can win away foe with mild gesture
It may then decide good and durable future
Love to live with smile and not with tension
Never open up with caution and mention
It is momentary thing and may pass off
Be little lenient with views and very soft
You may live little longer than expected
You may enhance the position and remain respected
It is advisable to remain always in joyous mood
You may need nothing not even rich food
Love to live with smile and advent
Not to feel bad and offer any comment
Leave behind trail of long laughter
You may feel happy and even lighter"
464,Emotion,LaughterPoemsTheirMeaninglessLaughterPoembysarwarchowdhury,"The other day I had had, The smell of spellbound emitted from her love, That made me sorrowful and as a dead man later on, But the blooming flowers were laughing and told at last- 'You  are in a state of being intoxicated...try to get out of obsession.'

Do you know that scientist Einstein were fall in love too?
They again laugh and laugh, Meaningless laughter.

465,Emotion,LaughterPoemsMomusGodOfLaughterPoembyEllaWheelerWilcox,"Though with gods the world is cumbered,
Gods unnamed, and gods unnumbered,
Never god was known to be
Who had not his devotee.
So I dedicate to mine,
Here in verse, my temple-shrine.
‘Tis not Ares, - mighty Mars,
Who can give success in wars.
‘Tis not Morpheus, who doth keep
Guard above us while we sleep,
‘Tis not Venus, she whose duty
‘Tis to give us love and beauty;
Hail to these, and others, after
Momus, gleesome god of laughter.
Quirinus would guard my health,
Plutus would insure me wealth;
Mercury looks after trade,
Hera smiles on youth and maid.
All are kind, I own their worth,
After Momus, god of mirth.
Though Apollo, out of spite,
Hides away his face of light,
Though Minerva looks askance,
Deigning me no smiling glance,
Kings and queens may envy me
While I claim the god of glee.
Wisdom wearies, Love had wings –
Wealth makes burdens, Pleasure stings,
Glory proves a thorny crown –
So all gifts the gods throw down
Bring their pains and troubles after;
All save Momus, god of laughter.
He alone gives constant joy.
Hail to Momus, happy boy."
466,Emotion,LaughterPoemsSheHatesHerLaughterTheLittleRefugeegirlPoembydimitriosgalanis,"The ikon of that little face
always present asleep  or  awake.
The one hand stretched out to grasp,
the other beating, kicking waters back.
How could the poor weaked creatures
keep themselves on  the foam up!
Had she the strength to clasp him to her!
Slap on the mouth the wave,
saltiness swallowed for breath
gives her a turn.  Flinches,
in a whirlwind immersed...
Hh! she does not remember any more
what else  there and after happened at all.
Scene bitter in her memory etched,
turbulent sea,  to fight waters against,
the agony on  the gaze,
the suppliance in his crying voice.
They did not manage to save him too.
Drowned, they  said,
found him at the bottom, ...dead.
Oh! She still hears the bullets and bombs
falling rain in the neighborhood.
Her ear heard on the flight's  road
that many known and friends went lost,
these and these  she  as well  knew
schoolmates too and not a few.
Shudders the  mind, trembles the heart,
alone the  bitter tears often roll down.
She feels a knot clogging the  throat.
Sob strange comes often out as breath.
In  the foamed waves does not forget
that cursed moment,
does not,
and twists the poor button
once to the right once to the left.....
She hates her laughter,
she cuts it in the middle of the process,
she hides it, ashamed, afraid
obstinately closes  lips,
lest in  the world be heard,
a tear yes, preferred to be shared, yes!
He does not know, does not believe,
imagine can not,
whether her lips will ever again  laugh,
whether  reopen free  wings in the sky up.
How she can not bear  anyone
thinking of her a Lucky one,
when she would have  free  lips to laugh,
if only in her place  were that,
that child and all the other lost ones!

468,Emotion,LaughterPoemsLaughterAsMedicinePoembyHerbertNehrlich,"The light turned red
and there I sat
and watched a cuddle
inside a puddle.
A bird was dead
had cracked his head
against a truck,
what rotten luck!
His wife now tried
to be the guide
and make him fly
up in the sky.
She glanced at me
for company
but then she saw
the brain, so raw
and bright red blood
all mixed with mud.
Yet she remained,
her feathers stained
all drained of life -
a shattered wife.
Now came the law,
he looked and saw
that some dumb bird
sat undeterred
and full of grief,
'so', said the chief,
'you must disperse,
I cannot be for him the nurse.'
She would not budge
a final nudge
did not revive
her mate named Clive.
The copper took
his ticked book
and threw it high
to make her fly.
Now she was sad
but also mad
and could indeed
get up to speed.
She now attacked
the cop and whacked
with her strong beak
this cruel freak.
And then she rose
above his nose
and let it fly
into his eye.
Her spouse had just
as we all must
freed from his bod
the soul for God.
He now observed
how his unnerved
and angry mate
could vent her hate.
He laughed so hard,
God dropped his guard
the soul returned
and he had earned
a great reprieve,
no need to leave.
And if you aim to fight and win
Just laugh, it's super medicine."

Greeting of jokes and cordial words
Handshakes from outstretched hands
Kisses from pursed lips of pretty faces
Are the greeting from our friends
And melt any coolness of the heart
Loneliness of previous years
Fade like forgotten memories

Something that can never be replaced
No sorrow, no sadness to furrow the brow
Only smiles and laughter surround us now

Of love and life and laughter
You made your wish, you caught a star
It's happy ever after
The love that's yours is immense
It's only worthless things your losing
No more sitting on the fence
There's no better path for choosing
The light you have beside of you
It guides you from uncertainty
You'll no longer be asking who
You'll be sharing with eternity
When the darkness falls from up above
You'll be shining like a star so bright
Because you've found your own true love
You'll shine on through the night"

nothing that could be

the merest sliver.

a shadow of a shadow.
Throwing off its shadowy

472,Emotion,LaughterPoemsHollowLaughterPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"Yes, her laughter rang hollow

Ah, we hate the assertive

throwing glances so furtive
at her dress and her hat.
If we look past our noses
we may see a bit more;
even tulips and roses

For that joyful sound
I am forever after, seeking when you are around
Waiting for it to chortle, in the background
Hold not thy laughter
As it fights to escapes thy lips
To send me on joyful trips
Your giggles and cackles
Harmlessly tend to baffle
Your happy facial expressions
Paint only a gleeful picture of inspiration
As we rejoice to thy jubilant noises in full attention
Hold not thy laughter from the heart
Hold not thy laughter until we part
Hold not thy laughter as we make a start
When I dispel in my gloom
Thy laughter delivers me
Safely from my state of doom
Sadness runs outside from my room
Happiness inside glows with a boom
As my rosy cheeks mirthfully blossom
Hold not thy laughter as we cheerfully chat
Hold not thy laughter when you publicly fart
Hold not thy laughter whatever the format
A giggle, a chuckle, a titter not a snigger
Laugh it out whether thin or fat
Fill the air, my dear
Laugh it out before it scats out flat

475,Emotion,LaughterPoemsLaughterOfAnOldMagicianPoembyDavidKowalczyk,"The desert never leaves you.
This graveyard rich with dust and
tears is like the imaginary friends
you cherished as a child, who are
waiting, still, for you to join them.
Like the aching eyes of famished
children, like saints breathing fire,
there is a hard purity to the desert.
Patience sculpted the desert.
'Leave it all for the lazy future, ' whisper
the roadrunners and the tumbleweed.
The desert is full of

476,Emotion,LaughterPoemsTheGiftOfLaughterPoembyFrancisDuggan,"The gift of laughter is a rare gift it is such a wonderful thing
And laughter can create more laughter to it there is such a beautiful ring
The people who laugh seem to make friends quite easily and in numbers their friends seem to grow
But the people who take life too seriously are the people few wish to know.
The woman next door is a laugher she has with her a winning way
She is one who makes friends quite easily she always smiles and says good day
A person like her is worth knowing she spreads around her gift of cheer
For to stimulate laughter in her heart she doesn't need spirits or beer.
Compared to her the bloke three doors down is so different a smile never does cross his face
He is always so serious looking perhaps laughter he cannot embrace
A good laugh would be so good for him since none look more serious than he
If everyone took life so serious how boring a thing life would be.
The gift of laughter is a great gift and with it there's none to compare
And the people with it are invaluable since they spread it around everywhere
Life seems far too short to be grumpy since we will be forever dead
And feel grateful for people who can laugh their happiness they seem to spread."
477,Emotion,LaughterPoemsLaughterPoembyLindaWinchell,"If you need to heal what ales ya
go and laugh a hour or so.
Then all your aches and troubles will flee
you'll be much better off you know.
Take some time to make a funny face
that's all ya need to do.
Then someone might be watching
and they'll make one back at you!
Find a funny movie
go and share it with a friend
Then all your problems won't seem so large
and maybe they will even end?
See the brighter side of things
it's better then the dark.
Let one fly in a grocery store
go ahead let it rip, and give the world a fart!
Laugh you fool laugh and run
for the store managers after you.
See I made you laugh didn't I
that was all I was trying to do!"

Our minds become freed off tensions and stress;
If we make others laugh, they lose their fear,
And become dear, starting to us caress.
Laughter is good for both the young and old;
Laughter can turn a foe into a friend;
Laughter can help forget our woes, be bold;
Laughter can bring to grief, an early end.
Laughter is life’s most precious medicine;
Laughter is soothing balm for all our ills;
Laughter is euphoric much more than wine,
Causing no harm to one/ increasing bills.
Then laugh and be merry, whenever you can,
For, that’s the way to live life better, man."

481,Emotion,LaughterPoems20100805SweetLaughterPoembyMargaretAlice,"They looked up, Alligator and Crocodile,
and saw the most beautiful face smiling
at them, the lovely face of the rain queen
softly laughing, they heard the copper rings
clanging on the queen’s dancing feet, they
heard her sweet laughter within the weather’s
rumbling, she slowly advanced, spreading the
grey blanket of her life-giving veil, spun of clouds
thick and blue, building to purple and black, gone
was the sun, its fiery hue quenched by clouds
rolling on, and softly, mischievously, the rain
spread its mists as the rain queen danced
demurely at first, then wilder and wilder, more exciting,
enticing, Alligator and Crocodile joined in the dance, the
little folk of the plains, everyone, joined in the dance
hands clapping, feet drumming, voices lifted in song:
The rain is come, the rain is come, the rain queen is
here and listens to our song – The rain is come
Oh joy and love, joy and life, joy for evermore!

482,Emotion,LaughterPoemsCannedLaughterPoembyJoeGuillotin,"It makes me want to laugh
sawing a girl in half
and missing the mark
a bomb going off
in the middle of the park
a bird flying in an ocean of blue
hitting a pane of glass
invisible to view
It makes me want to laugh
telling them its showers
when its actually gas
when lullabies are sung for babies
who are perched precariously
on the limbs of trees
It makes me want to laugh
Those who believe in some great reward
when their next-door neighbor has a body stored
under freshly cemented foundation
But in all of creation...
It makes me want to laugh
when we blow up points on a map
on one man's behalf.
leaving thousands dead
It makes me want to laugh.
But I'll think I'll cry now instead."

485,Emotion,LaughterPoemsLaughterPoembyEdgarAlbertGuest,"Laughter sort o' settles breakfast better than digestive pills;
Found it, somehow in my travels, cure for every sort of ills;
When the hired help have riled me with their slipshod, careless ways,
An' I'm bilin' mad an' cussin' an' my temper's all ablaze,
If the calf gets me to laughin' while they're teachin' him to feed
Pretty soon I'm feelin' better, 'cause I've found the cure I need.
Like to start the day with laughter; when I've had a peaceful night,
An' can greet the sun all smilin', that day's goin' to be all right.
But there's nothing goes to suit me, when my system's full of bile;
Even horses quit their pullin' when the driver doesn't smile,
But they'll buckle to the traces when they hear a glad giddap,
Just as though they like to labor for a cheerful kind o' chap.
Laughter keeps me strong an' healthy. You can bet I'm all run down,
Fit for doctor folks an' nurses when I cannot shake my frown.
Found in farmin' laughter's useful, good for sheep an' cows an' goats;
When I've laughed my way through summer, reap the biggest crop of oats.
Laughter's good for any business, leastwise so it seems to me
Never knew a smilin' feller but was busy as could be.
Sometimes sit an' think about it, ponderin' on the ways of life,
Wonderin' why mortals gladly face the toil an care an' strife,
Then I come to this conclusion—take it now for what it's worth
It's the joy of laughter keeps us plodding on this stretch of earth.
Men the fun o' life are seeking—that's the reason for the calf
Spillin' mash upon his keeper—men are hungry for a laugh."
486,Emotion,LaughterPoemsFrozenLaughterForScarlettPoembyDónallDempsey,"We dashed outside
as the sky was falling.
“Crunch...crunch...crunch! ”
chanted the snow
as our footprints
chatted to it
in a bold yellow
booted voice
and slowly a bird
wrote itself across the sky
with such careful calligraphy
& our laughter
froze
right in front of our noses.
*******
OH SNOW!
(For Scarlett)
One day
the snow
popped its head
‘round the door
asked if it could stay
a week or maybe more.
Our smiles
said “Sure! ”
In & out
out & in
we lived
in its whiteness
until my feet
as if they weren’t part of me no more
demanded to come in
dreaming now of a roaring fire.
Flames! Flames!
I stuck my feet
in front of the fire
preferring chilblains to frostbite
but the snow
kept on calling for me.
“Come out...come out...jump about
in me! ”
I put my feet in my wellies
sent them out
to tramp about
in the fields of memory
but I kept
the rest of me
inside
hugging the fire
cuddling it
as it cuddled me.
A survivor
of my first ever remembered snow
that falls forever
over & over
as it remembers
me."
487,Emotion,LaughterPoemsLaughterAndTearsIxPoembyKhalilGibran,"As the Sun withdrew his rays from the garden, and the moon threw cushioned beams upon the flowers, I sat under the trees pondering upon the phenomena of the atmosphere, looking through the branches at the strewn stars which glittered like chips of silver upon a blue carpet; and I could hear from a distance the agitated murmur of the rivulet singing its way briskly into the valley.
When the birds took shelter among the boughs, and the flowers folded their petals, and tremendous silence descended, I heard a rustle of feet though the grass. I took heed and saw a young couple approaching my arbor. The say under a tree where I could see them without being seen.
After he looked about in every direction, I heard the young man saying, ""Sit by me, my beloved, and listen to my heart; smile, for your happiness is a symbol of our future; be merry, for the sparkling days rejoice with us.
""My soul is warning me of the doubt in your heart, for doubt in love is a sin. ""Soon you will be the owner of this vast land, lighted by this beautiful moon; soon you will be the mistress of my palace, and all the servants and maids will obey your commands.
""Smile, my beloved, like the gold smiles from my father's coffers.
""My heart refuses to deny you its secret. Twelve months of comfort and travel await us; for a year we will spend my father's gold at the blue lakes of Switzerland, and viewing the edifices of Italy and Egypt, and resting under the Holy Cedars of Lebanon; you will meet the princesses who will envy you for your jewels and clothes.
""All these things I will do for you; will you be satisfied?""
In a little while I saw them walking and stepping on flowers as the rich step upon the hearts of the poor. As they disappeared from my sight, I commenced to make comparison between love and money, and to analyze their position in the heart.
Money! The source of insincere love; the spring of false light and fortune; the well of poisoned water; the desperation of old age!
I was still wandering in the vast desert of contemplation when a forlorn and specter-like couple passed by me and sat on the grass; a young man and a young woman who had left their farming shacks in the nearby fields for this cool and solitary place.
After a few moments of complete silence, I heard the following words uttered with sighs from weather-bitten lips, ""Shed not tears, my beloved; love that opens our eyes and enslaves our hearts can give us the blessing of patience. Be consoled in our delay our delay, for we have taken an oath and entered Love's shrine; for our love will ever grow in adversity; for it is in Love's name that we are suffering the obstacles of poverty and the sharpness of misery and the emptiness of separation. I shall attack these hardships until I triumph and place in your hands a strength that will help over all things to complete the journey of life.
""Love - which is God - will consider our sighs and tears as incense burned at His altar and He will reward us with fortitude. Good-bye, my beloved; I must leave before the heartening moon vanishes.""
A pure voice, combined of the consuming flame of love, and the hopeless bitterness of longing and the resolved sweetness of patience, said, ""Good-bye, my beloved.""
They separated, and the elegy to their union was smothered by the wails of my crying heart.
I looked upon slumbering Nature, and with deep reflection discovered the reality of a vast and infinite thing -- something no power could demand, influence acquire, nor riches purchase. Nor could it be effaced by the tears of time or deadened by sorrow; a thing which cannot be discovered by the blue lakes of Switzerland or the beautiful edifices of Italy.
It is something that gathers strength with patience, grows despite obstacles, warms in winter, flourishes in spring, casts a breeze in summer, and bears fruit in autumn -- I found Love."
488,Emotion,LaughterPoemsFallingRainAndLaughterPoembyNatashaEdwards,"Rain falls from heaven and we catch it on our tongues
We laugh a proper laugh
Noses are cold
Hand stuffed in pockets to keep off the chill
We laugh a proper laugh
Walking and talking
We laugh a proper laugh
A boat passes and we stand still to watch
It passes us by
Like the years since your first cry
And we laugh a proper laugh
Sticks are thrown
Flowers are picked
And we laugh a proper laugh
We walk heads flung back mouths wide open
To catch
Rain that falls from heaven"

Whether you're young or old, laughter can be like
Magic to our souls, whenever we're feeling sad
Laughter can sustain us so that things don't seem
Quite so bad, if we give into laughter, it can be like
A cure for something that seems impossible to endure
So any time your spirits need a lift fill yourself
With laughter and you will find, a much happier
Person with a peaceful frame of mind"

THE SNAKES & LADDERS OF MY LIFE
I had 2 boy fishes
Bubble & Squeak
(but they croaked it) .
I cried when they died.
Now I’ve got 2 girl fishes
Kisses & Cuddles
(& they swim real neat) .
Sweet!
I lost my teeth
& Mum meets
her new boyfriend Trev.
Mum & Dad - split.
Dad got engaged.
My sister had her first kid
at 15.
I had my hair cut short
& was sad.
I think poetry...puberty’s
a bit of a change
because you grow tall
grow spots
grow more hairs
in private......places.
I got a lot older   &   I kissed my first girl.
Girls have changes in their chests
becoming outstanding.
Testicles get bigger.
Both sexes change emotions.
The way I feel ‘bout growing up is
...I’m scared!
I got shingles because I was depressed.
I got foot & mouth for humans.
I got something wrong with my legs.
I don’t want to grow up but
I will have to
...just deal with it!
I swam with dolphins.
This is the Snakes ‘n’ Ladders
of my life.

These are not my words...I just strung them together on a string to see where it would take them.  I was marking essays for the little ones who had just left the secure world of primary and were now floating around lost in secondary.  They were given the essay title LIFE CHANGES and these are the words and life stories of 32 little people and how they see the world and themselves. I didn't change anything just collected and collated and put them together to make this pattern.  This is their individual/collective poem. Their voices and view of the world is unmistakeably their own!"

You can even chuckle some long hours after
You laugh at what is sometimes seen
You laugh at things you do not mean
Yet some where in all hilarity
In amongst that crazy parody
Will Someone please tell me, I’ll give you money
What makes laughter, so darn funny!
Why, when you laugh do people laugh too?
Laugh not at things you say or things you do
Its crazy how when nothing’s funny
People laugh and clutch their to tummy
Will anybody tell me? Wouldn’t you? please, sonny
What makes laughter so gosh darn funny!
Yes, What makes laughter so gosh darn FUNNY!"
492,Emotion,LaughterPoemslaughterIsTimeTestedMedicinePoembyMamtaAgarwal,"People may not be laughing
All the way to the banks,
But going by SMS AND JOKES,
Still some have humour intact.
What if many have closed shop
And filed for bankruptcy,
As they are on the verge
Of going broke and hungry.
All streets-Wall or Dalal-
Bears are roaming freely
Its there day out-
Bulls have retreated meekly.
Who are Lehman Brothers?
What’s all the fuss about?
Are they fighting over property
Is it a family feud?
Your Standard has become Poor,
you are rightly feling Moody and blue,
and baffled left wondering
how come no one had a clue.
Pink slips and pay cuts
Are handed everyday.
All you can do is to
Keep calm and pray.
Well fellows, it’s time
To deeply  ponder and reflect,
And ensure now that
Every penny is well spent.
Simple living and high thinking
Is gaining on the popularity charts.
Staying afloat in tough times
Is no less than a survival art.
How about giving a miss to the Malls
And looking for a past time,
Other than drooling at dressed windows
For no reason or rhyme.
Every difficulty is an opportunity,
(THE WISE SAY)     in disguise.
Put away those swanky cars,
Don’t feel so demoralised.
Walk to work if you still have one
Shed all that extra weight.
And look like million bucks,
As a bonus you will have a clear head.
The roads will be
Free of traffic snarls and cars,
Pollution will come down
Bust goes the business of oxygen bars.
Everything happens for a reason,
Oft I have heard it mentioned.
Till people realise what is unnecessary consumption,
Long live the  bears and the recession."

There was a blue butterfly painted
And each morning we tried who should reach the
butterfly first.
Then the Grandmother said:  ""Do not eat the poor
butterfly.""
That made us laugh.
Always she said it and always it started us laughing.
It seemed such a sweet little joke.
I was certain that one fine morning
The butterfly would fly out of our plates,
Laughing the teeniest laugh in the world,
And perch on the Grandmother's lap."

A child's laughter can bring a smile
To one who hasn't done so in such a long while
I know because that one was me
Until my daughter's laugh set mine free
A child's laughter so gleeful and pure
An innocence adults miss for sure
Laughter that can bring back the past
And memories of a youth that flew by so fast
A child's laughter can bring out the best
Of most any man when he's depressed
Cause his spirit that's fallen to soar
Until at last he laughs once more"

501,Emotion,PassionPoemsTrilogyOfPassion01ToWertherPoembyJohannWolfgangvonGoethe,"ONCE more, then, much-wept shadow, thou dost dare
Boldly to face the day's clear light,
To meet me on fresh blooming meadows fair,
And dost not tremble at my sight.
Those happy times appear return'd once more.
When on one field we quaff'd refreshing dew,
And, when the day's unwelcome toils were o'er,
The farewell sunbeams bless'd our ravish'd view;
Fate bade thee go,--to linger here was mine,--
Going the first, the smaller loss was thine.
The life of man appears a glorious fate:
The day how lovely, and the night how great!
And we 'mid Paradise-like raptures plac'd,
The sun's bright glory scarce have learn'd to taste.
When strange contending feelings dimly cover,
Now us, and now the forms that round us hover;
One's feelings by no other are supplied,
'Tis dark without, if all is bright inside;
An outward brightness veils my sadden'd mood,
When Fortune smiles,--how seldom understood!
Now think we that we know her, and with might
A woman's beauteous form instils delight;
The youth, as glad as in his infancy,
The spring-time treads, as though the spring were he
Ravish'd, amazed, he asks, how this is done?
He looks around, the world appears his own.
With careless speed he wanders on through space,
Nor walls, nor palaces can check his race;
As some gay flight of birds round tree-tops plays,
So 'tis with him who round his mistress strays;
He seeks from AEther, which he'd leave behind him,
The faithful look that fondly serves to bind him.
Yet first too early warn'd, and then too late,
He feels his flight restrain'd, is captur'd straight
To meet again is sweet, to part is sad,
Again to meet again is still more glad,
And years in one short moment are enshrin'd;
But, oh, the harsh farewell is hid behind!
Thou smilest, friend, with fitting thoughts inspired;
By a dread parting was thy fame acquired,
Thy mournful destiny we sorrow'd o'er,
For weal and woe thou left'st us evermore,
And then again the passions' wavering force
Drew us along in labyrinthine course;
And we, consumed by constant misery,
At length must part--and parting is to die!
How moving is it, when the minstrel sings,
To 'scape the death that separation brings!
Oh grant, some god, to one who suffers so,
To tell, half-guilty, his sad tale of woe."

503,Emotion,PassionPoemsAnnualCommemorationOfTheDivinePassionPoembyWilliamCook,"You eclipse me & I have stained the Sun with black love...
death from a bottle cools my ardour
for a while, until I see you again.
The damp distance is bleached
then blackened with shadows
& flocks of shrill birds, screaming for blood
Bound hands grow swollen
body – silently numbed
a bed on fire I laid upon
now reddened with burning life
In these blistered hours of insomnia
objects are like lead
I believe they are other things & less than they are
as if fewer of them would create
a stillness like sleep
— if only to dream of her again
The cushions beckon in the mirror
white & summoning, judicious
the bed reflected in that fantasy land,
that round pool of hope
Why stir dust on a sacred tomb
as I lay down with a prayer for darkness
a snowflake melts on her virgin eyelids
somewhere & now, together again
we drink every breath of poisoned air
she asleep, I awake...
Not believing in resurrection —
I stroll through cemeteries
looking for her name, not wanting to see it
the damp brown earth reminds me
every hour we breathe is our last;
victims don’t want blind skies
their toil & consistency as mortals
are truer religions than faith itself,
so welcome me as one of them — into your house.
The last star’s neon spark
will be dissolved painlessly.
Morning will knock on the window, still —
like a grey wet wind
slow day will begin to stir.
Livestock shiver in the cold dawn,
some kind of slaughterhouse morn
the blood drained dreams
dissipate, replaced by
perpetual sameness...
Awakened from a long dark dream,
I thought I saw her somewhere in there
the awesome force of sleep’s return
shut me down like wild song
like black amphibious wine
a hollow ghost —
peering senselessly through the cold
window of every lost night
This morning once again
on motionless ground,
& along with it
drinking cold mountain air outside;
refined air, once, our air...
Across the crisp cool valley — white snow
blue mountains of decrepit glass & dream
dissolve, in this fresh green brocade
Hope sparkles in the diamond dew
that mirrors the sun
for a minute
while across the way, beyond this place
despair draws its dark curtain of cloud
over the broken road;
another day annexed,
closer to you again, I come."
504,Emotion,PassionPoemsAMomentOfPassionPoembyKevElmer,"A moment of passion so easily shared,
with no fear or regret.
The memories flood through my mind,
a moment of passion I'll never forget.
A moment of passion is like a drug,
it takes me so high.
Needing to get another fix,
a moment of passion can never lie
A moment of passion when we are alone,
you desire it too.
Unable to control it,
a moment of passion shared with you."
505,Emotion,PassionPoemsPassionTakesFlightPoembyRayLucero,"Walk any crowded city street
See vacant stares on a sea of faces
How stiff they walk on frozen feet
Of long forgotten social graces
Is passion within human hearts gone
As far as knowing eyes can see?
Love and joy no longer paragon
'Lord', why won’t they look at me?
Your passion Vincent helps them find wings
As paint on canvas did so long ago
Lovely are the words your paintings sing
As if by magic, vivid flowers seem to grow
Soon, God’s Hands shall touch hearts again
Of long forgotten buried and the walking dead
Made afresh what was once arcane
The Will of God shall once more embed
Countless souls shall launch an upward flight
None shall rest, until they reach Eternal Light

Quickly decide, we must not waste a minute of time
Deftly remove all my clothes
Slowly I begin to caress your soft skin
My fingertips start to wander
Feeling the softness of you
Those tender breasts draw my fingers to them
Touching and stroking them
Covering your body with kisses
Over the curve of the breasts
Slowly reaching the nipples peak
Sucking with greedy abandon
The heat of our bodies rapidly rising
Breathing starts to increase
Panting harder wanting you now
Your body inviting
Moulding itself into mine
Thighs parted anticipating
Requesting my body’s presence
Obligingly I settle between them
Connecting to you
So slowly at first bodies moving in time
Reaching deeper into the depths of passion
Increasing the rate of heated attack
Faster rapier like movements
Lust consuming us both
Animalistic instincts taking over
Both wanting our own pleasure
Minds blocked to all other thoughts
Oh the passion
Faster we ride our primeval lust
Peaking explosively together
Tasted the essence of passion
Screaming my name in orgasm
Your body bucks with mine
We are as one, engulfed in each other"

The vinegar-heavy sponge, the flowers by Kedron stream;
We will bend down and loosen our hair over you,
That it may drop faint perfume, and be heavy with dew,
Lilies of death-pale hope, roses of passionate dream."

yet it rocks her up by shadows as dark
for all the raved up alphabets as when learned
whispering the love as when rambled
by the passion through latticed window
the light when goes away flicking bye
shadows as melting saddened by the glooms
into the room of its repose as wrinkled
yet in silence poised by the pretensions"

But how shall I, unless you yourselves be also the peacemakers, nay, the lovers of all your elements?
Your reason and your passion are the rudder and the sails of your seafaring soul.
If either your sails or our rudder be broken, you can but toss and drift, or else be held at a standstill in mid-seas.
For reason, ruling alone, is a force confining; and passion, unattended, is a flame that burns to its own destruction.
Therefore let your soul exalt your reason to the height of passion; that it may sing;
And let it direct your passion with reason, that your passion may live through its own daily resurrection, and like the phoenix rise above its own ashes.
I would have you consider your judgment and your appetite even as you would two loved guests in your house.
Surely you would not honour one guest above the other; for he who is more mindful of one loses the love and the faith of both.
Among the hills, when you sit in the cool shade of the white poplars, sharing the peace and serenity of distant fields and meadows - then let your heart say in silence, ""God rests in reason.""
And when the storm comes, and the mighty wind shakes the forest, and thunder and lightning proclaim the majesty of the sky, - then let your heart say in awe, ""God moves in passion.""
And since you are a breath In God's sphere, and a leaf in God's forest, you too should rest in reason and move in passion."
513,Emotion,PassionPoemsPassionOfLifePoembyPOOJANATARAJAN,"To achieve something great in the world you need Passion
To fulfill vision, a great leader’s courage comes from Passion
Whatever it may be, you must find your Passion
If passion drives you, let reason hold the reins
Follow your passion and success will follow you!
Never underestimate the power of passion
Without passion religion is spiritless
Without Passion history is meaningless
Without Passion art is useless
Follow your passion and success will follow you!
When you take up a mission with passion
There are no dreams too large
No innovation unimaginable
No frontiers beyond reach
Follow your passion and success will follow you!
Our passions are the winds that propel our vessel
Our reason is the pilot that steers her
Without winds the vessel would not move
Without a pilot she would be lost
Follow your passion and success will follow you!
There is no end and there is no beginning
There is only the passion of life
Passion is universal humanity
Passion is the genesis of genius
Follow your passion and success will follow you!

514,Emotion,PassionPoemsTrilogyOfPassion02ElegyPoembyJohannWolfgangvonGoethe,"When man had ceased to utter his lament,
A god then let me tell my tale of sorrow.
WHAT hope of once more meeting is there now
In the still-closed blossoms of this day?
Both heaven and hell thrown open seest thou;
What wav'ring thoughts within the bosom play
No longer doubt! Descending from the sky,
She lifts thee in her arms to realms on high.
And thus thou into Paradise wert brought,
As worthy of a pure and endless life;
Nothing was left, no wish, no hope, no thought,
Here was the boundary of thine inmost strife:
And seeing one so fair, so glorified,
The fount of yearning tears was straightway dried.
No motion stirr'd the day's revolving wheel,
In their own front the minutes seem'd to go;
The evening kiss, a true and binding seal,
Ne'er changing till the morrow's sunlight glow.
The hours resembled sisters as they went.
Yet each one from another different.
The last hour's kiss, so sadly sweet, effac'd
A beauteous network of entwining love.
Now on the threshold pause the feet, now haste.
As though a flaming cherub bade them move;
The unwilling eye the dark road wanders o'er,
Backward it looks, but closed it sees the door.
And now within itself is closed this breast,
As though it ne'er were open, and as though,
Vying with ev'ry star, no moments blest
Had, in its presence, felt a kindling glow;
Sadness, reproach, repentance, weight of care,
Hang heavy on it in the sultry air.
Is not the world still left? The rocky steeps,
Are they with holy shades no longer crown'd?
Grows not the harvest ripe? No longer creeps
The espalier by the stream,--the copse around?
Doth not the wondrous arch of heaven still rise,
Now rich in shape, now shapeless to the eyes?
As, seraph-like, from out the dark clouds' chorus,
With softness woven, graceful, light, and fair,
Resembling Her, in the blue aether o'er us,
A slender figure hovers in the air,--
Thus didst thou see her joyously advance,
The fairest of the fairest in the dance.
Yet but a moment dost thou boldly dare
To clasp an airy form instead of hers;
Back to thine heart! thou'lt find it better there,
For there in changeful guise her image stirs
What erst was one, to many turneth fast,
In thousand forms, each dearer than the last.
As at the door, on meeting lingerd she,
And step by step my faithful ardour bless'd,
For the last kiss herself entreated me,
And on my lips the last last kiss impress'd,--
Thus clearly traced, the lov'd one's form we view,
With flames engraven on a heart so true,--
A heart that, firm as some embattled tower,
Itself for her, her in itself reveres,
For her rejoices in its lasting power,
Conscious alone, when she herself appears;
Feels itself freer in so sweet a thrall,
And only beats to give her thanks in all.
The power of loving, and all yearning sighs
For love responsive were effaced and drown'd;
While longing hope for joyous enterprise
Was form'd, and rapid action straightway found;
If love can e'er a loving one inspire,
Most lovingly it gave me now its fire;
And 'twas through her!--an inward sorrow lay
On soul and body, heavily oppress'd;
To mournful phantoms was my sight a prey,
In the drear void of a sad tortured breast;
Now on the well-known threshold Hope hath smil'd,
Herself appeareth in the sunlight mild.
Unto the peace of God, which, as we read,
Blesseth us more than reason e'er bath done,
Love's happy peace would I compare indeed,
When in the presence of the dearest one.
There rests the heart, and there that sweetest thought,
The thought of being hers, is check'd by nought.
In the pure bosom doth a yearning float,
Unto a holier, purer, unknown Being
Its grateful aspiration to devote,
The Ever-Nameless then unriddled seeing;
We call it: piety!--such blest delight
I feel a share in, when before her sight.
Before her sight, as 'neath the sun's hot ray,
Before her breath, as 'neath the spring's soft wind,
In its deep wintry cavern melts away
Self-love, so long in icy chains confin'd;
No selfishness and no self-will are nigh,
For at her advent they were forced to fly.
It seems as though she said: ""As hours pass by
They spread before us life with kindly plan;
Small knowledge did the yesterday supply,
To know the morrow is conceal'd from man;
And if the thought of evening made me start,
The sun at setting gladden'd straight my heart.
""Act, then, as I, and look, with joyous mind,
The moment in the face; nor linger thou!
Meet it with speed, so fraught with life, so kind
In action, and in love so radiant now;
Let all things be where thou art, childlike ever,
Thus thoult be all, thus, thou'lt be vanquish'd never.""
Thou speakest well, methought, for as thy guide
The moment's favour did a god assign,
And each one feels himself when by thy side,
Fate's fav'rite in a moment so divine;
I tremble at thy look that bids me go,
Why should I care such wisdom vast to know?
Now am I far! And what would best befit
The present minute? I could scarcely tell;
Full many a rich possession offers it,
These but offend, and I would fain repel.
Yearnings unquenchable still drive me on,
All counsel, save unbounded tears, is gone.
Flow on, flow on in never-ceasing course,
Yet may ye never quench my inward fire!
Within my bosom heaves a mighty force,
Where death and life contend in combat dire.
Medicines may serve the body's pangs to still;
Nought but the spirit fails in strength of will,--
Fails in conception; wherefore fails it so?
A thousand times her image it portrays;
Enchanting now, and now compell'd to go,
Now indistinct, now clothed in purest rays!
How could the smallest comfort here be flowing?
The ebb and flood, the coming and the going!
Leave me here now, my life's companions true!
Leave me alone on rock, in moor and heath;
But courage! open lies the world to you,
The glorious heavens above, the earth beneath;
Observe, investigate, with searching eyes,
And nature will disclose her mysteries.
To me is all, I to myself am lost,
Who the immortals' fav'rite erst was thought;
They, tempting, sent Pandoras to my cost,
So rich in wealth, with danger far more fraught;
They urged me to those lips, with rapture crown'd,
Deserted me, and hurl'd me to the ground."

Looking to see what

Soft kiss touches on

516,Emotion,PassionPoemsUnreservedPassionPoembyUriahHamilton,"She seductively sat
Upon my lap like a child,
Like a kindergartner
With proud innocent curls
On a sexy, naïve evening.
She placed her fingers on my lips,
She then pressed
Her whole hand
Against my chest,
She traveled south
And gave the slightest
Intoxicating touch
To my sensitive region.
We embraced
By soft October bridges
In the dark, romantic wine-glass night,
She told me not to speak,
Just to think wordless prayers.
And kiss her with unreserved passion."

Putting on that neatly pressed white cotton long sleeves
feeling I just want to fix it, wear your silk tie on it,
put on your pants as I will pull it up your knees
as I reach it closer, smelling your afterbathe scent...
Nice suit matches your features best
Wow...you made me feel amazed...
and as you walk pass my sight
I can't help to put on my gown, cling on your arm so tight!
Yet my imagination wander wild
feeling to take that suit off again and touch
your torso that I long to trace so much
passion been ignited as I see you naughtily wink and smiled...!"
518,Emotion,PassionPoemsLaPassionVaincuePoembyAnneKingsmillFinch,"On the Banks of the Severn a desperate Maid
(Whom some Shepherd, neglecting his Vows, had betray'd,)
Stood resolving to banish all Sense of the Pain,
And pursue, thro' her Death, a Revenge on the Swain.
Since the Gods, and my Passion, at once he defies;
Since his Vanity lives, whilst my Character dies;
No more (did she say) will I trifle with Fate,
But commit to the Waves both my Love and my Hate.
And now to comply with that furious Desire,
Just ready to plunge, and alone to expire,
Some Reflection on Death, and its Terrors untry'd,
Some Scorn for the Shepherd, some Flashings of Pride
At length pull'd her back, and she cry'd, Why this Strife,
Since the Swains are so Many, and I've but One Life?"
519,Emotion,PassionPoemsTheSadShepherdsPassionOfLovePoembyGeorgePeele,"O Gentle Love, ungentle for thy deed,
Thou makest my heart
A bloody mark
With piercing shot to bleed.
Shoot soft, sweet Love, for fear thou shoot amiss,
For fear too keen
Thy arrows been,
And hist the heart where my beloved is.
Too fair that fortune were, nor never I
Shall be so blest,
Among the rest,
That Love shall seize on her by sympathy.
Then since with Love my prayers bear no boot,
This doth remain
To cease my pain,
I take the wound, and die at Venus' foot."

Let's grimly kiss with bated breath;
As quietly and solemnly
As Life when it is kissing Death.
Now in the silence of the grave,
My hand is squeezing that soft breast;
While thou dost in such passion lie,
It mocks me with its look of rest.
But when the morning comes at last,
And we must part, our passions cold,
You'll think of some new feather, scarf
To buy with my small piece of gold;
And I'll be dreaming of green lanes,
Where little things with beating hearts
Hold shining eyes between the leaves,
Till men with horses pass, and carts."

Wandering with a passion of a possessed soul
Swimming in the azure waters of my wonderous cove
Thought that I had discovered love that was whole
In your light, the rays that touched me set me ablaze
Torching a flame in my heart, urging a song
To give, to surrender, to live forever in this love haze
And to live in this radiant light for as long
as the fire crackled in this warm universe
and the monsoon made love to this thirsty earth
Drenched in this ecstasy, I let the beauty dance
Unleashing a rapturous force that shook my soul
Breathing new life in me with just one of your glance
Words pouring out to celebrate this romance
In this dawn of hope, he came with a searing kiss
And woke me up from this languid dream
where I had got lost in the timeless bliss
Now completely awake, dazzled by the sunbeams
Groping in the darkness of my subconscious
All I remembered, t'was a dream...so sensuous"
527,Emotion,PassionPoemsWithoutPassionPoembyOrevaOku,"I think and thought
i hoped and wished
i cried and mourned
i yelled and laughed
i screamed in excitement
then i realised it was passion.
Passion is strong
it is intense
it is a great feelin of emotion
love, hate, desire, enthusiasm, fondness, zeal, affection and ardor.
A man without passion is like a man without life.
Yes, i pride in myself, i have life because
i have passion,
i know love
i show affection
i know what it is to be fond of
i can give warmth
i am full of ardor.
Just when i was begining to be exalted by my feelings you came into my life,
i found you in my soul
then i knew what i claimed was passion, was nothing compared to what you gave me.
I came to realise that passion wasn't anything else but a woman.And not just any woman, it was you.
Then i remembered 'a man without passion is a man without life.Without you i'm incomplete, without passion i have no life
Now i can boast of passion of love of life.
Because i have you."

You have to enter untying your robes
Layer by layer revealing the core
Naked in all your majestic beauty
Our spirits entwining, together we soar
Oceans part, thousands new moons appear
With the energy of our combined kundalinis
Infinite flutes start playing music to the ears
Intoxicated, the beings start spinning
The sun will be eclipsed
With the sheer fire set ablaze
The dark sky will be illumined
The stars will twirl in a daze
Then my love, we will cease to be
Moving away towards infinity
Finally the doors will open for us
Our light shall always fluoresce"

Her heart in true love…….
Can there be a paradise sweeter?

Warrior home at last?
Today is captive
In the ocean of this whirlwind world
Tomorrow spreads its wings
Bringing hope in its tail end
The sweep of joy
Keeps you alive

To cherish! !
Hope is the rope
That spurns the heart to action

Perhaps stilled you to the present!

With each day’s passing!

as your feelings overflow
Let me draw you to the place
where ecstasy can be embraced

And I will dare to tell,
But in the lover's ear alone,
What once to me befell.
When she I loved looked every day
Fresh as a rose in June,
I to her cottage bent my way,
Beneath an evening-moon.
Upon the moon I fixed my eye,
All over the wide lea;
With quickening pace my horse drew nigh
Those paths so dear to me.
And now we reached the orchard-plot;
And, as we climbed the hill,
The sinking moon to Lucy's cot
Came near, and nearer still.
In one of those sweet dreams I slept,
Kind Nature's gentlest boon!
And all the while my eye I kept
On the descending moon.
My horse moved on; hoof after hoof
He raised, and never stopped:
When down behind the cottage roof,
At once, the bright moon dropped.
What fond and wayward thoughts will slide
Into a Lover's head!
'O mercy!' to myself I cried,
'If Lucy hould be dead!'"

Precursor to the rebirth
Of more scenic terrains of passion
We explore the umbilical union
Two souls embedded with escapism
Could we breathe the confined air?
Necessities surge but a test
You and I progressed
Love is paramount
As alive as Death Valley
I guess the rains down in here
Tormented and isolated…
The soils are red as our rigid hearts
The night skies were the curtain of Paradise…
Could we excel on no man’s land?
Far from over,
Pyramid and the Sphinx…
Proudest of the dessert
Great Wall of China…
A sign of loyalty
Taj Mahal love prowess
Leila and Majnun…
Love tragic
Dear…you’re manic!
What’s the significance of those?
Ain’t get enough of the trust?
Make no mistake
James Blunt singing ‘same mistake’
The song flows right to my heart
I treated your internal wounds
Like Oasis says ‘stop crying your heart out’
I lick your heartache spills
Like Bonnie Tyler says ‘it’s a heartache’
I will hammer Greenland’s iceberg
Nourishing your thirst for me
I will swim rough waters of Cape of Good Hope
Rescuing you from drowning
I will brave Siberian’s winter
Making an Igloo for us
I will befriend the lost tribes of Amazon
Telling them of our wedding day
The lighthouse of Newfoundland
Would welcome us as we ashore
Greetings from fauna and flora
Enchanting like morning dews dripping
Welcoming two soul mates
Dear…we’re manic
Love as deep as Black Hole
We float on the planetarium
Jupiter would smile and says ‘hello’
The moon says ‘bye bye I’d miss ya good fellow'
Milky ways shimmer as we journey through
Final escalation is yet to come
Beyond the spectrum
Heaven waits…"

Lest my dream come to an end"
548,Emotion,PassionPoemsLoveOfFameTheUniversalPassionExcerptPoembyEdwardYoung,"Man's rich with little, were his judgment true;
Nature is frugal, and her wants are few;
Those few wants answer'd, bring sincere delights;
But fools create themselves new appetites:
Fancy and pride seek things at vast expense,
Which relish not to reason, nor to sense.
When surfeit, or unthankfulness, destroys,
In nature's narrow sphere, our solid joys,
In fancy's airy land of noise and show,
Where nought but dreams, no real pleasures grow;
Like cats in air-pumps, to subsist we strive
On joys too thin to keep the soul alive.
Lemira's sick; make haste; the doctor call:
He comes; but where's his patient? At the ball.
The doctor stares; her woman curt'sies low,
And cries, ""My lady, sir, is always so:
Diversions put her maladies to flight;
True, she can't stand, but she can dance all night:
I've known my lady (for she loves a tune)
For fevers take an opera in June:
And, though perhaps you'll think the practice bold,
A midnight park is sovereign for a cold:
With colics, breakfasts of green fruit agree;
With indigestions, supper just at three.""
A strange alternative, replied Sir Hans,
Must women have a doctor, or a dance?
Though sick to death, abroad they safely roam,
But droop and die, in perfect health, at home:
For want--but not of health, are ladies ill;
And tickets cure beyond the doctor's bill."

As real as a lovers fight
As real as teh laughter
Of a child in delight....
As real as the expanse of the sea
As real what lurks underneath

Gaze into the depth of my soul
Make it sublime and surreal...."
550,Emotion,PassionPoemsBardsOfPassionAndOfMirthPoembyJohnKeats,"BARDS of Passion and of Mirth,
Ye have left your souls on earth!
Have ye souls in heaven too,
Doubled-lived in regions new?
Yes, and those of heaven commune
With the spheres of sun and moon;
With the noise of fountains wondrous,
And the parle of voices thund'rous;
With the whisper of heaven's trees
And one another, in soft ease
Seated on Elysian lawns
Browsed by none but Dian's fawns;
Underneath large blue-bells tented,
Where the daisies are rose-scented,
And the rose herself has got
Perfume which on earth is not;
Where the nightingale doth sing
Not a senseless, tranced thing,
But divine melodious truth;
Philosophic numbers smooth;
Tales and golden histories
Of heaven and its mysteries.
Thus ye live on high, and then
On the earth ye live again;
And the souls ye left behind you
Teach us, here, the way to find you,
Where your other souls are joying,
Never slumber'd, never cloying.
Here, your earth-born souls still speak
To mortals, of their little week;
Of their sorrows and delights;
Of their passions and their spites;
Of their glory and their shame;
What doth strengthen and what maim.
Thus ye teach us, every day,
Wisdom, though fled far away.
Bards of Passion and of Mirth,
Ye have left your souls on earth!
Ye have souls in heaven too,
Double-lived in regions new!"
551,Emotion,PassionPoemsPassionPoembyKristenWoods,"It lies in all of us,
Sleeping,
Waiting
And though unwanted,
Unbidden
It will stir
Open its jaws and howl
It speaks to us, guides us
PASSION rules us all,
And we obey,
What other choice do we have?
PASSION is the source of our finest moments
The Joy of LOVE,
The Clarity of HATRED,
And the Ecstasy of GRIEF
It hurts sometimes,
More than we can bear
If we could live without PASSION maybe we'd know some kind of peace
But we would be hollow,
Empty rooms,
Meaningless lives,
Withiut PASSION we'd be truly,"
552,Emotion,PassionPoemsThePassionPoembyJohnMilton,"I
Erewhile of music, and ethereal mirth,
Wherewith the stage of Air and Earth did ring,
And joyous news of heavenly Infant’s birth,
My muse with Angels did divide to sing;
But headlong joy is ever on the wing,
In wintry solstice like the shortened light
Soon swallowed up in dark and long outliving night.
II
For now to sorrow must I tune my song,
And set my Harp to notes of saddest woe,
Which on our dearest Lord did seize ere long,
Dangers, and snares, and wrongs, and worse than so,
Which he for us did freely undergo:
Most perfect Hero, tried in heaviest plight
Of labours huge and hard, too hard for human wight!
III
He, sovran Priest, stooping his regal head,
That dropt with odorous oil down his fair eyes,
Poor fleshly Tabernacle enterèd,
His starry front low-roofed beneath the skies:
Oh, what a mask was there, what a disguise!
Yet more: the stroke of death he must abide;
Then lies him meekly down fast by his Brethren’s side.
IV
These latest scenes confine my roving verse;
To this horizon is my Phœbus bound.
His godlike acts, and his temptations fierce,
And former sufferings, otherwhere are found;
Loud o’er the rest Cremona’s trump doth sound:
Me softer airs befit, and softer strings
Of lute, or viol still, more apt for mournful things.
V
Befriend me, Night, best Patroness of grief!
Over the pole thy thickest mantle throw,
And work my flattered fancy to belief
That Heaven and Earth are coloured with my woe;
My sorrows are too dark for day to know:
The leaves should all be black whereon I write,
And letters, where my tears have washed, a wannish white.
VI
See, see the chariot, and those rushing wheels,
That whirled the prophet up at Chebar flood;
My spirit some transporting Cherub feels
To bear me where the Towers of Salem stood,
Once glorious towers, now sunk in guiltless blood.
There doth my soul in holy vision sit,
In pensive trance, and anguish, and ecstatic fit.
VII
Mine eye hath found that sad sepulchral rock
That was the casket of Heaven’s richest store,
And here, though grief my feeble hands up-lock,
Yet on the softened quarry would I score
My plaining verse as lively as before;
For sure so well instructed are my tears
That they would fitly fall in ordered characters.
VIII
Or, should I thence, hurried on viewless wing,
Take up a weeping on the mountains wild,
The gentle neighbourhood of grove and spring
Would soon unbosom all their Echoes mild;
And I (for grief is easily beguiled)
Might think the infection of my sorrows loud
Had got a race of mourners on some pregnant cloud.
This Subject the Author finding to be above the years he had when he wrote it, and nothing satisfied with what was begun, left it unfinished."

Gently brushing against your skin
I wish I was a ray of sunlight
Giving you warmth that would stay through the night
I wish I was a dropp of wine
That mingled in your blood making it my shrine

In the garden of love where you were a prince
I wish I was the spring
In your life with blossoms spreading their wings
I wish I was your breath
Enervating you, keeping you alive"

I have held her heart to heart;
And have felt her heart-strings stirred,
And her soul’s still singing heard
For one golden-haloed hour
Of Love’s life the passion-flower.

I have tasted of its best;
And shall laugh while I have breath
At thy dart and thee, O Death!"

fused in the heat of passion

559,Emotion,PassionPoemsPassionPoembyCharlotteBrontë,"SOME have won a wild delight,
By daring wilder sorrow;
Could I gain thy love to-night,
I'd hazard death to-morrow.
Could the battle-struggle earn
One kind glance from thine eye,
How this withering heart would burn,
The heady fight to try !
Welcome nights of broken sleep,
And days of carnage cold,
Could I deem that thou wouldst weep
To hear my perils told.
Tell me, if with wandering bands
I roam full far away,
Wilt thou, to those distant lands,
In spirit ever stray ?
Wild, long, a trumpet sounds afar;
Bid me­bid me go
Where Seik and Briton meet in war,
On Indian Sutlej's flow.
Blood has dyed the Sutlej's waves
With scarlet stain, I know;
Indus' borders yawn with graves,
Yet, command me go !
Though rank and high the holocaust
Of nations, steams to heaven,
Glad I'd join the death-doomed host,
Were but the mandate given.
Passion's strength should nerve my arm,
Its ardour stir my life,
Till human force to that dread charm
Should yield and sink in wild alarm,
Like trees to tempest-strife.
If, hot from war, I seek thy love,
Darest thou turn aside ?
Darest thou, then, my fire reprove,
By scorn, and maddening pride ?
No­my will shall yet control
Thy will, so high and free,
And love shall tame that haughty soul­
Yes­tenderest love for me.
I'll read my triumph in thine eyes,
Behold, and prove the change;
Then leave, perchance, my noble prize,
Once more in arms to range.
I'd die when all the foam is up,
The bright wine sparkling high;
Nor wait till in the exhausted cup
Life's dull dregs only lie.
Then Love thus crowned with sweet reward,
Hope blest with fulness large,
I'd mount the saddle, draw the sword,
And perish in the charge !"
560,Emotion,PassionPoemsHerPassionPoembylouisrams,"i see the passion in your eyes
i feel the warmth of your embrace
i see every curve and crevice
in the beauty of your face.
i've seen the passion in you rise
to a boiling point of no return
and the touch of you
to my skin burn.
in you is the beauty of the stars
and the depth of the universe
and at the same time
the emptiness of space
to capture you, a long frenzy race.
for your beauty is far beyond compare
and is something that i'm willing to share
Except for the love that i know is locked up inside.
for when this love is finally set free
you will hear all church bells ring.
this love will touch every mans soul
and the core of all their hearts
and pull up feelings which they
did not know could exist.
and turn their lives into 'heavenly bliss'.

and if not reached, a downright sin,"

I just want to let you do whatever you want
I feel helpless when I am around you
Your kisses are like poison
They knock me senseless
for hours at a time
And your sweet caress
is more than I can bear
It all makes me feel helpless when I am around you
I shouldn't be wanting you like I do
I can't help it that you have me under your spell
No matter how hard I try to fight it
I still feel myself falling for you
Every time that I look at you
I can feel the toxins of your passion burning through me
Now your passion is burning in me too
Your passion is like a wild fire
It burns deep within your heart and soul
I can feel it when you look at me
I can feel it when we kiss
Oh how I love to see your passion burning so brightly"
562,Emotion,PassionPoemsWhatIsPassionPoembyDeeDaffodil,"What is passion?
Please explain..
Lest my heart be torn apart
What is passion?
Is it the giving or receiving?
The feeling or believing?
The newness or the trueness?
The ups the downs...
The aches...the pains...
Is it a whirlwind?
A merry-go-round?
A turbulent storm...
That comes before the calm?
Is it lasting?
Does it wane?
If it's lost...
Will it ever find it's home again?
What is passion?

Seeking a vision that got lost
Fire consumed or a lost monsoon
Parched earth awaiting a boon
A solitary traveller in an undulating desert
that got lost....
Come show me the way
In your light, everything is clear
And its a sunny day
In your absence, its all dark and queer
All thoughts gone astray
Come show me the way
In your sound, everything is music to the ears
To which I dance and sway
In your absence, cacophony blares
All notes dark and gray
Come show me the way
In your touch, everything is pure
With a bright spark and a ray
In your absence, cannot endure
Even my own skin, t'is like clay"

565,Emotion,PassionPoemsWhatOfPassionPoembyFaySlimm,"Passion and judgement often wage war, bold
Reason tho', speaks to make peace, and awards
Both rudder and sail to unseasoned souls,
Who, broken by passion unchained, broaden
Pain to deep grief, as in sailing ahead
With unfettered ardour, birth more stormy,
Ill-disposed fantasy, which covets dreaded
Control. Instead, haul in fervour, to form
Anchored alliance with reason. Harbour there,
Where, touched by compassion, hearts without ire
Can flourish passionately, yet fairly act.
Willing to serve, eagerness meets desire,
Catches fire, and true rapture emerges.
Shakes free illicit lusts, then is purged,
And becomes purely ecstatic gold-dust.
Such ageless rapture will never grow old."
566,Emotion,PassionPoemsAPassionPoembyMariaBarbaraKorynt,"She is falling softly on the floor with thin muslin
Taken down nervously from shoulders.
As will o' the wisps on swamps
Hands turning white with glow of the moon
Hastily to wilderness bodies are wandering
In order to get lost in delight.
She is tilting the head with gilding of the weight
Of soft waving hair with storm-tossed sea.
She is searching for the stronger backrest, stopping
The pressure of the hurricane of desire what kind of Thrusting
the ship onto an iceberg, wants with frenzy
To heat it up and to melt.
She is finding the road for oneself only known
At the longed-for target.
He, patient in his rush knows
That altogether climbed peaks they will record the image
Of unrivalled champion
Of elaborate caresses and delights of imagination
In her eyes."

And am I the summer?
Thawing you from your stony guise
The water now trickling in the river
Is it the end of your long winter?
In anticipation, I quiver
Little by little
Inch by inch
You let me come in
Still a long journey ahead
For the river to join the ocean
We shall softly tread
Just enjoy the motion
Of the long ride
I just implore
To not to close yourself
We shall explore
The land of the elves
Laugh with me
Run with me
Dance with me
Explore with me
And
We shall run away with the key
To happiness"
568,Emotion,PassionPoemsPhPassionYourPassionPoembyBrianJohnston,"Your passion is permanently etched on my soul,
On all flesh, branding skin north and south.
Even after I have finished brushing my teeth
I can relive your taste in my mouth.
Your poems play new chords on the strings of my heart,
The mark your smile leaves? I'm still guessing!
But the magical way you've touched me from the start
Poetry has no way of expressing.
Though it's true that we have never met in the flesh
And no photograph I've ever seen.
Could it be a connection from many past lives?
Just the thought of you makes my world green.
The best artist could never capture the beauty
Of the truth you have let my heart see,
Only one thing could possibly soften this blow:
To know that in fact - you are for me."

570,Emotion,PassionPoemsASoliloquyOfTheFullMoonSheBeingInAMadPassionPoembySamuelTaylorColeridge,"Now as Heaven is my Lot, they're the Pests of the Nation!
Wherever they can come
With clankum and blankum
'Tis all Botheration, & Hell & Damnation,
With fun, jeering
Conjuring
Sky-staring,
Loungerin g,
And still to the tune of Transmogrification--
Those muttering
Spluttering
Ventriloquogusty
P oets
With no Hats
Or Hats that are rusty.
They're my Torment and Curse
And harass me worse
And bait me and bay me, far sorer I vow
Than the Screech of the Owl
Or the witch-wolf's long howl,
Or sheep-killing Butcher-dog's inward Bow wow
For me they all spite--an unfortunate Wight.
And the very first moment that I came to Light
A Rascal call'd Voss the more to his scandal,
Turn'd me into a sickle with never a handle.
A Night or two after a worse Rogue there came,
The head of the Gang, one Wordsworth by name--
`Ho! What's in the wind?' 'Tis the voice of a Wizzard!
I saw him look at me most terribly blue !
He was hunting for witch-rhymes from great A to Izzard,
And soon as he'd found them made no more ado
But chang'd me at once to a little Canoe.
From this strange Enchantment uncharm'd by degrees
I began to take courage & hop'd for some Ease,
When one Coleridge, a Raff of the self-same Banditti
Past by--& intending no doubt to be witty,
Because I'd th' ill-fortune his taste to displease,
He turn'd up his nose,
And in pitiful Prose
Made me into the half of a small Cheshire Cheese.
Well, a night or two past--it was wind, rain & hail--
And I ventur'd abroad in a thick Cloak & veil--
But the very first Evening he saw me again
The last mentioned Ruffian popp'd out of his Den--
I was resting a moment on the bare edge of Naddle
I fancy the sight of me turn'd his Brains addle--
For what was I now?
A complete Barley-mow
And when I climb'd higher he made a long leg,
And chang'd me at once to an Ostrich's Egg--
But now Heaven be praised in contempt of the Loon,
I am I myself I, the jolly full Moon.
Yet my heart is still fluttering--
For I heard the Rogue muttering--
He was hulking and skulking at the skirt of a Wood
When lightly & brightly on tip-toe I stood
On the long level Line of a motionless Cloud
And ho! what a Skittle-ground! quoth he aloud
And wish'd from his heart nine Nine-pins to see
In brightness & size just proportion'd to me.
So I fear'd from my soul,
That he'd make me a Bowl,
But in spite of his spite
This was more than his might
And still Heaven be prais'd! in contempt of the Loon
I am I myself I, the jolly full Moon."

With its flowing and its limits to share
Till all its touches become alright

Of the hours from down dark under
With its dances and beats to keep
As we drift though the waves asunder

Though I had my luck in its try
You are touching my soul here and only
Filling moments with each their try

582,Emotion,PassionPoemsTrilogyOfPassion03AtonementPoembyJohannWolfgangvonGoethe,"PASSION brings reason--who can pacify
An anguish'd heart whose loss hath been so great?
Where are the hours that fled so swiftly by?
In vain the fairest thou didst gain from fate;
Sad is the soul, confused the enterprise;
The glorious world, how on the sense it dies!
In million tones entwined for evermore,
Music with angel-pinions hovers there,
To pierce man's being to its inmost core,
Eternal beauty has its fruit to bear;
The eye grows moist, in yearnings blest reveres
The godlike worth of music as of tears.
And so the lighten'd heart soon learns to see
That it still lives, and beats, and ought to beat,
Off'ring itself with joy and willingly,
In grateful payment for a gift so sweet.
And then was felt,--oh may it constant prove!--
The twofold bliss of music and of love."
583,Emotion,PassionPoemsPassionPoembyMariaLuisaTaylor,"Passion for the stars
Passion for the ocean
A moment of passion so easily shared,
With no fear o regret.
Passion is the eagerness to wake up with the light
A moment of passion I'll never forget
My passion found me
And what is my passion?
Passion and lust takes my mind
Passion the power to love,
The speed of passion: Furios
Passion is something you see
Passion its something you are.

584,Emotion,PassionPoemsPassionOfFirePoembyMistralLove,"My heart was started by a spark,
burst into flames.
Now I am like a lamp on a hill,
everyone sees me and my passion.
I'm on fire, I'm burning bright.
You made the spark,
kindled the flame,
gave this fire the passion of the night.
Its burning bright, through the night,
its never going out or dimming.
Its the passion of the fire,
its the passion of life.
The life you gave,
was meant to amaze.
Now with you in me,
I illuminate the darkness.
I'm on fire,
running with the flame, the passion
touching people,
letting them catch the fire, catch your Love.
It never fades away,
this passion deep in me,
it'll burn till the end of day."
585,Emotion,PassionPoemsInQuestOfPassionPoembyDrsubhendukar,"As  wish - all the best of love
that may  whisper you reveling
very depth of light yet unplumbed
enlightened with wisdom of love
as blue moon beams luminous
when its spirit rocks the earth
as we may muse and sway
in our own glory of living resonant
the very excellence of gift
in the harvest of moon in unison
in our verse and universe,
being led away yet by the light of love
as bestowed upon as in search
to the quest of passion afloat
as we traverse our time
to excel in the path to shine
holding the hands together
yet a rave review as rooming
a stance as  when as aspired
to keep the soul blazing unified
in all being safe and sheltered"
586,Emotion,PassionPoemsShiveringWithPassionPoembyMorhardtCarmenMencitaMonoiAngel,"Shivering with passion
Shivering with passion
As soon as his lips on mine
Lust creeps up my whole spine
His large hands playing on me
All inches of body aching for more
Keep up your powerful skill
Withdraw my resistance out
To make me without any will
Just panting for him
Shivering with passion
Total body compatibility
No other way of serenity
Let it be let lust overcome
Any hidden upcoming fear
Throw and shut it out of mind
This passion is burning me blind
his touching with such dexterity
Absolute tremendous sensuality
Shivering with passion
For the moment nothing counts
Than feeling his real desire
Taking my body as part of his
Demanding responding his way
Waves of pleasures splashing
Into my very internal caves
Nobody ever did it so right
Till his soft open lips aroused mine
Shivering with passion
When starting to wet within
Asking for more to be explored
Pit in my stomach vibrations
Tongues searching to restore
Lost sensible sensations
Stretching in wonderful ways
Whole of myself arching
In pain to absolute surrender
Shivering with passion
Only once in lifetime can one find
Such a total flesh connection
This thirst and hunger of mine
To renew the encounters
More and many more times
How will I ever have the strength
To leave this outbursting lovemaking
Once consumed behind
I shall always shiver with
A certain kind of passion
When in the future surfaces
sudden warm thoughts of that
love making of the past"
587,Emotion,PassionPoemsPassionPoembyDeeDaffodil,"I hadn't seen her in close to a year
And so...we met for a simple lunch
I brought tuna sandwiches, strawberries and lattes
She brought her lovely smile!
I noticed that she had lost weight
And she seemd pale, to what I was used to
And the sparkle in her eye...
Was hidden...
We hugged, and then chatted
She was a dear friend...always there for me
And I had tried to always be there for her...
Except once...
I had long ago learned not to pass judgement
As we chatted, we kept the topics light
How was she doing?
How was my work?
How were my kids?
And, as we chatted, my mind wandered
Back to happier times...
She had always had such passion...
Passion for life...and passion for him
Their love had been the kind of passion
That you read about in romance novels!
That...rock you to the core...
Sweep you off your feet...
Rollercoaster ride! !
Secretly, I had always been envious
Of passion that strong...
My life paled in comparison
My marriage had become...
A business partnership...
And my passion...it lay deeply buried...
But the kind of passion that they had...
was also dark, and stormy at times
There had been several break ups
And then reunions...
But now...it was over...forever
And she was learning how to live her life
Without him
I thought that the sparkle in her eye
Must have gone, around the same time he did
The situation gripped me, and I fought back tears
With a lump in my throat
I couldn't help but notice
All the background noises
No birds, or babbling brooks for us today...
No...something far more sinister...
Clangs, bangs...and the odd shout
It was the end of our time together
And as we rose, we hugged again
And she clung to me
As though she never wanted to let go
And I never wanted to let go of her
If I could have taken her with me..
Then and there...I would have
She walked away...
Turned and waved a little wave
And I thought I saw
A tiny sparkle in her eye...once again
But then I realized it was just a tear
As I left, I reflected on the situation
Brought about by passion...such passion...
She had loved him...passionately
She had killed him...passionately!
Ohhhhh...what passion! !
(HW/31 May,2007)"
588,Emotion,PassionPoemsPassionPoembyMichaelJamesKennedyFindlay,"Passion
A red rose waiting to be given
A light touch on the arm
A cuddle close
A passionate kiss under the stars
A pen carefully handled to write a lover letter to a special person
A dance upon a dance floor before the sea
A slow walk upon the beach in the sunset
Passion
Existing in all of us, however deep"
589,Emotion,PassionPoemsLoveAndPassionPoembyUMBELINAFROTALinharesPimentaBastos,"Love is a breeze
of the dawn  caressing our skin,
Passion is a fire
which melts our heart.
Love is kindness
that touch and does not get aged,
Passion is a volcano
that blows up in eruption.
Love is a
lasting feeling,
Passion is a
transitory alienation.
Love is peace,
serenity,
complicity.
Passion is affliction,
suspicion,
desillusion.
Love is union
of two human beings
in communion,
Passion is conjunction
of bodies in ecstasy
and possession.

That it knows no end
Let my heart grow wings
And take flight again
Allow me such love
That I feel with each embrace
Overwhelming fires
That grow with the thrill of chase
Grant me such a kiss
That my heart escapes my chest
Such a beating against my ribs
That my pain tolerance is at test
Bestow upon me such Passion
That nothing else exists
Warm me with your arms
Bless me with your lips
Touch me with such tenderness
That I cannot believe
That such Passion could exist
Inside someone like me"

He, who had sacrificed
Endured the wounds and pain
Pardon for all our sins
Against the hands of the enemies
Shouldered the weight of humanity
Showering eternal glory
In this world ruled by evil
Overpouring mercy for our sins
No one at times noticed
Once there was a love...
Forever saving-love...
Covering us a mantle of His protection
He, who is the risen Lord...
Ressurected for the salvation of the world
In His love that we have forsaken
Sanctifying grace we have abandoned
Together now in spirit we commemorate...
THE PASSION OF CHRIST"

594,Emotion,PassionPoemsSuchIsThePassionPoembyGrahamJones,"Such is the passion the want of desire
To burn in the heart with fingers of fire
Wet lashes wrapped up, in a sweet velvet rose
To follow your heart where ever it goes
Such is the passion the heart strings to pull
That the cup runneth over, with emotions so full
To send you to heaven, the stars and above
To make senses reel in the sweet dance of love
Such is the passion in the depths of ones soul
Infuses ones mind and the dreams in the role
Of a lovers sweet kisses, to imprint its mark
Of secret assignations alone in the dark
Such is the passion the fire inside
Shines forth from the eyes, with nowhere to hide
Yet the heart and the mind, will tumble and fall
If signals mistaken, will then wither and stall."

596,Emotion,PassionPoemsMusicAndPassionAndMusicPoembyJonathanROBIN,"Mirrored echoes dance, shades leave behind
Upward spiral, circle higher still.
Shadow personae played out, heart and will,
Inside and out reflect hopes redefined.
Can this light true remain or wane? We find
At last trace of shared space to dreams fulfill.
Now answer Dear, do you, too, warm and chill?
Depth of feeling freed, hearts need to bind,
Passion parallel, to urge aligned,
As one, - tendril touching - surging thrill,
Sensations soothing dissonance to still
Secret fears, time's sentence purged, demined.
In gentleness soul strokes soul til release
ON wings of comfort comes, whole makes each piece.
Ph[r]ase by ph[r]ase, souls tenderly tendril,
Answer questions. Sun beneath the skin
Sensations warms, blood pulses fast to win
Satisfaction which can Trust instill.
In gentless soul strokes twin soul until
Only smiles sleep comforts, kin find kin.
No dream is this, which daylight will wear thin!
At last trace of shared space may dreams fulfill.
Now must your answer show our overspill!
Depth of feeling, harmony, begin
Mirrored dance where darkness seems a sin.
Upwards two halves united spin - no chill
Shadow portends which could kill - love unshared.
I, Charmed, disarmed, am for your smile prepared"

Yeah you made me hate to love you,
Now I hate myself.
So twist through time,
If you ever look back...
Admit you used me like the other damn Jacks!
So all that time you were lying?
All that time I was a fool?
Now this time I lay dying,
Drowning in this apathy pool,
These salted tears the gullable shed,
Well I've shed mine,
With guilt and dread,
Hear the voices,
Conscience in my head,
Now I can't trust it,
My conscience's dead.
Bittersweet, bitterweet tears run down,
All that time, I choked, I drowned,
I bled these thoughts again and again,
In my mind again, and again..."

but when that day came then you were not there for me
So much love showered and so many promises were made
but nothing worked on my way because you had gone
My love, I am crying for you because my love turned blue
The heaven stolen you from me and left the memories only
Though your soul vanished in the sky but my love never dies for you
I tell those angels how much I love you and care for you
and ask them to make your soul always happy till I come to you
My love, I am crying for you because my love turned blue
Looking at your photos and wish you were here with me
Crying for your endless love which become the end of story
I will not see you again but your memories will stay for ever
Now my heart fighting against a raw pain for the lost of my love
My love, I am crying for you because my love turned blue"
601,Emotion,LovePoemsLoveIsLoveIsNotPoembyFaySlimm,"LOVE IS
Always good mannered, bears up under stress
Looks for ways to be kindly, is quick to confess.
LOVE IS NOT
Ever possessive, nor needs to impress.
Not touchy, nor jealous if it seems to get less.
LOVE IS
Looking to share, and hopes for good things.
Knows no limits to taking what life sometimes brings
LOVE IS NOT
Proud or boastful, it does not feel revoked
By injuries suffered, nor is it provoked.
LOVE IS
Decent, believing, looking for good.
Contented, yet happy when misunderstood.
It's trusting, and hoping, as love always should.
Thus love begets love. It personifies God.
Lets hold  up the feelings we deem to call Love.
Comparing them close in the light of above."

from who's mommy's little treasure then,
sticks this silver thing to block her ear
and starts talking to thin air

Let all creation find
That truth is always in our mouth
And peace is on our mind
Let’s live our lives to others now
Let’s touch The Father’s heart
To Jesus let our knees but bow
From evil take no part
Until the world’s is Satan free
Till Jesus reigns supreme
Let’s help our blinded neighbours see
That life is not a dream
Let empathy become our creed
Compassion wear a crown
Plant in the world a thoughtful seed
Bedecked with selfless gown
To fellow man, do no more wrong
Our neighbours cause no ruin
Let love become our living song
And dance alone its tune
However high we pay the price
Let love become our guide
Let hate become our sacrifice
On altars far and wide
Its love its love its always love
That melts a heart of stone
So let its fruit from God above
Transform our flesh and bone
Let neighbours see the joy within
Love’s fruit give free to eat
Encourage them to walk from sin
And sit at Jesus feet"

608,Emotion,LovePoemsLiveTheLifeYouLoveLoveTheLifeYouLivePoembyKathrynMarieThurman,"Through all the injustice making life not fair,
the world is choking, gasping for air.
Even though people differ in color, beliefs, and tongues,
we all have love in our hearts and air in our lungs.
When all we do is discriminate,
all that shows is the evils of mans hate.
To reverse this world-wide tragedy,
people have to stop and realize that their acting like gravity.
Breaking people down like a dictator of hate,
the world works for the rich with no debate.
behind every cheap dollar top,
there is a child wasting away in a third-world shop.
Engraved in the treads are the blood and tears,
of the little children expressing their fears.
Although we think that this could not be true,
the world works so shady, not caring what other people must go through."
609,Emotion,LovePoemsToLoveOrNotToLovePoembyKathrynThompson,"To Love Or Not To Love
That is the question
Should or shouldn't we
To know love
To be love
You've got to feel love
You've got to know
When your in love
Or not
Do you know how it fills
To be in love
You've got to feel it
It feels so good to be in love
Your head rushes
Your heart beats
A million beats a minute
You can't stand it
When you have to be away
From him/ her for long periods of time
You think about him/ her 24/7
You dream about him/ her
You day dream about him/ her
To love or not to love
To love you've got to know
The risk of what happens
After you love
Not to love you've got to know
That this is really what you want
To feel love you've got to be love
You've got to love him your self
That is why
To love or not to love
Is and has always been
The main question of loving
This is why most people love
Know that they know every thing
About the person and the risks
This is why we love
Because we love him/ her
This is why we don't love
You don't know the person that well
Love and be happy
Or
Not love and be misserble
So I love
Just like others should too"
610,Emotion,LovePoemsInLoveWithLovePoembyAkuaAchampong,"Here sits a boy so in love with this girl,
But he won't say a word cause it sets him in a whirl.
And it won't stop spinning untill he can find
some rest, reassurance or peace of mind,
That this girl that he loves so very much wil be in his arms
to hold and touch.
All that he wants is for this girl to caress
But he can't possibly cause his heads such a mess.
And he desperatley longs and hopes for the day that he can openly but honestly say,
'i love you more than anythingelse, even more than life itself'."
611,Emotion,LovePoemsSonnet10YetLoveMereLoveIsBeautifulIndeedPoembyElizabethBarrettBrowning,"X
Yet, love, mere love, is beautiful indeed
And worthy of acceptation. Fire is bright,
Let temple burn, or flax; an equal light
Leaps in the flame from cedar-plank or weed:
And love is fire. And when I say at need
I love thee . . . mark! . . . I love thee—in thy sight
I stand transfigured, glorified aright,
With conscience of the new rays that proceed
Out of my face toward thine. There's nothing low
In love, when love the lowest: meanest creatures
Who love God, God accepts while loving so.
And what I feel, across the inferior features
Of what I am, doth flash itself, and show
How that great work of Love enhances Nature's."
612,Emotion,LovePoemsslowTheLoveSerpentOfLovePoembySadiqullahKhan,"The sun went down for the night to cover
The earth that lay bare in front of me
Like the face you hide for the lover to adore
The curves and lines the dusk of your beauty
Like dark clouds pattering the aroma of earth
The sketch on coal on the white of moon
The river convulsing in matriarchal rage
When I was the shore infinite for the deluge
Overflowing and exuding like volcano
On the sand I made and made again
From the moon the sketch I remember
The reflection in the river with a soul
It was like the jewel on your forehead
The wounds on my heart when I blow
Who says forgetfulness I have acquired
Nothing is left of me for my self to know
Eloquence I add to words like music
In counterpoint when it turns on itself
Like the lock of your hair that touches
The cheek and the lips when they speak
In the colors of fire thou appear to me
Remove my name from the verse of venom
Thou shalt be Cleopatra and thou shalt take
Thy life with lust to be bitten by serpent
The serpent of love that thou playeth with
And when my blood thou shall rub on thy cheek
And mourn the beaten bosom for the lost love

Every second I relive the moments I had with you
Enjoying every second I heard I love you too
It's been forever since a smile has ever lasted on my face
Because no other has ever come close to every taken your place
At times it seems pointless like we were never meant to be
But then there are times I should just wait and see
I still wait and hang on to a slim glimpse of hope
Because losing you was something I just couldn't cope

Love someone else
Is the hardest thing you can do.
But did they know that it
Can also snap you in two?
Rip out your heart and disconnect
Your soul,
Make you weep every night alone
In the cold,
From being alive and ok with things,
Your mind turns to black,
And the hatred it brings
Makes you aware of yourself,
For better, for worse,
In sickness, in health,
Suddenly it seams
You’re in your own personal hell
You know not from where
It was that you fell,
And all this because
I love you with all,
But all I got in return
Was another brick wall."

622,Emotion,LovePoems02LoveLoveLovePoembyjohntiongchunghoo,"i wish to be the air you breathe
love that floods your every cell
revitalising you, cheering you up
every second of your life
i love like the rush of the Nile, Yangtze -
listen, listen to this lovelorn heart,
holding on, letting go, holding on
with such tenacity to the hope
of every lovelorn night
an eclipse helps distill
my love for you,
seals your charms, allure
from the craving prying eyes
of the world, precipitates that
momentuous silhouette,
escapade for me and you
sun and moon, yin and yang
to be totally absorbed
in bliss, in each other
love, love, love
if only i could be the only star
to win your fancy
for that sparkling while
heaven the world would become"
623,Emotion,LovePoemsLove5InLoveWithLovePoembyDrGeetaRadhakrishnaMenon,"In Love!
But……………………..
Not with love that dazzles and disappears,
Not with love that rejects and recedes,
Not with love that deliberates and deceives,
Not with love that demands and dominates!
I am not in love with any of these,
I am in love with ‘Love' itself!
Love that is unquestionable,
Love that is unpretentious,
Love that is unpremeditated,
Love that is unparalleled!
Yes! In love with love-
Love that is pure bliss!"
624,Emotion,LovePoemsLoveIsLovePoembyMarvinBratoSr,"I can not fathom, the reasons
nor understand the significance
why does love just blossoms
in the garden of the heart's stance
and grows abundantly
at any given chance
Love I suppose, is freedom
of the heart and soul
It exists to sooth boredom
and brings zest to all
No matter what it does
Its nativity is a call
For love is love
Boundless and true"
625,Emotion,LovePoemsBeforeILoveILostMyLovePoembyRaviSathasivam,"I remember that day when we came to know each other
We had a good chat and shared with all our views
That day and night, I could not sleep and kept on watching
all those stars in the sky and thinking of you
The moments we shared were so special and unforgettable
You were so shy and young to say or do anything about it
I felt that I was in love with you
I want to tell you that how much I love you
I want to tell you what I feel for you
I want to tell you that when I think of you my heart twist inside
But at that time I thought it was to soon to tell you
Since I was working in another city, I could not meet you
My days have past with your loving thoughts
I was counting my days to get back to you
and tell you what was stored in my mind for only you
I felt my warm of love with you would melt the winter snows
Suddenly I received a message from your friend
that you had an accident and died in the hospital
I was so shocked and a tear runs down my cheek
My dream with you was shattered and everything
I believed is not here, you have gone to heaven
I know deep in my soul that I will not see you until it's my time
Before I start my love with you, I have lost my love
Now I sit all alone in my room as memories unfold
May be you might hear my cry and beating of my heart in pain forever
I miss you my love where ever you are always

626,Emotion,LovePoemsLoveIsLoveIsBecauseItIsWhatLoveIsPoembyYaritzaFlorencio,"Love is the coin in the fountain
The wish that’s never granted
Love is the night sky that has more stars than you need
But less stars than you want
Love is that story that doesn’t have a clear ending
And no matter what you do, you can’t imagine a happy one
Love is that sky with only a single cloud
And just when you need the sunlight it creeps in front of the sun
And the light goes out
Love is that mark on you
The one you were born with
Want to get rid of
But wouldn’t be the same without
Love is that little tree standing lonely on field
You always think it’s in the way
But really it makes the field what it is
Love is the sand on the beach
Alone a grain of sand is nothing
Together it’s everything
Love is the river
It may look calm and still
But the truth is it never really stops
And you can never step in the same river twice
Love is what makes me write this poem….its what makes you read it
It’s the gravity that holds you down
And the air that can raise you up
It’s the force that moves you
And the wall that makes you stop
Its way you live
And the reason you want to die
But it’s also the reason you keep holding on
It’s the hope that gives us miracles
And the bad times that make you appreciate the good.
Its way I love you guys you see….
And the way you guys love me…"
627,Emotion,LovePoemsLoveAsSelfSelfAsLovePoembyMichaelShepherd,"We do not have to seek for love
nor fear it ever go:
but simply, rest within ourself;
then, love perforce must flow:
for who’s the sweetest company,
as parent, sister, brother?
Those restful ones, always themself;
as one who knows no other..
*
[This came after watching ‘The Big Sing’:
every seat in the Albert Hall taken
by those singing their hearts out
to fine words; while simultaneously and
in unsought parallel, love flowed..]"
628,Emotion,LovePoemsslowTheLovePureLovePoembySadiqullahKhan,"I know where shall he go
Seven seas or oceans as he lives
In my heart of flesh and emotions deep
No gold I want but love forlorn
From earth to heaven stars and moon
With one glance of love he shall be mine
Away the seductress the arms you bare
My lips parched of my garment unaware
And thou sayest my love thou steal
My love so pure so pure like a child
From Eden descended and anointed with waters
That I brought from my spring of love

629,Emotion,LovePoemsIDoNotLoveYouExceptBecauseILoveYouPoembyPabloNeruda,"I do not love you except because I love you;
I go from loving to not loving you,
From waiting to not waiting for you
My heart moves from cold to fire.
I love you only because it's you the one I love;
I hate you deeply, and hating you
Bend to you, and the measure of my changing love for you
Is that I do not see you but love you blindly.
Maybe January light will consume
My heart with its cruel
Ray, stealing my key to true calm.
In this part of the story I am the one who
Dies, the only one, and I will die of love because I love you,
Because I love you, Love, in fire and blood."
630,Emotion,LovePoemsTheWeightOfLoveLoveLoveLoveLovePoembyUdiahwitnesstoYah,"I once was asked concerning love versus hate
Why does it seem that hate is so great?
While hate is a very strong emotion too
Nothing can equal love that is true
The weight of hate is very heavy to bear
While it seems like love is lighter than air
Accounts of hate make a big news headline
While actions of love you must look hard to find
But when you consider that love is patient, kind,
Envieth not, not pompous, not puffed up, not rude,
Seeketh not her own, slow to anger, thinks no evil,
Rejoices not in wrong doing, but rejoices in the truth,
Bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things,
Endures all things, and never fails*
You soon learn that the density of love is so much,
Although the scales be heaped with a great volume of hate
It's catapulted by a mere measure of love's touch,
Love strengthens the bearer so one feels not its weight

631,Emotion,LovePoemsLoveLoveLoveInLovePoembyYiannisBaki,"Love is the salt, in the life-meal
If you taste it unsalted, many times hurt you feel
Love is something real, you cant pretend
If you have no feelings, give it an end
Love is a combination, that join two
Makes them one with passion true
Love is to feel good with all your deeds
When the phrase 'crazy change' your life leeds"
632,Emotion,LovePoemsLoveGoneLoveGonePoembyAnnBeard,"Even In sleep the old man weeps,
his heartbeat a throb, love gone - love gone.
Each moment too long since he held her tight,
swaying heart to cheek to his favourite song.
He carries the burden of mournful flight,
swooping and gliding - the highs - the lows.
To tearfully soak through the solace of wit,
whistle through lungs and in-between toes.
Day after day the old man weeps,
his footsteps echo -  love gone - love gone.
The sun burns an imprint of dust on his face
There is no-one to lay his heart down upon.
At dusk unfamiliar shadows brush past.
he curses the moon so whole and bright.
screams - at the stars that continue to shine.
asks again, and again, who gave them the right.
One night in his bed the old man slept
his pulse wants to race love gone - love gone,
Then a peaceful smile crept over his face,
and he willed himself follow, go on - go on.

633,Emotion,LovePoemsLoveIsFoundIsLovePoembyJoLynnEhnesAllen,"Love
is found;
enraptured
are two, then shared
are understanding
and trust entwined with truth.
Defined are dreams and romance;
aroused are emotions inside;
whenever destiny is working.

Working is destiny whenever
inside emotions are aroused.
Romance and dreams are defined.
Truth with entwined trust and

634,Emotion,LovePoemsHardLoveWhichIsHarderLoveOrHatePoembyChinaJones,"Hard is the love couples share as they try to reveal the love they share-
The words aren't there, hard to find, hard to seek. Love is hard and also blind when you try to hide,  and when you know its there.
Love is hard the up and downs, highs and lows, tares and snares
Hard to show and let them know the ones who know nothing about you
or the ones you can't stand are the ones who you should love
If you had show some form of love that one person you needed, was not
there now you are should've, could've, would've
because there was no love in your heart, hard love is the main thing of -
this world we live in
Love is hard in the place we call earth, Love isn't found not from
our indiviual peers, but from the citizens of America
Harder is love, hate comes easy
Is love hard because we don't know how or is love harder because
we don't care?
Love is blind- which is hard, hard to give, or hard to recieve
Which is harder Love or Hate?
I say love because we know its there but we simply ignore the presence of love, and hide in the darkness of the shadows of the issues of the world, only to hope on the light of LoVe."
635,Emotion,LovePoemsLoveLoveAndLoveAllOverPoembyMAsimNehal,"She took away my fears
and opened my heart
like a letter
and found written
Love, love and love
all over."
636,Emotion,LovePoemsLoveAndPoetryPoetryAndLovePoembyMichaelShepherd,"and right now, I’m spending most of my time
on the two matters of which I seem to know the least –
love; and poetry.
maybe it’s good I feel like this; after all,
they’re two pretty big things in their way;
and if it’s frustrating that
I don’t seem to get anywhere,
or understand any more,
maybe that’s good too since
it keeps me at it
and out of harm’s way
as they say
let’s take poetry first – that’s
relatively straightforward:
one day I love the freedom
of the current situation – there’s no rules
except, the lines are short –
but even that, you can break
with ‘prose poems’ (and leave it
to others to say when 'prose poems'
become ‘poetic prose’ etc…) :
tell the unvarnished truth,
tell it like it is; offer all your heart
ungiftwrapped;
then next day I miss the music
of a poem that – with some difficulty –
rhymes and dances in its rhythms,
catches you in its woven spell,
reads as if it wrote itself,
sings its own fair song,
even though of course
the rhyme then makes you deviate
from the theme – but that can take you to
more interesting places in the mind —
so - point of this - I’m none the wiser
about what poetry is; though of course
maybe there’s some benefit I just don’t spot
by kinda mixing thisnthat..
so, when I’m not writing this stuff
that I call poetry, if I call it anything,
I’m addressing the question
of love; in the hope
that thinking about it might just be
of some use; influence action; and
make me more loving; or help me
write poetry about it, ha..
well don’t ask me, not just yet..
though, we all know what love is...
when it’s on our side?
one day, I feel good that I’ve spent the day
reading inspiring words, like,
the whole Creation is one single act
of love; that it brought the whole universe
into manifestation; sustains it; merges all things into love;
that love is knowledge; holds all forms
through law, by law; that law and love
are always together; that love’s
the natural state of ourself; that
every creature has pure love within its nature;
that thus, it’s our very nature
to love one another; love
our neighbour as ourself…
even, love ourselves...
then the next day, I can’t bear
to read any more of what’s written
about love; just spend the day in love
with everything and everyone;
being still a little, listening to music a little,
reading inspiring poetry a little,
going out or not going out,
being just myself a lot; seeing things around
inside the house and out
so vividly, it’s like being high
without the before and after, and
I wonder why it isn’t
always just like this..
then the next day again, I’m just too busy
to give thought to thinking about love,
or being loving to those bloody neighbours
then the doorbell rings – and
I greet whoever it is before
I even look at them, as if
they’re the one person out of all the world
I most wanted to see again right now – and
it’s someone to read the meter –'hallo!
what, again so soon? I’ve only just paid
the last bill, and anyway, it always comes
as ‘estimated’, and too high…'
too late – I’ve loved them totally
in that first moment; I'm like
someone else; I find myself
treating them like an honoured guest;
see them out with a friendly comment; feel good;
a sorta indifferent, unthought, unshaped happiness..
maybe there’s something to be discovered
in all this love thing,
whatever it is.. maybe
I’ll go try to write a poem about it,
see where it goes
[This poem is dedicated to the memory of Bukowski, the poet
who taught us to write it like it is - even if his later work...]"

I hate you because I love you,
and because I love you, I hate you !
I love you because you have the sensibility
and the fondness contained in a loving tear,
but I hate you when you are a lot of hidden memories.
I love you because I love you,
and because I love you, I hate you !
I love you because you are divine engineering,
but I hate you because I don't deserve you at the nightfall.
I love you because I love you,
and because I hate you, I love you! !
I love you because you are my life,
but I hate you because you are my death
and in the face of this great dilemma
I will die hating you...
to resuscitate loving you! !"
639,Emotion,LovePoemsFallingInLoveWithLovePoembyPeterSQuinn,"Falling in love with love,
There's nothing like this,
Become like someone you love,
Is what I hope for and miss.
My love is lonely tonight,
When the stars shine on so bright,
What is for me now right,
Is perhaps all out of sight?
Falling for someone like you,
Is it just impossible?
Why is my heart so blue?
Am I just another fool?
The night is ascending,
Dark hours coming in soon,
My wishes comprehending
In shadows from the moon.
Falling in love with love,
There's nothing like this,
Become like the one you love,
Is it impossible to wish?
Now in this gleaming light,
Perhaps I've lost my flight,
But I shall hold on so tight,
Never give up on that fight."

White says love me
Never, Ever, Never
My heart say nevermore.
White gives peace
White gave me pollution
White sowed purity
White spoiled my chastity.
White is superior
It made me inferior
White is cultured
It destroyed my culture.

Like inside my dream,
Here and there yesteryear
Puffing up lofty stream;
Spring is once again near
With morning so plentiful,
Winter on its underwear
The last of the frosty jewel.
Love oh love is coming now
Blooms soon starting to show,
Worries die out somehow
With the last winter's blow;
Give me a hope in the living
That will follow a sunny day,
There is so much worth giving
In the beginning of new May.
Love oh love is here to share
With wonderful thing to be,
To heal the old shallow arr
That once were here adoptee;
Spring's again nearly born
Filling my longings and wish,
What in earth ways I adorn
I can't be without all this."
643,Emotion,LovePoemsSonnetXYetLoveMereLovePoembyElizabethBarrettBrowning,"Yet, love, mere love, is beautiful indeed
And worthy of acceptation. Fire is bright,
Let temple burn, or flax; an equal light
Leaps in the flame from cedar-plank or weed:
And love is fire. And when I say at need
I love thee
...mark!...
I love thee
--in thy sight
I stand transfigured, glorified aright,
With conscience of the new rays that proceed
Out of my face toward thine. There's nothing low
In love, when love the lowest: meanest creatures
Who love God, God accepts while loving so.
And what I
feel,
across the inferior features
Of what I
am,
doth flash itself, and show
How that great work of Love enhances Nature's."

That is going on in the sky
Right now
His love
Is very special
Because he is giving
It to us right now"
645,Emotion,LovePoemsLoveLoveLovePoembyMichaelShepherd,"Oh it's so easy to say -

646,Emotion,LovePoemsModernLoveXxviLoveEreHeBleedsPoembyGeorgeMeredith,"Love ere he bleeds, an eagle in high skies,
Has earth beneath his wings: from reddened eve
He views the rosy dawn. In vain they weave
The fatal web below while far he flies.
But when the arrow strikes him, there's a change.
He moves but in the track of his spent pain,
Whose red drops are the links of a harsh chain,
Binding him to the ground, with narrow range.
A subtle serpent then has Love become.
I had the eagle in my bosom erst:
Henceforward with the serpent I am cursed.
I can interpret where the mouth is dumb.
Speak, and I see the side-lie of a truth.
Perchance my heart may pardon you this deed:
But be no coward:--you that made Love bleed,
You must bear all the venom of his tooth!"
647,Emotion,LovePoemsLoveBeingInLoveButLoveDonTLoveTheePoembyTiffanySaxon,"For thy heart beats of pain.
For it yearns for love
Yet, love is not on the scale
of gain.
For thy heart is slowly beating
away..
For the cries and heartache
seems to never end
For it is here to stay.
Through thy hidden fears..
only thy cries speaks very
loudly.
For at one time..it was disguised
with smiles very proudly.
Yet, no one seems to notice the pain
that grows inside of thee.
For thy have kneeled on thines
knees..asking...
'is this how it's gonna be? '
Trust
Devotion
and Love is not in the picture,
For trine heart is broken and
crushed into different measures and
mixtures.
For how thy pray to the heavens for
love.
For one can only wait for the
answer  from way up above.
For thy love being in love....
but ones discovered that love don't
love thee.
For time has passed..love seems to
hide from thee.
How can this be?
For one feels that love is not meant
for thee.
Hoping
Wishing
and Praying that love is for thee.
Hopefully a miracle will come and
open thy eyes..So thy can see that
love is there for thee.
But until then...thy' Love Being In Love..
But Love Don't  Love Thee.'
The End!"

The union of this ever-diverse pair!
These two were rapid falcons in a snare,
Condemned to do the flitting of the bat.
Lovers beneath the singing sky of May,
They wandered once; clear as the dew on flowers:
But they fed not on the advancing hours:
Their hearts held cravings for the buried day.
Then each applied to each that fatal knife,
Deep questioning, which probes to endless dole.
Ah, what a dusty answer gets the soul
When hot for certainties in this our life!--
In tragic hints here see what evermore
Moves dark as yonder midnight ocean's force,
Thundering like ramping hosts of warrior horse,
To throw that faint thin line upon the shore!"
652,Emotion,LovePoemsLoveAndLossAndLoveAgainAPoemForJennyAndHerFriendsPoembyMichaelShepherd,"Loss can be good for us,
researchers say (Nolen-Hoeksema
and Davis,2002)   – it’s called
Post-Traumatic Growth…
When we ‘lose’ someone
we seldom see these days,
yet always love, we are in some strangely beautiful way
the gainers –
lose someone who, caught a glimpse of
down a school corridor, is like
a mirror in which you’ll see reflected
yourself as nothing but pure love…
and when you meet her then, it’s just as if
you meet love – and a modesty almost uncertain:
as if she had been  bestowed the awesome gift
of a part of sun and sunlight, and told,
bestow this wisely…
warmth, and light, and beautiful humility –
even your great talent – I recall
a rare and radiant press review
of a concert in the Purcell Room
where you improvised on, was it, Ravel..?
and when asked why you never built
upon that boost, you said with typical
serious thought, well people don’t seem
to be interested in that sort of thing…
so, the occasional concert; and another
undeveloped gift, for bringing together in opera
people who would never have dared
to seek the gift of singing in themselves…
so, we the gainers in this sad yet joyful way:
we saw you just occasionally; now,
as often as we remember you,
you’re here again, as love.. just, love…
my only sadness, Jennifer,
is that one day, when on your face
(never tell a lady to her face
about her face – yet I insult you
by saying that of you…)
on your face I saw the look
of a little girl who’d done her very best,
yet feared retribution…what demon,
small or large, had you to deal with in yourself?
I regretted then, not speaking out
and asking you about that; yet
you, with your great talent to bring love
were better equipped than I; too wise,
I think, not to know yourself…
for what you brought in your sweet nature –
taking work where it would offer,
playing the piano for a celebrated
but also modest ballet teacher,
playing a white grand piano next to a fern
in Heathrow’s nerve-strained hall…
what you brought was the essence of
that Indian ‘Perfect Prayer’ which so many speak
but not all live out: that nothing can be ‘taken’,
for the remainder is always perfect…
so we will mourn, or celebrate, dear Jenny:
we who were so fortunate,
and who shall remain  blessed for ever
that you have lived on earth..
‘sweet are the uses of adversity’ – for
there’s music in our souls

653,Emotion,LovePoemsPrimevalMyLoveForTheWomanILovePoembyWaltWhitman,"PRIMEVAL my love for the woman I love,
O bride! O wife! more resistless, more enduring than I can tell, the
thought of you!
Then separate, as disembodied, the purest born,
The ethereal, the last athletic reality, my consolation,
I ascend--I float in the regions of your love, O man,
O sharer of my roving life."
654,Emotion,LovePoemsBirdsSingILoveYouLovePoembyAugustaDaviesWebster,"Birds sing ""I love you, love"" the whole day through,
And not another song can they sing right;
But, singing done with, loving's done with quite,
The autumn sunders every twittering two.
And I'd not have love make too much ado
With sweet parades of fondness and delight,
Lest iterant wont should make caresses trite,
Love-names mere cuckoo ousters of the true.
Oh heart can hear heart's sense in senseless nought,
And heart that's sure of heart has little speech.
What shall it tell? The other knows its thought.
What shall one doubt or question or beseech
Who is assured and knows and, unbesought,
Possesses the dear trust that each gives each."
655,Emotion,LovePoemsLove11LoveValentineLovePoembyDrGeetaRadhakrishnaMenon,"Valentine - A mark of love's effervescence,
Verily! Love's romantic exuberances,
Villa of charming red roses,
Vivacious love's beautiful expressions!
Vineyard of sweet whisperings,
Vivid display of love's embraces,
Velvet, silk, touches and kisses,
‘Vitamin L' that sustains and nourishes!
Voyage of memories and praises
Vows to remain steadfast and uphold promises,
Valuable diamonds that dazzle and sparkle,
Variegated colours and exotic perfumes!
Verdict of impeccable valentine's celebrations,
Veritable fare of love's infallible declarations!

656,Emotion,LovePoemsLostLoveLoveLoveLoveLoveLoveLovePoembyUdiahwitnesstoYah,"Void, empty, hollow inside
My dreams have fled, my hopes have died
Existence has no reason
Life's just passing with each season
She was my life, my hope, my love
All is gone, passed by thereof
The hurt is such no one should bear
What's to life, why should I care?
I weep all night for my love gone
My heart is sick, for death I long
Mine eyes well tears for love that's lost
I'll mourn always for the great cost
But in each day Lord give me hope
Strengthen me so I may cope
Grant me wisdom to help me see
Thy great way and not just me.

When 'if' lay between you and I
And 'never' seemed forever
I fell to earth in surrender
And you became the centre of my eye
Love is.....
When I pass by you accidentally
I grab a sense of your smile
When between us is distance measured by the mile
I grab a sense of our love immeasurably
Love will be.....
When I can no longer see to see
When I can no longer hear to hear
I know you will be near
Simply just you and me
Love eternally.....
When God granted us our wish finally
He put in us a throbbing heart
When it stops from this earth we will depart
But our Love will live eternally

663,Emotion,LovePoemsLovesBeautifulLoveUntaintedLoveUnassumingMckLoveAScorpionNeedsPoembyMargaretAlice,"Love's Beautiful
I was scared of love -
love was a slap in the face
when I did something wrong
and it got to mom
love is a chase and breaking
my favourite stuff
When parents gave love
they spiced it with hate
when friends gave love
they set conditions and rules
when you love me
is it duty-free -
what is the dividends?
You reminded me how
I completely withdrew
from all forms of life
and lived in a book
so much so that closing the book
stopped me breathing and being
only words on paper
words in a song, music playing
was existence for me...
Feed me love
to fill my cup
with loving feelings
that I can carry with me
wherever I go -
I didn't trust mom
when I was small
and since then
I didn't trust men
I discovered
my father’s love
but recently
he is violent but true
never lies to you
Are you a dream -
whatever the reality
love's a beautiful
phenomenon…
Love Still Untainted
Listening to Mozart’s Piano Concerto*
on the radio – violins are the light
of stars flickering, shimmering, the
piano says of the birth of a beautiful
love in the heart of a man; maimed in
its manifestation by callous hands,
its beauty never reaching the heart
of the beloved one. That love is still
untainted and as sweet as this lovely
composition: will the love of my father
for my mother endure until its revelation
in the life hereinafter –
enduring unto eternity…?
*Concerto No.21 in C
Love Unassuming For M.C.K.
And then you came
and spoke about consideration
and I thought: Where's warm love?
and spoke about alienation
and I thought: Where's the passion?
and focused on doing the right thing
and consistency and loyalty and quiet love
and I thought: What is that thing
called love that is so unassuming?
I thought love was all-consuming...
and that after the fire had burnt out
nothing would remain
but your love kept on burning
with a pure and beautiful flame
and awakened such  sweet love in me
filled me with such a feeling of security
that left my blighted youth behind
so that today I find
I love you even more than before
Love a Scorpion & Needs Of Another
To Love A Scorpion
I used to cry
when you stung me
with your honesty
and angry attacks
I thought if you
loved me, you would
not be angry with me
for being fearful and scared
Then I read
people show their love
differently,  there are
codes of love – when we
understand the character
of a loved one, we’ll be
able to discern the love
clothed in idiosyncrasy
When I saw your
Astrogenetic sign:
Scorpio – with the sting
in the tail; it is your
nature to be brutally
honest, to judge mercilessly,
a light went on for me:
a Scorpion’s love does entail
merciless attack, not for lack
of love; but because of it -
without love, you destroy completely
with love, you are authoritative
Difficult as it may be
I love my Scorpion
together we soar
you’re an eagle – when you’re glad
Together we crawl
in the dust – when you’re sad
together we burn up
in the heat of your anger
but like the phoenix
we rise again – reborn
after your emotional storm:
Now I know
your code of love
and why you attack,
I can deal with it
in a new way – and
my Astrogenetic sign
gives me permission
to cry enough
to wash all the pain
away!
Make Way For The Needs Of Another
Nobody said relationships were easy -
we are both in love with love, though
you cannot cope with the quick ebb and
flow of my emotions – your feelings
change slowly  while mine are in flux –
I keep my pose when dealing with you;
not wishing to rock the boat – sometimes
regretting that I can’t be me – but then,
I have poetry to write it all down, deal with
the sting of jealousy, manipulation and
arrogance – and woe is me when I point
out these traits – so let’s keep the peace;
I’m proud of the way you pursue these
demons of yours - fighting relentlessly;
weighing pros and cons we can make things
work; please do not be so unforgiving; let’s
make room for the failings of others, let’s
visit the Queen of Hearts and my sister the
Duchess someday; let’s start with a
clean slate and make way for the
needs of another..."
664,Emotion,LovePoemsLoveIsLoveIsLoveAValentineRepPoembyFrankJamesRyanJr,"_________Author's Prologue____________
Originally written for my (then) 12 year old daughter
on her challenge for me to write a rhyming poem in
less than ten minutes, with a love theme story line to
boot... this is what I was able to conjure up. As a rule
I am not a great fan of rhyming poetry, tho' I have
written some over the years. However, in this one
special case I must admit indulging in my daughter's
challenge...and was very glad that I took her up on it.
Now,24, she still rides me now and again in how she
conned me into writing a rhyming love poem! It was on
the PH Top 500 Poems List from 2006-2012(topping out at
#68) in 2007. Unfortunately, the work was accidently deleted by me,
so, I thought I'd resurrect it one more time...........FjR
..................................... ................................................. .
LOVE...Is...LOVE...Is...LOVE...
I t's the kiss......before the goodnight
It's the bliss after dimming the light
It's the memories....of special day's
It's the tempering.....clouds of grey
It's the turn.....of one's other cheek
It's the silence before the arm reach
It's the excitement of your first date
It's the enlightenment..... you create
It's the shoes...you leave at the door
It's the muse.....you call your amour
It's the sharing.....of wine and seeds
It's the caring...to honor and please
It's the start of your day's in the sun
It's the hearts of 2......that beat as 1
It's the diamond shopping...at Kay's
It's the roses........on Valentine's Day
It's the sunset.......you nestled under
It's the lightning.....'fore the thunder
It's the morning they call 'The After'
It's the yawning.....and the laughter
It's the healing.......of passions scars
It's the feeling its cures' in the heart
It's the action of words..you profess
It's the passion.......and nothing less
It's the passion.......and nothing less

665,Emotion,LovePoemsMyLoveAndOnlyLovePoembyMaryWismer,"I don't always tell you
that the joy you bring,
brightened my way.
The years you've made
happy by sharing you cared!
I don't always tell you,
that the love you give brightens every day I live.
I'm thinking today of all that we've shared.
You've given encouragement, brightened my ways.
But the most important part of all
my Cherished hopes and plans and dreams.
You've listened to problems, always known what to say.
you mean more to me than anything.
I don't always tell you, how much I loved you!
The memories we've known, all the laughter and fun.
And I just want to say on this day, I set apart.

668,Emotion,LovePoemsWhyDoWeLoveLoveWhenLoveSeemsToHateUsPoembyLaKiraJackson,"Why do we love love so much when it never did us any good,
We love love for the fun of it, or just because we know we could.
But the question is, why do love hate us,
I always said, ' It's better love than lust.'
Love hates us because we never show ownership,
We just see each other as friends, we don't even see a relationship.
Love doesn't hate us, it's just we abuse it so,
Because once love is given to us, we don't want it anymore.
We do love love, and love loves us too,
Love is just tired of the different ways it's used."

when, with elation
you will greet yourself arriving
at your own door, in your own mirror
and each will smile at the other's welcome,
and say, sit here. Eat.
You will love again the stranger who was your self.
Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart
to itself, to the stranger who has loved you
all your life, whom you ignored
for another, who knows you by heart.
Take down the love letters from the bookshelf,
the photographs, the desperate notes,
peel your own image from the mirror.
Sit. Feast on your life."
673,Emotion,LovePoemsLovePoemsAboutLovePoemsAboutLovePoemsAboutLovePoemsAboutLovePoemsAboutLovePoemsAboutLovePoemsAboutLovePoemsAboutPoembyChuyAmante,"This is a LOVE poem about all the poems I love, about love, poems...
All who have tasted the finest love,
speak the same language.
It can be recognized by the heart!
All this music, of love-poetry we play,
a beauteous symphony,
felt by whom? ignored by most,
we host truth.
All other verse that resonates not,
comes from brilliant, intellectual thought.
Do you want to read about Barbecued ribs, or EAT them?
Even if I describe them well?
Their tenderness and juicy smell...
Do you want to learn about love
and then pass-on your knowledge?
Sounding like you are learned and
right the hell out of college!
Or...
Get roped and dragged in, beaten...
Then nursed and recover,
from loves first round with you?
Not yet even have you had a taste!
Little do you know it will SLAY YOUR SOUL, left to bitter WASTE!
Young ones you love
and passionate you are,
but it is a bar game
or in the back of a car.
The love that is real,
is the love that may kill you,
rip you to shreds
and your guts it will spill you!
From the top of the mountain
to the bottom of the pit,
You will crash down after flying
and be done with that $#it!
From that flight on fire
and the crash so violent,
that is from where the spark re-bursts ~ forth,
before the fuel re-ignites...
I'll leave it there, a common language amongst lovers,
a total mystery to those who seek love under covers!"
674,Emotion,LovePoemsLoveStoryBrotherlyLovePoembylouisrams,"he offered her all the treasures that she desired
if only she could put out his fire.
the fire that was in his soul
was starting to burn out of control.
but! of him she did not want any part
for she was in love with another
and this man was his brother.
his love so deep, and so profound
he let out a scream, without a sound.
seeing the way she looked at his brother
he knew then, that there would be no other.
his love for both, was so strong
that he knew, together they belonged.
so with his heart in his hand
he decided to make a plan,
to show them that they belonged together
and through marriage, their life
would be better.
now they both knew, that his
heart was broken
but! another word was never spoken.
he had shown them that his love
was strong enough, to endure the pain.
and that their love, should be the same.
unknowingly this was part of GODS plan
to see the love that he had within
given up for love of his brother.
the LORD already had a new love, on her way
and forever in his heart she would stay.
so on his brothers wedding day
a beautiful woman passed his way.
eyes so deep, hair so black
he almost caught a panic attack.
and as their eyes met, and their
hearts slowed down its pace.
he knew that it was the end of the race.
for now they both had the love they desired
and she would be the one
to put out his fire."

Love is like a painting
filled with all colours and shades
love is like a bleeding heart
cut with many sharp blades
love is like a never ending story

love is like a space everlasting

love is like the circle of eternity
always there to take for free

Love is an open clear pool
where no hate can dare swim
love is a captured sunset

Upper the earth
And under the sky
For any thing with
EVERY thing for love love love
Making each one with love
Love love love...!"
681,Emotion,LovePoemsLoveWhatIsLovePoembyRobertLouisStevenson,"LOVE - what is love?  A great and aching heart;
Wrung hands; and silence; and a long despair.
Life - what is life?  Upon a moorland bare
To see love coming and see love depart."
682,Emotion,LovePoemsslowTheLoveNeverLoveAStrangerPoembySadiqullahKhan,"The side glances of the lover
From the east from the mountains
From the deserts from the wild
Looks to the moon and counts stars
Talks to himself sometime sings
Gets angry soon but loves like mad
Cries like rivers smiles like angel
What he wears what he not
So selfless and in his world lost
Who is he across the table
With candle lit I wait for him
Will he come and whisper sweet
I will show my earring to him
A band on arm a move of my hair
But he looks into my eyes
He is drawing my sketch
Shall not I see him once again
Never love a stranger for they
Make you weep for night and day

683,Emotion,LovePoemsa11LovePassionAWandererInLovePoembyRenuRakhejaakaTranquilOcean,"My heart is a wanderer in love
May it ever remain so
Roaming in the pathless land
In a caravan
Just going where the winds blow...
Sometimes rendered miserable
Blown in all directions
In search of my eternal love fable
Inspite of all defections
Always singing the song of love....
Longing for the moon
Searching in the dunes
Will only be still when it becomes crystal
That there is no breath left
For me to fulfill....."
684,Emotion,LovePoemsPuppyLoveOrRealLovePoembyKennethiaWhite,Am I falling for him or is htis just puppy love? Even though he's not mine I still get weak from his hugs. It's crazy how my parents say it's just puppy love but not this time around.What do I feel when i know im like a rebound? I want him to be the one but who really knows.....? I know he's good just like a pound of dro. So is it puppy love or is it real love? I may never know so this is the way i feel.....
685,Emotion,LovePoemsTheMeasureOfLoveSungToFromRussiaWithLovePoembyDenisMartindale,"The measure of love, in truth, is this:
To treasure each sigh, close by, then kiss!
I've revelled each girl I yearn,
Just to discern
The measure of love!
Soft embraces, gazes...
In search for one true friend...
Let go... then watching love grow...
Then lips pressed tight, just right,
As if our two hearts said, 'Hello! '
Love prays this is so...
The measure is true in gentlemen...
Right out of the blue! So who knows when?
It's meant to astound you, too...
So you can view
The measure of love!"
686,Emotion,LovePoemsLoveLoveLovePoembyAldoKraas,"Love, love, love!
Is very special
And so warm
Because it is

Out from our hearts
That we give
To the ones that
We love and cherished
The most in our lives"

689,Emotion,LovePoemsLoveLoveLoveLoveLoveWithoutADoubtPoembyDavidTaylor,"How do you write a poem
about Love?
It cannot be caught
and is beyond words’
power of depiction.
It has no place to be,
all places are filled
with Love.
Without Love would
anything have any savour?
Love is what joins
Love is what flows
Love is what counts
Love is what grows
Love is what’s known.
Love is all around
Love is all about
Love is all we ask
Love is all we give
Love is all I have.
Love wants nothing
Love needs nothing
Love misses nothing
Love excludes nothing
Love is what this is all about.
Joining, flowing, counting,
growing, knowing
around, about
asking, giving, having
All is Love,
of that I have no doubt."
690,Emotion,LovePoemsLoveAndLovePoembyPANOUSHAD,"Your eyes in my heart,
vast, deep, bluish,
a sweet breeze now touches
the brain, heart, mind and soul,
alluring lips
whisper in my ears again
the depth of your love
as the stars dappled stream flows
not disturbing anybody
reflecting its beauty ever,
wings of love, beauty and eternity
merge into one,
when? from where?
I don't know, sure,
I have got a bit of
soft spot for you and the apple of your eyes,
now, the ring on your little finger,
giggling bangles encircling the wrist,
light green vein on your soft hand
near the silver wrist watch,
swaying earrings stroking the cheek
appear more beautiful,
birds, flowers, butterflies,
life on the earth,
grass, galaxies, time and infinity,
my mind recollects all these...
Moses and Ten Commandments,
the Bible, the Qur'an, the Gita...
rationalists, communists, atheists...
Darwin, Freud, Newton,
Magellan, Copernicus, Shakespeare,
Van Gogh, Charles Chaplin,
E equals MC squared,
cloning, IT...
pianissimo, play on...
dreams...
an innocent smile
on the face of a child,
tears of a neglected old mother,
a rose lying near the tomb in silence
with scattered tears on the petals,
sleep, death, darkness...
why did I come here?
who sent me here?
where am I going after death?
there is life beyond the grave?
for whom do I wake up in the morning?
why the creations are in pairs: male and female?
why does nature bind me with your eyes?
why does nature allow your eyes
to pierce me so deep?
two doves ruffle their feathers
on the branches near the green leaves,
the sky kisses the ocean
making ripples and waves on its breast,
electrons keep their smartness
near the protons,
day and night play hide and seek,
Tajmahal blazes in the evening rays
pulsating the loveever...
the stars wink at each other
during theirtravel in the space,
moonlight touches the petals of lotus
in romance,
now the pregnant clouds pour,
the flowers and fruits delight the soul,
now, no prejudices,
no narrow domestic walls,
but love
your eyes
vast, deep, bluish..."
691,Emotion,LovePoemsWhyILoveYouLoveLoveLoveLoveLoveLoveLovePoembyUdiahwitnesstoYah,"You give to me hope
And help me to cope
When life pulls me down
You bring me around
You teach me to care
And help me to share
You make me honest
With kindness the best
From you I learned love
With grace from above
It's for you I live
And I want to give
You are the reason
That fills each season
When I hear love I think of you
You are my world and best friend too
I love you because you are so kind, thoughtful and caring
I love you because you are so pleasant, lovely and sharing
You made me the man I am

don't rip a hole in my chest

694,Emotion,LovePoems0004LoveAndLawLawAndLovePoembyMichaelShepherd,"Law of love?  Sounds good… so, tell me more…
Love of law?  mmm…maybe…not so sure…
You can disregard the ancients –
label them  Not Applicable – bin that bulky file…
or try to make some sense; and they insist
that love and law are so close intertwined
that together, they may tell
more than each other taken individually.
What might this mean? Where can we start?
Those ancients say that all this universe,
all this creation, is one single act of love;
love brings it forth, sustains it, nourishes it,
and so ultimately, it merges into love;
and by the laws of love,
which hold all forms by law,
our natural state is naught but love;
and knowing this, knows no injustice in ourself;
knows all as equal; knows no pressures nor compulsions;
knows no darkness; and no partiality or preferentiality;
and partaking of this universal love,
we’re therefore just, and light of heart,
and ready of response..
and so, this love, which knows ourself as love,
(for every creature's nature is pure love)
may love the laws which make our nature thus;
love the laws of love, and live as love;
so out of love, comes law;
and out of law, comes love.
only in this fleeting moment of the present
is our life lived;
and only if, in this continuous now,
love and law are present in each action,
may we make our golden future;
live a golden life, where law has made us free.
this, the ancients say; the proof is ours to live."
695,Emotion,LovePoemsIfLoveWereLikeWaterBestLovePoemsPoembyCharlesWiles,"If love were like water
I'd build you a fountain,
And if love were like stone

But as these are not love
I'll just give you me.

700,Emotion,HatePoemsThePowersOfHatePoembyVegaDestinyStar,"Hate is the opposite of love.
These emotions are powerful.
Hate stirs up conflicts and wars.
Discrimination is a cause of hate.
People say hate is a powerful word.
It is indeed a powerful word hate.
Hate brings on Anxiety
Anxiety leads to fear.
Fear brings on anger.
Anger leads to suffering.
Suffering causes death.
This feeling is dark and dreadful.
Hate is represented by the color black.
Such a dark deep color like hate.
In the dictionary there are too many words that mean hate.
Does all Humanity hate each other.
People hate you for your beliefs, interests, dress, even the way you look.
Thinking that hate will be a solved problem is only a madman's dream."

But your always on my mind
I hate the way you  smile
As beautiful as it may be
I hate the way you walk
And I hate the way you talk
I hate the way you smell
And I hate the way you feel
I hate the way you hair shines
And waves in the breeze
But most of all I hate the way
You make me feel
How your always on my mine
The way I see you but your never there
I hate it when I look at another girl
And all I see is you
I especially hate how much I love you
And everything you do
I hate how I can never have you
Or how my heart is not breaking over you
But shattering inside
With each piece of my heart
Contains a tiny fragment of memories I’ve confined
Memories of you I’ve held deep in side
Never letting go
I hate the way I feel when I miss you
And I want to break down and cry
I hate the pain that’s burning inside
w/t thoughts of how much I love you
that I could never hide
I hate, it and I hate you
But know matter how much I say it
I’ll still always love you deep down in side"

For trusting you
Hate me
For not thinking of you

Hate me
For the pain I caused you"
704,Emotion,HatePoemsIHatePoembyJessFry,"I hate the way you look at me,
And the way you stand and stare,
I hate how you have a lame excuse,
For almost never being there.
I hate it when you always drink,
And always raise your voice,
I hate it most when you call me her,
You’re leaving me no choice.
I hate it when you turn your back,
And mumble ‘not tonight’
I hate it when you go away,
And then turn your mobile off all night.
I hate it when you sometimes lie,
And keep your secrets deep,
I hate it when you don’t want sex,
Or lie away from me to sleep.
I hate the way you make me feel,
When fit girls give you attention,
I hate the fact my love is real,
And the way you snub my affection.
I hate it when you get me mad,
And when you make me cry,
I hate it when I wake up sad,
Those days I just want to die.
I hate it when you make me laugh,
And the way you read my mind,
I hate that annoying music you play,
And the way you’re always kind.
I hate the fact I don’t hate you,
And how I never will,
Its just you piss me off,
You make me want to kill.
I hate it that you’re good in bed,
When you feel the need,
I hate it when you’re in my head,
And make my thoughts seem easy to read.
I hate the fact I love you,
And how you’re some what right,
I hate it that I’ll always love you,
Forever from morning to night."

I run from myself

But all I know is
I have to run

Just kill yourself

707,Emotion,HatePoemsALoveToHatePoembyLawrenceSPertillar,"Is it getting clearer...
For those who fear to be themselves.
They who have entertained disrespect,
To the point where none is left.
Inspected in depth...
Or quests requested!
Blinded they are like fools on crack!
Using tools of fools to keep themselves back.
Blinded they are like fools on crack.
Or a black cat who can't stop giving 'bad' vibes,
An image to attack!
Blinded they are like fools on crack!
Seeking a shoulder to cry on...
And a pat on their backs!
Blinded they are like fools on crack.
Trying in doped slickness,
But losing themselves...
With weakened backbones attacked!
Is it getting clearer...
For those who fear to be themselves.
With a fear that endears them,
With a love to hate!
Berating unappreciated wisdom at stake!"

Because I hate its taste
And I hate to think about it
If I have the day I hate rice
Then you'll know that I don't feel well
I'm bored of this procession
I want to run from this life
Because I begin to hate myself
...just a little while
And everything will be back to normal again
That's the meaning of
The day I hate rice"
709,Emotion,HatePoems0226SelfHateSelfLovePoembyMichaelShepherd,"When did you cease to love, then hate, yourself?
What terrible event? How long ago?
What slight misunderstanding, view of self,
that led to fading love, then bitter hate?
What silent judgment of yourself, believed,
without a witness, umpire, counsel, friend?
Where was that childhood friend you loved, called 'God',
who knew you better than you knew yourself,
and understood your every thought and act?
What black and vicious weed grew secretly
while all your thoughts - you thought - were of the Good?
What demon whispered sweet and viciously?
Alas, no clue as yet. The only way,
to love that self that never went away."
710,Emotion,HatePoemsIHateMyselfPoembyElizabethCastleberry,"I hate that you fooled me
With your infectios smile

When you were lying all the while
I hate that you were so jealous
When he was just a friend
I hate that you turned this
Into something we cannot mend
I hate that we screwed this up
Past the point of no return
I hate that you never believed me
Trust is something you should learn
I hate that you ignore me now
As if we never were
I hate that you betrayed me
For my pain there is no cure
I hate that you broke my heart
You don't know what I've been through
But most of all
I hate myself for letting you"

Anger, pain
Disgust
I may have your looks
But I am not you

Why you ask
Because I

715,Emotion,HatePoemsDearJohnIHatePaperCutsPoembyAmberleeCarter,"I am writing this alive and with a fever,
'cause I needs to sweat out the virus
and breathe calmly without choking, for once.
I am writing this and hoping that its meaning,
my meaning, THE meaning
will mean something to you now.
That's why all poets and madmen
scrape together enough bitterness
to address their anti-love-letters to ' you'-
as though the reader, any random lover,
is the one intended to be pinpointed, blacklisted  then destroyed.
You know them, the ones always crying,
asking for spare sense to make change...
' I didn't see this coming'
It's so sad how some people
are just innocent bystanders
reading the morning newspaper-
when they just happen to look up to see
reality smacking them upside the head.
'you've got the wrong man'
only because they right man's dead.
So, I won't say I love you 'cause
those words mean more than something now-
and I won't say I miss you 'cause
it gets lost in translation.
But if I know you like I think I knew you,
you'll be reading between the lines right about now,
sipping your morning coffee and thinking
of something far more important than the sound of my voice.
But I know you'll read this 'cause
there are a million other fish in the sea
and everyone of them are titled ' you'
and they act and look just like 'you'
I hope you don't mind
I can't quite bring myself to address this to your name."
716,Emotion,HatePoemsAHateToHatePoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"Reality and not the dreams
It has to be like sun beams
To work for it like a team
It will come out like music with theme
There is no use to pass on the blame
It is reality and not the game
It has some reasons to materialize
You must have enough reasons to realize
Go deep and think over
Don’t find excuses or cover
You may find the answer
It may be felt only by fewer
Don’t loose hope and courage
You have to try hard and manage
You may be capable in your young age
Try to control it without resorting to rage
Infuse it with real colors of life
The world may be war torn and full with strife
You may have to walk on the edge of knife
Share the secrets with you lovely wife
Carry it on with so much of joy
Life as it stands for enough to enjoy
It may be contentment that is not to be rushed
Rest all are illusions not to be counted and pushed"

A naked starveling ever may'st thou be.
Poor rogue, go pawn thy fascia and thy bow
For some few rags wherewith to cover thee.
Or, if thou'lt not, thy archery forbear,
To some base rustic do thyself prefer,
And when corn's sown or grown into the ear,
Practise thy quiver and turn crow-keeper.
Or, being blind, as fittest for the trade,
Go hire thyself some bungling harper's boy;
They that are blind are often minstrels made;
So may'st thou live, to thy fair mother's joy,
That whilst with Mars she holdeth her old way,
Thou, her blind son, may'st sit by them and play."

who i refuse is also you...
never to be my beloved...
the first whom taught me a love is you...
the first whom taught me a yearning is you...
the first whom taught me a craziness is you...
and you also the first whom taught me a death from over wait..
never to be my friend...
because of you, i discovered a lands` love...
because of you, i rebuild my dreams...
because of you, i recovered my days again...
and because of you, i raised my white flag,
and declared my giving up...
never to be my beloved nor my friend...
i refuse to be your fire...
and you to be my blaze too..."
721,Emotion,HatePoemsAGirlNamedHatePoembyChristalCarpenter,"a girl named hate
stood at heavens gate
just wishing to be let in
she breathed out sin
and they shuned her
her pain a blur
she walked away
to try again another day
a girl named hate
stood at hells gate
she breathed out sin
and they let her in
they did not judge her
they loved her for sure
and there she will stay
day after day
that girl named hate
broke away from fate
she stayed were she fit in
she stayed with her sin
they did not hate her
they befriended her
things usualy turn out that way
when you tell some one to go away"

these words from me
I Love You forever
and please forgive me

723,Emotion,HatePoemsIHateSlutsPoembyChrissySimmons,"Down my street and through the city lives a little slut that I really pity
She lies and  steals and is whore to the heart
And all day long her legs are apart
She has no ambition and no self respect
I really do think she needs to be decked
I hate I hate this person so much
She should be imprisoned on a island in a small little hutch
I have sat and thought on what I could do
But all she thinks of is the next guy to screw
The world is now filled with herpes and aids
I hope she is happy for the trouble she’s made"
724,Emotion,HatePoemsILoveKurtCobainAndHateTobyKeithPoembyUriahHamilton,"I was walking through
Sunlit and lonely Melvindale,
Which for all intents and purposes
Is mystical Detroit,
And I was thinking about Susan,
Somewhere sad in Pennsylvania.
Boys were playing football,
Which made me lonesome
For Scott and Leroy,
Childhood companions
Lost in time!
A tall mother watering the lawn
Was goddess-like.
Does anyone love Li Po?
Where is Han Shan?
I’d kiss Susan beneath a Maple Tree
If she’d let me read to her
Mexico City Blues by Jack Kerouac."
725,Emotion,HatePoemsLoveAndHatePoembyAlexisBrown,"Love and Hate are four letter
words that tells lies and that

Love and Hate are four letter
words that express feelings

Love and Hate are four letter

Love and Hate are four letter
words that can be doubtful
Hate, hate is a four letter
word that is cruel and mean
Hate is a four letter word
that was made to hurt
someone's feelings
Hate is four letter word
that someone uses when they
are angry
Hate is a four letter
word that can tear your family apart
Hate is a four letter word
that can even break your heart
Love, love is four letter word
that can sneak up on us sometimes
Love is four letter word
that is hard to say at times
Love is a four letter word
that can be true and pure
Love is four letter word
that can be fake and cruel
Why do people say 'I love you'
and don't even know what
love is?
Love is a four letter word
that confuses the mind
of adults and us young
kids
Love is a four letter word
that can be blind
Love is a four letter word
that can play tricks on
our minds
Love and Hate are four
letter words that tells lies
and that tells the truth
Love and Hate are four
letter words that expresses
feelings for the old and the youth"
726,Emotion,HatePoemsDontEnvyDontHatePoembyCourtneyKane,".................Of this I know
as sky triumphs over rain,
the central theme in man,
of this I know
this feeling eats one alive,
leaves one without gut,
without eyes,
without name.
Indulge in it not
lest you are left half-eaten
in man's time, and God's eye.
Your poems are vapidity,
thin as steam
and without the substance
of the most fleeting thought;
your poems are nothingness,
as anger is nothingness.
Envy is poison.
What happens to
the color green
in other segments,
in other forms?
There is a repulsiveness,
there is a strange pain,
to kill, to kill,
to grow spite
like spite is its own
gnarled tree of life;
evil green eyes
come to no special place,
no awareness now.
If the earth gives in, soil and flesh,
evil green eyes have buried themselves, again."
727,Emotion,HatePoemsIHateTheThoughtOfHateCrimesPoembyJoeRosochacki,"A crime is a crime no matter how you cut it,
A murder is a murder, a rape is a rape,
An assault is what it is,
A crime scene is a crime with the yellow tape.
If the prisons were to be abundant,
We can then send to jail all are convicted,
We don't have to pardon anyone out overcrowding and time off for good behavior,
We must send all the criminals that indicted,
Guilty as charged that is what should fuel our endeavor.
Are we really up to the cost?
Are we really up to taxation?
Are we saying we have lost?
Are we saying we'll pass another law,
such as hate crimes,
without a suitable explanation?

728,Emotion,HatePoemsIBeganToHatePoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"I was born a righteous man
Just like you, I'm a loving man
When you stole my land from me
I began to hate
I began to hate
I began to hate you and your children
I began to hate you and your friends
I began to hate with a passion
Maybe I am simply old fashioned
I feed my kids multiple hate pills
Then send them down the road to kill
This is the  message I want to instil
Hate
Hate without debate
Hate, Hate, Hate
Hate like the darkness
That resents the day
In the land you took away my wealth
Along with my loss went my health
How can a man learn to love and forgive
When you have not returned
What you were never meant to receive
So I began to hate
I began to hate
I began to hate you and your children
I began to hate you and your friends
My children are taught to hate
Obey questions without debate
With their last breathe they dedicate
A moment of hate

The pain and heartache i put you through

I took everything good and turned it bad
I hate myself for hurting you
Your pain i wish i could undo
In the end all we did was shout
I chewed you up and spat you out

I'm sorry for not giving you the best of me
I'm sorry things aren't how they used to be
I hate myself for hurting you

These things i simply can't deny

But i'm so so sorry for hurting you"

Hate is not the answer to everything
Don’t burn your neighbor’s house down
Just because she comes from the Middle East
She is just the same as you
Don’t bring bombs to Afghanistan or Iraq
Bring flowers and love
Because we were created equal not to be looked as alien
We might come from different cultures or different places
It doesn't matter! ! !
We all are humans
We all have 2 hands 2 feet 10 fingers in all
Although we all may be different looking
We are all from the same race

731,Emotion,HatePoemsHatePoembyRobertWilliamService,"I had a bitter enemy,
His heart to hate he gave,
And when I died he swore that he
Would dance upon my grave;
That he would leap and laugh because
A livid corpse was I,
And that's the reason why I was
In no great haste to die.
And then - such is the quirk of fate,
One day with joy I read,
Despite his vitalizing hate
My enemy was dead.
Maybe the poison in his heart
Had helped to haste his doom:
He was not spared till I depart
To spit upon my tomb.
The other day I chanced to go
To where he lies alone.
'Tis easy to forgive a foe
When he is dead and gone. . . .
Poor devil! Now his day is done,
(Though bright it was and brave,)
Yet I am happy there is none
To dance upon my grave."

Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving,
O, but with mine, compare thou thine own state,
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving,
Or if it do, not from those lips of thine
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments
And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,
Robbed others' beds' revenues of their rents.
Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov'st those
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee.
Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.
If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,
By self-example mayst thou be denied!"

So twist through time,
If you ever look back...
Admit you used me like the other damn Jacks!
So all that time you were lying?
All that time I was a fool?
Now this time I lay dying,
Drowning in this apathy pool,
These salted tears the gullable shed,
Well I've shed mine,
With guilt and dread,
Hear the voices,
Conscience in my head,
Now I can't trust it,
My conscience's dead.
Bittersweet, bitterweet tears run down,
All that time, I choked, I drowned,
I bled these thoughts again and again,
In my mind again, and again..."

Know that if you walked away,
i will never love another..
Even if i killed my own heart,
and stopped it from it's right to beat.
I swear i'll tare it apart,
if it longed to who is used to cheat.
How have i ever fell for you?
in no time you had all of me.
How didn't i know what's true?
that you never felt for me.
And i saw more than a sign,
but yet i stayed so in love.
Thinking that you are mine,
i flew all the skies above.
And they told me but i didn't believe,
it will end soon for it had no start.
But i heard nothing, trying to achieve,
the dream of my life to reach your heart.
What was ever on my mind?
if people lied to me, will so my eyes?
How was i so blind?
and hiding from all those lies.
I guess that no words are enough,
to describe the pain inside me.
I thought i am your only love,
and i'm your star and reverie.
Can't help but to stare at you,
and stare back at my weary life.
Can't help but to hate you,
and in this gale i won't survife.

i can't believe i was never strong.."

he sits on his bed and thinks of what he’s gonna say—
half a case of beer bottles scattered around in diligent dismay.
he’s not a coward.
he’s just lonely.
so much pain runs through his veins;
the scars on his wrists prove his humility
for when he lost his lover, the life he’d built, and part of his family.
confident in his wits—
he picks up the phone and dials the digits;
reciting them by heart he’s feeling inspired, clever, and wise—
regretfully remembering how he’s always had them memorized.
he's mad to love
she's mad to hate.
he wants to create
she wants to annihilate.
she’s not lonely.
she’s just a coward.
so much fear runs through her veins;
the scars on her wrists prove her vanity
for when she turned in her life ungratefully.
laying back-down on her bed—
she’s thinking of all the better men she’s scored;
her phone rings and she’s caught in her deplore.
he pours his heart out before he can think:
racing thoughts dipped in mental ink.
he whispers words reserved for a lovers’ dance
and begs her to give him half-a-fucking-chance;
for he believes he’s only half-the-man now—
despite the newly dug furrows in his brow.
I must be crazed to deny him;
no girl in her sane mind would let this tension unwind.
unraveling like a mummy from the grave—
he lets honesty and candor flood the airwaves.
you see it’s been a year since they've talked;
she said she’d already accepted that he’d pass her by.
she doesn’t believe in come-back-around’s:
you’ve got one shot with one person till you’re dead in the ground.
he’s exhausted now—
the last of the beer syllables have endowed.
every emotion displayed on his face
he feels worn in the way you feel after running a 3 mi race.
she’s on the other end wishing he’d begin again—
but of arrogance or defense—
instead she responds,
“I don’t want to be responsible for your depression;
I have enough on my chest by way of confession.”
she feels like hell
he feels like heaven
cause he knows he’s a creator
and she’s a destroyer.
he's mad to love
she's mad to hate.

739,Emotion,HatePoemsPoemHateIsOnlyOneOfManyResponsesPoembyFrankOHara,"Hate is only one of many responses
true, hurt and hate go hand in hand
but why be afraid of hate, it is only there
think of filth, is it really awesome
neither is hate
don't be shy of unkindness, either
it's cleansing and allows you to be direct
like an arrow that feels something
out and out meanness, too, lets love breathe
you don't have to fight off getting in too deep
you can always get out if you're not too scared
an ounce of prevention's
enough to poison the heart
don't think of others
until you have thought of yourself, are true
all of these things, if you feel them
will be graced by a certain reluctance
and turn into gold
if felt by me, will be smilingly deflected
by your mysterious concern"

Breeze that’s cool is but ephemeral;
Sultry nights embrace you so tight,
Blinding you in the magic shards of light.
Hell is the summer’s day,
With the sun’s burning ray;
It destroys thy once magnificent lea,
And turns to mud the beatific sea.

Depressed
Thinking about suicide
Not just sometimes
But all the time
I write these words in digust
Upon my mirror
In my own blood
Glaring back at me
I hate myself and I wanna die
Pent up emotions
Ripping me apart
Inside my head is a endless chant
Bugging and never ending
Urging me to just go ahead and give up
Today, tomorrow, and yesterday
Always it's the same
I can't stop it
Not even sure that I want to
All I know for sure is
I hate myself and I wanna die
So many times
I've thought about it
Even come close to carrying my threat through
Cos it seems to me to be
Sad but true
No one here on this earth really gives a damm about me
Pitiful ugly me
The stuff nightmares must surely be made of
Bringing my funeral date a little bit closer still
I write these words that keep on breaking my heart
Over and over and over again
I hate myself and I wanna die
No one's fault but my own
I know that
I accept that
Just not strong enough to handle this life on my own
So soon
Very, very soon
I promise that I will make my final exit
Silently and without a word
So that I don't disturb any of your happy lifes
I'll whisper it to myself one last time before I go
What I would like you to crave on my tombstone when I'm finally gone at last
Please don't be too sad
Cos it's ok
Really it is
Cos the truth is
It was her choice
She hated herself and she wanted to die......"

755,Emotion,HatePoemsHateMatePoembyHerbertNehrlich,"There once was a little swine
he was partial to blueberry wine
and he had a fat mother
who had smothered his father
someone said you are out of line.
And the mother was really huge
and she dreamed of an oily deluge
where she would lose it all
and become a sweet doll
but the God of all fat was a scrooge.
So she went on a rampage to stab
all those thin ones who did not have flab
but she was so inept
that she finally wept
and she hoped for the gift of the gab.
But the weather had turned rather sour
it was raining from shower to shower
so she called to the crowd
that today is allowed
real fighting in mud, woman power.
But the  people  who'd smelled her objected
she was fat, had completely neglected
her old body at that
and she was rather fat
so she found that they all had defected.
When the stars came out shining  in gold
and this fatso had done what she's told
she just jumped from the castle
to avoid  further hassle
she had always seen others as old.
What this proves is the subject of hate
is so futile to use on a mate
if you hate you are dumb
they should flog your old bum
but I think that we may be too late."

if the answer is in yes, then there lies
the solution for all tragedies
we have the medicine and remedy
Why go outside and advocate?
take the refuge under the guise of lies and relate
the things which are common
for all of us as human beings
Whoever has won over the hatred
happiness has always led
the humanity to the purposeful end
we have respected and bowed to such trend
hate emanates fromthe greed and selfishness
the lines can be traced on the face
the visible displeasure is easily noticed
its repercussions are easily felt but roots not traced
we burn with the rage
write it down on the page
but again return to an old theme
and follow them

757,Emotion,HatePoemsTheHateThatIHatePoembyAdalieHettie,"I hate the hate that resides in me now
I hate the hate that is so heavy it weighs me down
I hate the hate that keeps my emotions tightly wound
I hate the hate that charges my wall
I hate the hate that lies to strengthen my fall
I hate the hate that has me in chains
I hate the hate that courses through my veins
I hate the hate that is a shadow at my side
I hate the hate that has stolen my mind
I hate the hate that blinds me from the stars
I hate the hate that has created my war
I hate the hate that has stolen my grace
My scarlet letter written all over my face"
758,Emotion,HatePoemsIHateYouHatePoembyDICKSONMSETI,"my tears are flowing like a rain,
when am trying to catch that love train,
my feet fails to move as they feel pain,
through the bad memories existing in my brain.
I remember my life's suffering,
when he took me for granted, i was crying,
A nobody, useless it's hurting
some times it's a crime memorizing.
Testing his knife on my body! it happened,
even the donkey felt sorry for me, my cat cried,
my voice of pain was like a guitar tuned.
I can't believe today am  somebody.
his photocopy standing over me, needs help,
i feel sorry  for her but i can't stop,
she's beautifully on making a step,
but the memories i have i can't help."
759,Emotion,HatePoemsIHateDiplomacyPoembyCristinaGeanta,"I hate diplomacy
Hands are of no use tying,
The heart will find a way to win.
To hurt me
Tie my heart...
Tight enough for my hands not to be able to move.
Tie my heart and I'll be helpless...
Threaten me with pain...
I will hate you
And hurt more than the pain you could have brought me
For never wanting you to win
For not daring to lose...
I'll stay numb
And hate me for it...
But have my way later! ..."
760,Emotion,HatePoemsLetSuchPureHateStillUnderpropPoembyHenryDavidThoreau,"Let such pure hate still underprop
Our love, that we may be
Each other's conscience,
And have our sympathy
Mainly from thence.
We'll one another treat like gods,
And all the faith we have
In virtue and in truth, bestow
On either, and suspicion leave
To gods below.
Two solitary stars--
Unmeasured systems far
Between us roll;
But by our conscious light we are
Determined to one pole.
What need confound the sphere?--
Love can afford to wait;
For it no hour's too late
That witnesseth one duty's end,
Or to another doth beginning lend.
It will subserve no use,
More than the tints of flowers;
Only the independent guest
Frequents its bowers,
Inherits its bequest.
No speech, though kind, has it;
But kinder silence doles
Unto its mates;
By night consoles,
By day congratulates.
What saith the tongue to tongue?
What hearest ear of ear?
By the decrees of fate
From year to year,
Does it communicate.
Pathless the gulf of feeling yawns;
No trivial bridge of words,
Or arch of boldest span,
Can leap the moat that girds
The sincere man.
No show of bolts and bars
Can keep the foeman out,
Or 'scape his secret mine,
Who entered with the doubt
That drew the line.
No warder at the gate
Can let the friendly in;
But, like the sun, o'er all
He will the castle win,
And shine along the wall.
There's nothing in the world I know
That can escape from love,
For every depth it goes below,
And every height above.
It waits, as waits the sky,
Until the clouds go by,
Yet shines serenely on
With an eternal day,
Alike when they are gone,
And when they stay.
Implacable is Love--
Foes may be bought or teased
From their hostile intent,
But he goes unappeased
Who is on kindness bent."
761,Emotion,HatePoemsHatePoembyStayoutofmylife,"I hate myself for this
I hate this person I've become
I hate who I am and who I thought I would never be
I hate my father for making me this way
I hate the selfishness I have now become
I hate the endless pain I put people through
I hate the way I hide myself in this pain
I hate the crazy world Im living in called my life
I hate when my friends suffer because of my problems
I hate the fact that everything I've worked
so hard not to be is what defines me
I hate that people cant see who I really am
I hate that my heart is broken with no one to put it back together"
762,Emotion,HatePoemsIHateThatIDonTHateYouPoembyJordynHeal,"I hate that you left me
I have that I fell for you
I hate that your smile haunts
I hate that you died
I hate that I can't be angry
I hate that I'm upset
I hate that you wanted this
I hate that I wasn't enough
I hate that I couldn't make you happy
I hate that your gone
I hate that I don't hate you
I hate that your laugh is gone
I hate your gentle kisses
I hate your friends for not crying
I hate that I can't stop crying
I hate that life goes on
I hate that your not actually dead
I hate your choices
I hate the drugs that you love
I hate I feel that your dead
I hate you're no longer mine
I hate the people you now call friends
I hate the men you sleep with
I hate your dad for what he's done
I hate seeing you so unhappy
I hate so many things but the one
I hate the most
I hate that I love you
I hate I would die for you
I hate I'll never get over you
I hate this new you
I hate myself for not hating you"
763,Emotion,HatePoemsSonnet90ThenHateMeWhenThouWiltIfEverNowPoembyWilliamShakespeare,"Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;
Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
And do not drop in for an after-loss.
Ah, do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow,
Come in the rearward of a conquered woe;
Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,
To linger out a purposed overthrow.
If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
When other petty griefs have done their spite,
But in the onset come; so shall I taste
At first the very worst of fortune's might,
And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,
Compared with loss of thee will not seem so."

I hate that you left me stand stupid for so long
I hate that you thought I could or would take it.
I hate you
I hate that you let me go
I hate that you left me standing alone.
I hate you
I hate that you couldn't prove me wrong
I hate that I was right.
I hate you
I hate that I met you
I hate that I opened  my heart
I hate that it was to you
I hate that I love you
I hate you
I hate that I lost my clear mind
I hate that I lost my direction
I hate that I lost it because of you
I hate you
I hate that I hate you
It wasn't suppose to be like this.
I hate you."
766,Emotion,HatePoemsNormallyIHateSportsPoembyMichaelPhilips,"Don’t ask me how I am here
standing next to the pro quarterback
as he lofts one down the practice field.
There should be a vapor trail on that one
as it descends into the next county
with smart bomb accuracy
and almost makes you believe in sanctity,
or better yet, romance.
I’d forgotten how nothing else matters
in the moments after your first kiss.
I turn.
He’s over there looking at a clipboard."
767,Emotion,HatePoemsHatePoembySandraOsborne,"Somewhere, it must have happened first,
The fear, the anger,
The helpless feeling of guilt.
Somewhere, it must have happened first,
The sarcasm, the malice,
The wearied feeling of shame.
Somewhere, it must have happened first,
The desertion, the anarchy,
The drained feeling of alone.
Somewhere, it must have happened first,
The lost love, the lost faith,
The stoic feeling of the end
Somewhere, it must have happened first,
Somewhere, it must have."
768,Emotion,HatePoemsTheDestructionOfHateMurderTheBeastPoembyMelvinaGermain,"Brought up in a prejudice dysfunctional household.
Took away the heart that once lived within your soul
Fiery eyes of a demon, a  prejudice beast
Live your heart, conjuring up a deploring feast
You’ve hurt, you’ve maimed, took education away.
Took bright eyes and turned them a shade of gray.
Many years took  its toile on the likes of you.
Bad heart, failed kidneys, time to pay your dues.
You reside in a room on the other side of town.
No one visits, no one cares, you sit wearing a frown.
Time to think and reflect while your body breaks down
No legacy to leave, you failed all around
The same people you despised, harbored hate for years
are the people who now console, dry your tears.
Why waste your time in this blessed life,
to create heartache, hate and contribute to ones strife.
Remember what you give out, you get back ten times more.
Father time will surely visit, come walking through your door.
Pick yourself up, start now before it’s too late.
Stop the cruelty, the pain, the destruction of hate.
(April 13/2007)"
769,Emotion,HatePoemsTheFateOfHateIsHatePoembyDrRajendraTelaNirantar,"The fate of hate is hate
Hate was his way of life
Humanity he did not like
Killed thousands
Around the world
Taught others
To live in hate
In the name of religion
Called himself a human
Lived like a demon
Spread terror on the earth
Did not get
Two yards for himself
Remains buried
In the depth of the sea
Was cursed by everybody
From a child to elderly
His fate was known
Long before he died
Tried his best to hide
But could not survive
The fate of hate is hate
Hate killed hate

770,Emotion,HatePoemsHatersHateWithPassionPoembymayacrisol,"I started out expressing my thoughts...
pouring out my heart and soul
i never planned to look around
i just needed a pad to write my thoughts
but papers get thrown away and misplaced
this site was perfect...just perfect..it felt like home
i thought i could say anything i want
express my ideas without insulting others
refute, argue, agree accordingly
but to never never hate personally
the poser...why because it's not my place
to judge people i don't really know so well
I do rant when poked and provoked
but i don't go chasing the hater
just to dis him all over the board
making me ponder deeply now
I have so much hate inside they say
but never with such passion as they."
771,Emotion,HatePoemsDonTYouJustHateItPoembyLindaOri,"Don't you just hate it when you lose control?
You try so hard to keep your mouth shut
Then some idiot pushes you over the edge -
And your mouth runs away with you?
Don't you just hate it when you do your best
To be open and nonjudgemental
Then something snaps and the bitch comes out
And you end up looking like a fool?
I guess it's just human nature at fault
Am I really that shallow and crass?
But I tell you some days it's all I can do
Not to kick some dumb jerk in the ass!
Oh..................that felt good! ! ! !"
772,Emotion,HatePoemsIHateToFlyPoembytiylerdurden,"I hate to fly
And do you know why
You stand in huge line
For three hours
Just to have your bag
Checked in by a retarded old hag.
I hate sitting in the plane
It gives me pain
Next to a person who does
Not speak English
And a little terror kid
Who you wish would play
With the fire exit"
773,Emotion,HatePoemsIHatePoembymieshadevres,"I hate the way you act
I hate the way you dress

And your family to boot
But i still find myself falling in love with you."

hate that I can't trust

I hate,
hate who I've been.
I hate,
hate to make decisions.
I hate,
hate that I can't hate those I should.
I hate,
hate my life.
I hate,
hate that I can't die.
I hate,
hate to live in fear and hate.
I hate,
hate my uncertainty.
I hate,
hate the lies people tell me.
I hate,
hate that I believe.
I hate,
hate those that wish their lives were mine.
I hate,
hate all emotion that's mine.
I hate,
hate that I need others.
I hate,
hate my own d*mn incompetence.
I hate,
hate that there's so much to hate."
775,Emotion,HatePoemsHatePoembyJamesStephens,"My enemy came nigh,
And I
Stared fiercely in his face.
My lips went writhing back in a grimace,
And stern I watched him with a narrow eye.
Then, as I turned away, my enemy,
That bitter heart and savage, said to me:
""Some day, when this is past,
When all the arrows that we have are cast,
We may ask one another why we hate,
And fail to find a story to relate.
It may seem then to us a mystery
That we should hate each other.""
Thus said he,
And did not turn away,
Waiting to hear what I might have to say,
But I fled quickly, fearing had I stayed
I might have kissed him as I would a maid."
776,Emotion,HatePoemsIHateYouButILoveYouPoembyScarredUnknown,"I’m tearing in two
And I’m not sure what to do
My heart is screaming I love him
My mind saying I hate him
What do I do
I love him, but I hate him?
I love everything about him
I love how he smiles
I love how he can make me smile
I love how no matter what is going on.
I love how he will always be there
But all the same
I hate him
I hate everything he means for
I hate how he can make me smile
No matter how hard I try not to
I hate how he can make me cry
I hate how he can make me sad
I hate how he can make me feel
I hate how he looks at me with his eyes so kind
I hate how all of this makes me love him even more
I hate how I can’t hate him
Most of all I hate myself
I hate myself because
I can never hate you"
777,Emotion,HatePoemsHatePoembyLyndseyGrant,"I hate the way you make me cry
Tying knots around me
Forever binding me to this
Feeling of hollowness
I hate the way your screams
Echo inside me constantly blinding me
Deafening my sense of certainty
With your hurt
I hate it when glass shatters
Leaving pieces of my sanity splattered
On white carpets and Formica cabinets
And when the roof has caved in and crashes over my head
Crumbling down to my nail marred feet
I sweep it neatly up
And hide it darkened corners
With all the other forgotten martyrs
Left praying for the worlds sins
In a pool of crimson
I hate how you make me hate myself
Eroding and excavating my goodness
With your foolishness
False pride mixed with alcoholic breath
Triggering my gage reflexes with your familiar
Sour stench
I hate to love you
Every single vessel that allows you to be
Every tiny molecule
Atom and cell
That beats down on my shoulders
Like torrential rains suffocating normal functioning"
778,Emotion,HatePoemsALoveHateRelationshipPoembyvictoriamartinez,"It’s a love hate relationship
It’s been like this from the start
He lied to me, tricked my heart
Took my innocence and left me to have no choice
Took control of me his was the only voice
But, now I must sadly regret
He had lustful eyes the day we met
This is a love hate relationship
This is where its at
I want to lay down so bad
And if I don’t, he’ll push me onto my back
If I try to resist the house will echo a loud smack
He talks to me like I’m his property
He touched me like he paid the fee
And when we argue
He holds up his ring
Tries to explain what marriage means
It’s a love hate relationship
He tells me respect is what I lack
And if I laugh
It’ll be nothing but a blood bath
I’m not ashamed to admit I was wrong
And now the nights feel so long
It’s a love hate relationship
I hate to love him
And he loves to hate me
His hostile eyes full of rage
His anger builds up as he takes the stage
I go through what we had
I realize there is no reason to get mad
One day I’ll just get even
Hurt him till he’s on his knees pleading
Look at what we have
Common now this abuse is just sad
I let go
Yea, this is the end
A love hate relationship will now just be my past
Because that kind of relationship could never last"

It isn't fair
You never share
What is with you? ?
Do I need to hit you with my shoe?
That is covered with dog doo

You always said my hair was nappy
Don't you love me

Or, i'll make you out of clay
Don't delay

I am not your best friend

‘N I am sorry to break this to you
But …
I am not sure if I would ever be
Not that I don’t like you
But…
You are not my type
Or the other way around
So save your secrets to yourself
I don’t want to hear any, not even a bit
It disturbs me and haunts me
It also ruins my day each and every minute
I know someday you will read this
And hate me like some kind of disease
‘N instead of telling my secrets
I write them down in form of poems
‘N guess what? ? ?
I gain PEACE
‘N I got nothing to lose
So keep your secrets to yourself
No matter whose! ! !

784,Emotion,HatePoemsIHateYouDaddyPoembyDeborahAshdown,"I am so scared, finding it hard to breath,
my heart beats so fast, I want it to stop.
I can hear your footsteps nearing my door.
I cringe, bite my nails and sob into my pillow.
I can feel the stench of your breath on the side of my face.
Your touch feels like a bullet, sharp, hot and dangerous.
You enter inside me, sharply, with so much heat, penetrating too deep. You are a monster.
You whisper ' I love you '
I silently reply ' I hate you, daddy '
You don't hear my screams or see my tears, for if you did, you would put an end to my fears.
I lay there, my body a dead weight.
I take myself off to another land of beauty and love.
When you have finished your deadly sin, you smirk at me.
Your dark, evil eyes, you're the spawn of the devil.
As you leave my room of torture,
I turn over, begin to sob into my pillow,
Waiting for the pain and fears to return.
I know you will be back again, to-morrow!
I hate you daddy."

Pain and blood spills and does longly stay and linger.
To give my sliced append-aged digit a much needed bath...
I won't cook for a living, or go to school for typing or even take math.
Math and onions i do not like...
I'd rather have a tooth pulled or be super glued to a seat-less one peddled
down hill travelling brake-less bike.
I'll only eat onions that are totally cooked...I wont go to a restaurant and look on a menu to order it from the waitress, it will never be booked."
786,Emotion,HatePoemsHateLoveAndIPoembyOlinYeats,"Hate by my side,
Wagging his tail
And wanting to be worshiped.
Love by my side,
Walking with stealth
And wanting to be given.
Hate runs in front,
And points which way
Biting and clawing to have his will.
Love by my side,
Walking still so quietly
And wanting to be given.
We come to a traveler
-Hate, Love, and I-
Who is burdened and hurt.
Hate runs on
Love stands by his side
And I am-in the middle-trying to make my choice."
787,Emotion,HatePoemsIHateMyLifePoembyJustAnotherPoetGirl,"I hate my life and don't ask why
Cause you might think its just a lie
Everyone hates me, Everyone left me
I know that it sounds crazy
But its true, if you can see
Be what you can be
I feel invisible but no one cares
Loneliness is what i cant bare
Tears run down, my eyes start to sting
I'm running out of tears, but i Kept on Crying
No more tears, need to cry more
Blood replaced my tears, but spilling out more
My heart beats slower, my breathing becomes shallow
I fall on the ground, everything becomes blury
I can die right now since no one cares
Yes, that's what I should do
I close my eyes
I'll go to my dreamworld
My heart stops beating
My body stays still, my soul breaks and smiles no more."

So twist through time,

Admit you used me like the other damn Jacks!
So all that time you were lying?
All that time I was a fool?
Now this time I lay dying,
Drowning in this apathy pool,
These salted tears the gullable shed,
Well I've shed mine,
With guilt and dread,
Hear the voices,
Conscience in my head,
Now I can't trust it,

All that time, I choked, I drowned,
I bled these thoughts again and again,
In my mind again, and again..."
790,Emotion,HatePoemsITrulyDoHateTheNewsPoembyTheoremTheTruthSerum,"I truly do hate the news
It's full of half truths
And disposable heroes
It ruins the lives of many
The media swarms the story
If your the story
Then stay home and stay inside
Though from the media you cannot hide
They'll look over your fence
Or through your window
For that one snapshot
People say gunshot's kill a person
But so do snapshots
Once your famous
You can never live a normal life
It is cruel how we know more
About celebrities than we do of ourselves
How does reading garbage make us better
A man makes a profit
Off the magazine
Who is unfit to have that money
He ruins lives and me and you
He tells us how to look
And what we should be interested in
I truly do hate the news"

792,Emotion,HatePoemsHatePoembyVictorOsorio,"They say hate is another fear
A fear to not love
A fear to not belong
A fear to not be here
A fear that is wrong
I'm consumed with more than enough
I feel it all the time
More than the feeling of love
More than being afraid
Dark thoughts make me cold
Making it a part of me
Until I grow old
Until I can no longer see
I let the evil within
Take over my soul
By commiting this sin
I pay a greater toll
Slowly, now I'm fading
Blurry and freezy
It hurts to be hating."
793,Emotion,HatePoemsILoveYouAndIHateYouForItPoembyKayConlon,"I love you
And I hate you for it.
You made me fall in love with you
I’m not entirely sure why
You are cocky, and self-assured
You are vain, and temperamental
But I love you because of that
Not in spite of it.
I don’t need extravagance
Or anything to impress me
That job is already done.
I just want you.
And I hate you for it.
You show no pretence
Or false smiles
No airs or graces
And I hate you for it
Where is the line between love and hate?
I just want
YOU"
794,Emotion,HatePoemsHateAHatePoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"Just think of hate
Consciously relate
Try to valuate
And think of fate
It shall provide
And divide
Your opinion
For disunion
It burns you from within
Pushes to no more gain
It has restless background
Hat is seen and found
Such is impact
And it is very much fact
We lead hostile world
And invite miseries untold
Why not hate a ""hate""?
Why not greet and invite?
You will have sound sleep
That shall always have cheers to keep"

to the heavens above
to the earth below
to everyone around.
but even though you open your mouth,
no one hears a sound.
is it because they were born deaf to the world
or because they choose to be
someone who doesn't give a crap
about what happens to you or me.
i guess what i'm saying is that we need to act,
don't leave it up to fate,
because so many things can go wrong
that we cannot help but hate."

I hate that I can’t be around you.
I hate how I’ve lost you.
I hate how I’ve found out who you really are.
I hate that I can’t tell you any of this.
But most of all,
I hate how I can’t hate you,
Not even a little.
I hate how I still love you"
797,Emotion,HatePoemsHardLoveWhichIsHarderLoveOrHatePoembyChinaJones,"Hard is the love couples share as they try to reveal the love they share-
The words aren't there, hard to find, hard to seek. Love is hard and also blind when you try to hide,  and when you know its there.
Love is hard the up and downs, highs and lows, tares and snares
Hard to show and let them know the ones who know nothing about you
or the ones you can't stand are the ones who you should love
If you had show some form of love that one person you needed, was not
there now you are should've, could've, would've
because there was no love in your heart, hard love is the main thing of -
this world we live in
Love is hard in the place we call earth, Love isn't found not from
our indiviual peers, but from the citizens of America
Harder is love, hate comes easy
Is love hard because we don't know how or is love harder because
we don't care?
Love is blind- which is hard, hard to give, or hard to recieve
Which is harder Love or Hate?
I say love because we know its there but we simply ignore the presence of love, and hide in the darkness of the shadows of the issues of the world, only to hope on the light of LoVe."
798,Emotion,ThanksPoemsLetUsGiveThanksPoemPoembyDaveTanguay,"Our world of so many modern conveniences
We were born to accept, and have taken for granted
Allow us to live our lives with very little inconveniences
In our minds, a feeling of aid has been implanted
What would we do without television or telephone?
Not to mention a washer and dryer, along with
Running water
We were all born during such an historical milestone
With personal computers, our home - became our world
Headquarters
Let us give recognition, to the men and women - who
Persevered
The pioneers of yesterday, who gave us - what we have today
Through their hard work and tolerance, let their deeds be revered
Let us offer a moment of tribute, be gratefully given - in a highly
Valued way
Guided with persistence - by way of God’s resourceful hand
For he worked along beside them, as he whispered - his plan
Prayers - from those seeking to find a better way
Were being answered, -unfolding, before us were the wonder’s
Of a entirely newfound day"
799,Emotion,ThanksPoemsThanksForTheMemoryPoembyjimmyzepp,"Thanks for the memory,
For a man; golden history,
Lived a life full of misery,
A true man; soul of ivory,
A riddle; unsolved irony,
A hunter, an artist, a Dad,
Truly had given me all he had,
And me? Were I that bad?
Did I really made him sad?
No, he didn't curse me in his bed,
But had forgiven his wayward lad,
A talent, a poet a musician mad,
And he'll forever remember that,
His last wish; in all that he'd said...
Thanks for the memory; I really appreciate your sympathy...And this is for history..."

802,Emotion,ThanksPoemsMyThanksPoembyJohnGreenleafWhittier,"ACCOMPANYING MANUSCRIPTS PRESENTED TO A FRIEND.
'T is said that in the Holy Land
The angels of the place have blessed
The pilgrim's bed of desert sand,
Like Jacob's stone of rest.
That down the hush of Syrian skies
Some sweet-voiced saint at twilight sings
The song whose holy symphonies
Are beat by unseen wings;
Till starting from his sandy bed,
The wayworn wanderer looks to see
The halo of an angel's head
Shine through the tamarisk-tree.
So through the shadows of my way
Thy smile hath fallen soft and clear,
So at the weary close of day
Hath seemed thy voice of cheer.
That pilgrim pressing to his goal
May pause not for the vision's sake,
Yet all fair things within his soul
The thought of it shall wake:
The graceful palm-tree by the well,
Seen on the far horizon's rim;
The dark eyes of the fleet gazelle,
Bent timidly on him;
Each pictured saint, whose golden hair
Streams sunlike through the convent's gloom;
Pale shrines of martyrs young and fair,
And loving Mary's tomb;
And thus each tint or shade which falls,
From sunset cloud or waving tree,
Along my pilgrim path, recalls
The pleasant thought of thee.
Of one in sun and shade the same,
In weal and woe my steady friend,
Whatever by that holy name
The angels comprehend.
Not blind to faults and follies, thou
Hast never failed the good to see,
Nor judged by one unseemly bough
The upward-struggling tree.
These light leaves at thy feet I lay,--
Poor common thoughts on common things,
Which time is shaking, day by day,
Like feathers from his wings;
Chance shootings from a frail life-tree,
To nurturing care but little known,
Their good was partly learned of thee,
Their folly is my own.
That tree still clasps the kindly mould,
Its leaves still drink the twilight dew,
And weaving its pale green with gold,
Still shines the sunlight through.
There still the morning zephyrs play,
And there at times the spring bird sings,
And mossy trunk and fading spray
Are flowered with glossy wings.
Yet, even in genial sun and rain,
Root, branch, and leaflet fail and fade;
The wanderer on its lonely plain
Erelong shall miss its shade.
O friend beloved, whose curious skill
Keeps bright the last year's leaves and flowers,
With warm, glad, summer thoughts to fill
The cold, dark, winter hours
Pressed on thy heart, the leaves I bring
May well defy the wintry cold,
Until, in Heaven's eternal spring,
Life's fairer ones unfold."

804,Emotion,ThanksPoemsThanksPoembyCrystalJohnson,"This is for every girl that has gossiped about me.
This is for every boy that has ever broken my heart.
This is for all the friends that I thought I had, but in the end just turned out to be backstabbers.
This is for all the people that told me I couldn’t make it.
This is for anyone that has ever said I wasn’t good enough.
This is for all the ones that enjoyed kicking me while I was down.
This is for all the ones that pushed me behind just as I was getting ahead.
This is for all the people that have ever made me feel less than what I really was.
This is for all the kids that made fun of me because I was different.
This is for the ones that told me I was a failure, and made me believe it.
Because of you, I am the person that I want to be.
Because of you, I have learned to overcome all the insults that have been thrown at me.
You challenged me to fight for the kind of life that I wanted, not the kind of life you saw for me.
I am a much stronger person than I used to be.
I’m not that weak little girl that you used to know.
I’m not that little kid that wouldn’t mount to anything.
I am so much more than that.
Because of your judgment I have realized that nothing would hold me back.
You have done so much more than you think.
So, thanks.
This is to any person that has ever befriended me.
This is to every hand that has ever helped me when I was down.
This is for everyone that believed in me.
This is to all the people that gave me strength to follow my dreams.
This is for all the people who taught me to figure out who I am, and to accept the person I became.
This is for anyone who has ever said, “Good job! ” when I thought that I had ruined everything.
This is for all the people that stood behind me.
This is for all the ones that stood up for me.
This is to all the people that had hopes for me, even when I didn’t have any for myself.
This is for all the people that pushed me to go forward, even at times I wanted to stop completely.
Without you, I wouldn’t be who I am today.
Without you, I would still be the “nothing” that everyone thought I was.
Without you, I would still be that scared little girl, afraid to try anything new.
You made me realize how much I was really worth.
You made me realize that I wasn’t alone.
You made me realize that the world hadn’t turned it’s back on me,
I turned my back on the world.
Because of you, I am the person that I have always wanted to be.
Because of you, I like who I am.
Because of you, My entire life has changed for the better.
So, thanks."

807,Emotion,ThanksPoemsThanksMomPoembyLeslieAlexis,"I scavenged the thoughts,
Strained them from mind
Set them to the corner to take form
And I remembered...
I remembered falling down steps
And off trees:
Sometimes being pushed off,
Sometimes merely slipping,
All the same- falling.
I remembered falling a lot.
I remembered sitting in class
Trying to learn some maths
And feeling a touch
Like of a nursing child
Pulling on my shirt, exploring,
What hasn’t been seen before;
The hole from the nail in the door
When I had passed too close…
Yeah, I froze like a ghost.
Hoping not to be seen.
Shame placed me in the hole
And put me on the stage
And shined light in my eyes
And I was seen… me and my shirt.
I remember it well;
It was blue with dragons.
Aunt Vadlyn – my mother’s sister-
Bought it for me, two Easters past,
I wanted it to last,
So I kept it, though it was torn
And slightly over worn –
It was part of the handful I had.
I hated when mother would bring
What might seem, everything,
For everyone,
But her daughters and sons.
The neighbors got theirs.
The workers got theirs.
From the little we had,
I was always behind the fad.
My shirt kept me afloat,
But, the hole and the poke
Were much like,
A sea, the ocean at whole
Trying to get it;
I wanted to drown,
The dead has no shame.
The dead had no shame.
The next week
I wore my shirt again
In the regular order
And she didn’t poke,
No one saw the hole.
I didn’t remember
It even. All was good.
Now as a man,
With money of my own,
Though not plenty-
Enough to buy shirts-
I still wear those with holes,
But now without shame;
Thank you mama.

808,Emotion,ThanksPoemsForGeorgeWithThanksPoembyAlisonCassidy,"We played at the park that afternoon
She chased a football, wagging her tail
And barking at the local kids who
Laughed and called her 'sausage dog'
That evening she stumbled on the stairs
And whimpered when I picked her up
By midnight she was shivering with shock
The vet diagnosed herniated disc
Next day she was paralyzed and incontinent
The specialist was aloof and kept us waiting
Suggested surgery and wouldn't guarantee it
His fee was two thousand dollars.  We said no
The breeder said 'Give old George a ring'
George Schofield, chiropractor for dogs
Eighty-four years old.  Works from home
In an open fronted shed.  Charges ten dollars.
George Schofield, a nugget of a man
With stumpy fingers and heart of gold
Adjusted her spine and performed a miracle
In seven days, my dog was walking"

thanks for being hope in my despair
and mores, thanks for being there
when light walks away from the forest
along the long lonely snaking road
are cascading pike-peak  thorns
they hurt the foot at where none can care
all you can hear are crickets singing their dirges
when we call for ululation to heal the hurts
when the sun rises as it usually does,
and the cock crows at the hour it can;
when the apostolic minister rings the church bells
and the congregation begins to sing the 'martins',
hear it again, it's me saying once again, many thanks."

No matter what's happening you make me think I can do it.
These past few weeks have been hell on earth,
I needed you and you were there.
Every time I needed your help,
you were there for me.
Every time I needed a favor,
you did it without thinking twice.
Every time I need advice,
you gave me wisdom I never could have thought of.
Whenever I was down,
you cracked a joke and made me smile.
Whenever I felt totally confused,
you lit my way.
You were the ray of light through the dark,
the feeling of joy in the sorrow,
you were my lifeboat after the wreckage,
you gave me hope even in the bleakest of times.
Look what I'm trying to say,
Is thanks for everything.
I really can't describe it,
it's nice to have someone truly care.
If you ever need help, you know where I am.
If you ever need a favor, I'll be there.

and nothing give you peace,
just close your eyes,
and think of Him,
your worries will surely cease.
when you are tense and worried,
and think constantly bout the future
He who put you in this world,
will surely nourish and nurture.
when all seems to be going wrong
and youve lost the will to fight,
just lay yourself at his feet
and watch things become slowly right.
He's there for you in hard times,
but forget him not in good,
its He who gave you, all that you have
invisibly by your side He stood.
we look for Him everywhere,
when he's within us all the while,
you only have to ask an inch,
and He willingly gives a mile.
His love for you is boundless,
hes a friend for one and all,
when youve looked for happiness everywhere else
its time to heed His call.
wordly pleasures are momentary,
lasting joy is through His door,
just search within yourself, dear friend
He's right within your core.
Have faith, have hope
and do your best,
a good life will be your reward,
whatever you do, just remember
don't fail to say thanks to your God."
815,Emotion,ThanksPoemsBelatedThanksPoembyJosephAnderson,"He was not in to surface love,
Deemed it casual and for show;
But felt that deep within oneself
Was the place for love to grow.
Though he was never'born again',
In his faith he seemed secure.
His dealings with the trials of life,
Found him steady and sincere.
Work became his driving ethic;
Heavy, heavy was the load.
The path he walked along life's span,
Was a rough and and narrow road.
He faced life's problems straight-away
And he shunned hypocrisy;
He travelled the restrictive roads,
Of truth and fidelity.
So long ago he quit this life,
Leaving me alone and sad.
I try to follow on his course;
This is my thanks to you, Dad."

for one human lifetime,
chooses carefully the place to sit

where the stork’s cry echoes;
gathers his thoughts.
Out of mercy,
the breeze gently ruffles the surface
of the lake;

of the stillness of the lake,

reflecting the blueness of the sky;
reflects, beyond the blue,

fell one petal at a time,

I'll always remember who I should thank.
So thanks a lot, Mom.
When I'm running around being promiscuous,
Like you always thought I would become,
I'll always remember who I should thank.
So thanks a lot, Mom.
When I'm drinking myself to death,
Or when I'm lighting up my bong,
I'll always remember who I should thank.
So thanks a lot, Mom.
When I'm broke and on the street
Or when I'm writing a suicide note like a song,
I'll always remember who I should thank.
Yeah, thanks a lot, Mom."

Falling in love with love,
My heart was aglow.

And wedding bells rang.
Music played soft and low.
Romance is forever true.
And I am 'addicted' to
Loving you."

from the fullness of your bounty, enriching my heart and soul
brilliant yellow blossoms hanging heavily and bending every bough
like your arms reaching down to me from heaven above
the riot of colors that summer dresses every lowly corner
gladdens my  heart  and fills it with deep inexplicable joy of knowing your love
I see your presence mirrored in the deep green waters of the calm lake
and feel your loving touch as the breeze gently caresses me on a hot summery day
drenched am I in your love, as I run barefoot- carefree and gay
filled with the bliss of being alive and feeling the peace you'v gifted me overflowing from my heart
thank you dear Father for giving me life.. and pain enough to love every joy

Inks in my bossom with nectarous qoute;
Your marmalade of love flavors my heart;
Your luscious words blossom in my ardour's pot.
Your scarlet rose of cordiality,
Perfumes ev'ry morning of my day;
Heaven-scented juice from sapphire sky,
Showers my soul, blazes my very eyes,
Ev'ry time you wave your sweetest hi.
Your verdant pasture of solicitude,
Kissed by the xanthous sun of beatitude;
Emblazons my sight with ardency,
To see the pinnacle of heyday,
With a rainbow of celestial bliss,
Flamboyantly drawn on welkin's face.
Your candied grin of encouragement,
Became my character's ornament,
With blithesome colors from the firmanent,
Of burning tons of inspiration,
Fuels me to reach my aspirations,
Intensifies my motivation,
To touch the countenance of my ambition.
Thank you for the beauteous things you've taught,
For the barrels of sweetness you've brought;
Made me ready to face the world,
Fearless, confident, positive and bold,
To do the things they think I can't do,
To cease them from throwing their flaks of boo.
What I am now, I owe to you;
With all my heart, I thank you..."

841,Emotion,ThanksPoemsThanksForTheDisasterPoembyProfessorPoetryHound,"You know how when there’s a disaster where a bunch of
people are killed and the one guy who survives thanks God?
I think that’s a pretty screwed up perspective on the situation.
I know he’s happy to be alive, but if anything, he should be
cursing God for letting everyone else perish.
Now, why did God save this one guy’s sorry ass? Because the
guy went to church and prayed? I’m sure some of those folks
who perished did that too.
I know what you’re going to say – that it’s all part of God’s
mysterious plan. What an ignorant explanation that is!
And it’s not even an explanation.
I suppose Hitler was part of God’s plan too? And what about
Michael Bolton? Was it God’s plan to make that talentless hack
a superstar? Now that I think of it, maybe it was God himself
who went out and bought up all those CDs in order to
artificially run Bolton up the charts. If that’s the case, then it’s
true that God has a very mysterious plan. But at least he has a
sense of humor."

Her tail wagged like a metronome.
She raced the local kids around the oval.
They laughed and called her 'sausage dog'.
That night she stumbled on the stairs.
She whimpered when I tried to pick her up.
By midnight she was shivering with shock.
The vet suspected herniated discs.
Next day - incontinence and paraplegia.
The suited specialist duly kept us waiting.
Offered surgery (without a guarantee) .
Two thousand dollars?  You must be joking!
The breeder said 'Give old George a ring.
He'll soon have her on her feet again.
He treats them in an open fronted shed.
Calls himself a canine chiropractor.'
George Schofield - nearly eighty five years old -
A nugget of a man with heart of gold,
Placed his stumpy hands upon her spine.
In seven days, my little dog was fine.
This happened four years ago.  As far as I am aware, Old George is still manipulating dogs from all over Victoria.  He works every day from 10.00am till 4.00pm.  He has Tuesday's off.  He must be pushing 90 by now.  I'll never forget him."

Free ocean that seems
To rock, calm and soundless,

Half hers are the glancing
Creations that throng
With pageant and dancing
The ways of my song.

Are lit from her brand;
Men see them rekindle
Nor guess by whose hand.
Of thanks to requite her
No least thought is hers,--

Once, thanks in a verse."

When love is hard to find
Where cold nights reign with cupboards bare
Then God is on the mind
But who gives praise when life is grand
When God has seen us through
Who’ve learned in truth to understand
That God remembers too
How oft we fail to thank the Lord
For all His kindness done
Through love He’ll turn His vengeful sword
In Christ His faithful Son
Give thanks to God for large and small
Give thanks for life on earth
From deep within or not at all
Give praise for all you’re worth
Worthy is God of all our praise
For all His wondrous deeds
Who serve The Truth in all their ways
May find they have no needs
Yet still the nations live in stress
Where harvest brings defeat
They need to turn so God can bless
With food for all to eat
Yet those who have can ill afford
With belly’s full to sit
We need to pray through Christ our Lord
We need to do our bit
For things can change as times before
When God held back the rain
For who can tell if sin once more
Won’t change our times again"

870,Emotion,ThanksPoemsThanksParentsPoembyCandySimpson,"The moment you’re born, your parents promise you that they will always be there.
As you grow up, and reach maturity, you’ll realize that they say words but they don’t really care.
They tell you “we’ve been there, and done it, so don’t make the same mistake because we understand.”
But they don’t really know the reason why we tear, cry, and wipe off the tears with our hands.
Parents expect you to be who they want you to be, and soon enough they don’t listen to your voice.
They make all these promises to you, and now suddenly they broke and they are giving you no choice.
Parents talk to you about freedom and speaking out your mind, but when you’re expressing yourself, they block you out.
They say “I don’t want to hear because you’re too young to understand.” when really they are the ones who don’t know what they’re talking about.
I just want you to understand my heart and love me for me.
You can’t make me into someone that I don’t want to be.
You think that you get me, but the truth is that you don’t have a clue.
You say “you don’t know what you’re talking about” but in fact, I truly do.
I just want you to be happy for me, and see how much potential I really have in life.
Sometimes you make me so unhappy and you say you’re going to be there for me, but in fact you stab me behind my back with a knife.
Parents don’t really promise you anything, but I guess we pretend that they do.
So, they can help guide us in life and maybe we can learn to make a mistake or two.
You should be proud of me instead of judging me that some of the choices I made in life were wrong.
But, I don’t regret any of my experiences that I’ve endured because they made me emotionally strong."

in what was once the river bed.
Three years and more without rain.
Most of my livestock long since dead.
Yet still I have to struggle on
I have no choice no place to go
All of my men have packed and gone,
To where the deeper rivers flow.
Each evening I pray for rain
I won’t surrender to despair.
I’m not too old to start again.
No man can win who does not dare.
The storm clouds gather overhead.
Perhaps in answer to my prayer.
This time release much needed rain.
There’s water, water everywhere.
The river fills and overflows.
The arid earth drinks greedily.
The drought is over: Heaven knows
I’ve had my share of misery.
I face the future confident
That I can do what must be done
Determination and intent
are all I have I will go on.
I will build up my stock and then
I will employ some jackaroos.
To help me run the place again
much needed help that I can use.
But for the present work alone.
My nearest neighbour’s miles away
There is so much that must be done.
Enough to fill each working day.
When evening comes I will give thanks.
Unto my maker gratefully.
The river flows between its banks.
And all is as it ought to be.

872,Emotion,ThanksPoemsNoThanksIsNeededPoembyDavidHarris,"It is a good feeling
when you help someone in distress,
impart on them the knowledge
that you have gained.
You feel a great satisfaction
and no thanks is needed.
You are doing something
we should all do at times,
holding out our hand and helping another.
Each of us has been given a gift
and it is how we use that gift
which is the important thing.
If we use that gift
to import happiness into someone’s life
making them feel better within themselves.
How wonderful we feel
whenever they smile with satisfaction
knowing they have done something
to make a dream come true.
We need no thanks for this,
as it is what everyone should do.
Holding out a helping hand
no matter how far it has to stretch
and we can then rest on these words.
Do onto others, as you would
have them do onto you.

Look at how i've grown.

So thanks alot dad.
I can't believe you left mom and i,
I wonder when you left if momm ever cried.
So thanks alot dad.
Momma said you were always alot of fun,
Dad, would you have stayed if momma had a son?
So basicly I hate you dad
The only thing you left me with was a stupid yellow rabbit.

Felt like a turtle race.

875,Emotion,ThanksPoemsNoThanksPoembyivororivorehogg,"There is no way I’d like to be
somebody else: I quite like me.
I’ll never be a household name
but I am happy just the same.
Content to be ordinary
by no means a celebrity.
I have no wish to seek great fame
to me that is a foolish game.
I know my limits and accept.
I have no reason to expect,
that Lady Luck will smile on me
There is no reason I can see.
Why she should, although she could
or so I’ve always understood
The lady’s known for her caprice.
Although she does not always please
the person who she singles out.
Although entertains no doubt
I only hope she won’t choose me
I’m happy to be ordinary."

You.
Not an outward imitation,
But you, inside.
Your radiance filled my world,
And my thoughts were you,
Just you.
And, you made me happy.

And if nothing else happens,
That did.
And that,
Makes you worth more,
Than anything,
I could ever hope for,
Or want."

878,Emotion,ThanksPoemsTanviDamleWroteAnEssayOnMyWorkThanksTanviPoembyAfzalShauq,"Afzal Shauq Has A Vision Of All The World.. By: -Tanvi Damle from India
_____________________________________________ ____
While browsing through poemhunter.com, I stumbled upon Mr. Afzal Shauq's profile. I read his first poem and was so amazed by his writing that i sat the whole say, reading through his amazing work.
Mr. Afzal Shauq..words fail me to describe this great man. All the poets wreck their minds over how to write but Mr Shauq, he's different because he thinks from his heart. Mr. Shauq has achieved something that millions of people like me can only dream of. He has a vision of all the world coming together as one whole country. Mr. Shauq wants the world to live as one. Mr. Shauq preaches in humanity and brotherhood.
According to Mr. Shauq the best weapon to fight a war is 'A Friendly Smile.' Isn't that a brilliant idea? We all dream of world peace and wish for wars to end. But that's about it, we don't do anything beyond that. The difference between Mr. Shauq and us is that he not only dreams of world peace but work's towards making the dream come true. And the best part is Mr. Shauq is not only making his dream come true but ours as well. He has the power to do it through his writing. He has something alot more than talent and what's amazing is that he uses his talent to promote world peace, something that's most important in today's world.
From his unique collection of poem's, inspite of me loving his each poem; there were a few that captured my heart the most. The poem‘ Global Peace Theory’ is one of them…
'Global Peace Theory' / Afzal Shauq
If and when the invincible book of norms is ignored?
If and when custom of humanity is burnt to dust?
Due to the wicked shadows of greed, lust and other evil doings,
We don’t have the right to be named as human beings.
Rather, we are brutal animals like vultures and crocodiles.
If we truly wish from the heart to be called humans of higher race,
Then we must not shrink when we are called “the children of Adam”.
For once we begin to consider ourselves as sons of Adam
Of this verdant mound, of this dry land, of this circling life –
Then we might also try to answer the ancient golden query of………
“Aren’t we cousins to each other? ” or “Aren’t we all brothers and sisters? ”
Hence, let’s all take initiatives to bridge up the gaps between hearts.
To connect all broken knots regardless of color, creed or race,
Via road to positivity, presenting cheerful aura of glowing smiles.
Respect to one another is a blooming string that ties warm cozy ends.
Letting social life be dance and sing melodiously with the collective actions.
Pleasing, filling, satisfying; the glaring shadows of humanity.
In which it has long been betrayed, jumped out of shell,
By the selfish wand and magnetic resonance of greed!
____
In the poem ‘Global Peace Theory’ Mr Shauq has sent out a rather meaningful message. In this poem Mr. Shauq is stressing on the way we human's behave. T he humanity is fading away every second. Human beings are given the power of understanding. But sadly they misuse it by plotting against each other. If so then do we have the right to call ourselves human beings of higher race? Mr. Shauq further quotes that let us all cross the boundaries of one's color, race, religion and country and let us all become a single united nation, filling our hears with nothing but peace
.
'A New Dawn' is yet another example of his amazing talent. Through this poem Mr. Shauq gives hope to millions of people around the world promising them a new dawn, making people's belief stronger
.
The way Mr. Afzal Shauq writes is beautiful, his writing is short, precise and to the point. Mr Shauq's poems always succeed in giving a powerful message to the world. Mr. Shauq's poems take us to a whole new world of peace and give us a ray of hope promising a peaceful future.

A shameful death sentence
To be carried out at the place of a skull
For all to see and mock him
Despite his innocence, clearly proved beyond all doubt
Despite his goodness to all and sundry
Despite his love to everyone
This judgement was upheld by all
But with joy in his heart he embraced his death
So that the will of he, who sent him, may be fulfilled
So that all, including his execusioners, will be reconcilled to the creator
So that no soul will be lost
This is a sacrifice that is beyond all sacrifice
A sacrifice of life which was exceptional

885,Emotion,ThanksPoemsThanksToChancePoembyDavidHarris,"I started out long ago
with a handful of dreams,
but through the years,
every one of them vanished
or so it seemed to me.
They say that chance
plays a big part in our lives,
and it was by chance
someone recognised me
from an old photograph
Now my dreams have returned
and slowly each are coming true.
Just as I turned away
from the road a head,
I have turned back to greater things.
Once I abandoned my life,
felt it was going nowhere.
Thanks to chance
I have found myself again
and a brighter future somewhere.

Are blessings in disguise;
A mother who is wonderful,
A father who is wise.
Thank You for the basics:
Food, clothes, a home.

At least for a while.
I have other writing projects

893,Emotion,ThanksPoemsThisOneForHanqueWithThanksPoembyMichaelShepherd,"All around the world,
poems are talking among themselves
when the books are shut,
when the computers are switched off,
when old-fashioned poets put down
chewed pencils, sucked ballpens,
lips a little stained with the flavour
of ink that’s washable or permanent;
poems talking among themselves
in that language that poems understand,
that poets seek to write;
poems murmuring, complaining,
sometimes shouting desperately,
who are these people who
have dared to speak our language? What
is their right and reason? When
did they arise? Where
did they get their ideas? Why
do they even try? How
do they hope to improve on this? What
is a poet, anyway?
The tumult of their languages,
the babel of upraised voices
speaking, though,  with that unutterable
beauty of that sound which can really act,
can change the world of change,
can touch the heart for lifetimes,
melts a heart of stone,
brings tears to eyes needful of tears,
opens clouds to blue sky and to sunlight,
watches angels as they ascend and descend,
speaks of, speaks,
the unknown, formless, eternal, ever present –
the tumult dies down; in the
silence and the stillness,
only the pure sound of sound itself; and
in that sound the absolution:
forgive them, O Muse of Poetry:
they know not what they do..
yet in their hearts, they know
what must be said.
The pain, exquisite;
found worthy; loved."
894,Emotion,ThanksPoemsTheVoteOfThanksDebatePoembyHenryLawson,"The Other Night I got the blues and tried to smile in vain.
I couldn’t chuck a chuckle at the foolery of Twain;
When Ward and Billings failed to bring a twinkle to my eye,
I turned my eyes to Hansard of the fifteenth of July.
I laughed and roared until I thought that I was growing fat,
And all the boarders came to see what I was laughing at:
It rose the risibility of some, I grieve to state—
That foolish speech of Brentnall’s in the Vote of Thanks debate.
O Brentnall, of the olden school and cold sarcastic style!
You’ll take another WORKER now and stick it on your file;
“We’re very fond of poetry,”—we hope that this is quite
As entertaining as the lines you read the other night.
We know that you are honest, but ’twas foolish to confess
You read and file the WORKER; we expected something less.
We think an older member would have told the people, so—
“My attention was directed to a certain print” (—you know).
The other night in Parliament you quoted something true,
Where truth is very seldom heard except from one or two.
You know that when the people rise the other side must fall,
And you are on the other side, and that explains it all.
You hate the Cause by instinct, the instinct of your class,
And fear the reformation that shall surely come to pass;
Your nest is feathered by the “laws” which you of course defend,
Your daily bread is buttered on the upper crust, my friend.
“We aim at broader interests,” you say, and so we do;
We aim at “vested interests” (the gun is loaded too).
We hate the wrongs we write against. We’ve felt the curse of Greed.
There’s little nonsense in the school where Labour earns its creed.
But you know little of the Cause that you are running down.
You would deny there’s misery and hardship in the town;
Yet I could take you through the hells where Poverty holds sway,
And show you things you’d not forget until your dying day.
O Brentnall! Have you ever tramped the city streets within?
And felt the pavement wearing through the leather, sock, and skin;
And looked for work, and asked for work, and begged for work in vain,
Until you cared not though you ne’er might touch your tools again.
O Brentnall! Have you ever felt the summer sun and dirt?
And wore the stiffened socks for weeks, for weeks the single shirt?
And shunned your friends like small-pox—passing on the other side—
And crept away in shadows with your misery and pride?
Another solemn member rose encouraged by the cheers,
And talked of serving medals to our gallant volunteers,
And extra uniforms, that they might hand the old ones on
“As heirlooms in the family” when they are dead and gone.
But since the state of future times is very much in doubt,
They’d better wear their uniforms, they’d better wear them out;
They may some day be sorry for the front that they have shown,
And, e’er the nap is worn away, they mightn’t like it known.
The children of a future time shall read, with awe profound,
How goslings did the goose-step while a gander led ’em round.
O Brentnall! Speak your periods into a phonograph,
That generations yet to rise may lay them down and laugh.
I wouldn’t trust the future much; Posterity might own
That sense of the ridiculous that you have never shown;
And not the smiles of Mammon, nor the pride of place and pelf,
Can soothe the thought that one has made a jackass of one’s self.
We’re low, but we would teach you if you’re willing to be taught,
That in the wilderness of print are tartars still uncaught;
And if you hunt in such a way—believe we do not jest—
Your chance to catch one is as good, and better than the best.
Be very sure about the mark before you cast the stone,
And, well, perhaps ’twould be as well to leave the muse alone.
You’ll call it egotism? Yes: but still I think that I
Might hit a little harder if I only liked to try."

Sunday,18th August 2019
I may look harsh
but rush
to address the damage done
I regret it later even
don't go by my utterances
they are at once
spoken with a raging mind
and find no place elsewhere
I can't choose appropriate words
and use them to forward
my sentiments and feelings
I try to be honest as a good human being
I expect people to be lenient
kind and considerate at present
as I am losing the sympathy
and have lost the credible ground already
my heart reflects in the eyes
so try
and read the intention
that shall be helpful for the mutual relation

902,Emotion,SympathyPoemsSheDoesDeserveGreatSympathyPoembyFrancisDuggan,"Ageing Bella in the house at the corner outdoors she is not often seen
She was a potential swimming Olympian till a motoring accident she had at eighteen
Brought an end to her swimming career back in ninteen seventy three
And condemned her to life in a wheelchair she does deserve great sympathy.
She could not compete in the Olympics and swim her way into renown
And become the toast of the Nation and the heroine of her Hometown
It robbed her of her chance of having children she has never been any man's wife
one might say she was quite unlucky that accident ruined her life.
She is quite an attractive woman her brown hair flecked with strands of gray
She had spent years of her life in a wheelchair seven to ten years before her prime day
when I meet her she smiles and says hello but sometimes she looks rather sad
I can only empathize with her a terrible life she has had.
Thirty six of her fifty four years in a wheelchair since her widowed mum died five years ago she has lived on her own
Lady luck is surely against her a terrible life she has known
Confined to a wheelchair due to a car crash on the highway which robbed her of her chance of fame
In swimming she was a young champion and for herself making a name."

When the sun is bright on the upland slopes;
When the wind stirs soft through the springing grass,
And the river flows like a stream of glass;
When the first bird sings and the first bud opes,
And the faint perfume from its chalice steals--
I know what the caged bird feels!
I know why the caged bird beats his wing
Till its blood is red on the cruel bars;
For he must fly back to his perch and cling
When he fain would be on the bough a-swing;
And a pain still throbs in the old, old scars
And they pulse again with a keener sting--
I know why he beats his wing!
I know why the caged bird sings, ah me,
When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,--
When he beats his bars and he would be free;
It is not a carol of joy or glee,
But a prayer that he sends from his heart's deep core,
But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings--
I know why the caged bird sings!"

these consolatory words are enough to break me..
“just be stronger”…  and you’ll make it..
“think happier” and your internal world will change it…
there is no cure there is no treatment…
when I smile it’s because I fake it…
I want to see the last day through as someone who was there and unshaken..
I hide my feelings bury my tears..
tell them all there’s nothing to fear.. “I’m going to make it”..
but inside my lungs burn and my capillaries cry.. an iron rich fluid..
I know because too often I taste it..
“take a deep breath and calm your mind”…
sounds so serene and tranquil..
but as I breathe my lungs scream trying to expand against this ever tightening rubber band..
when finally it’s too much and my face is about to betray the pain that ravages and consumes my brain..
I move to deflate these natural balloons with such a horrid fate…
struggling to move these scores of molecules through airways that feel no bigger than a hair…
and as if this wasn’t already enough the medical bills pile up…
the vampire system reaches for the last clean slate you thought you’d save in case one day they told you you’re safe..
but it’s too late the trapper’s snare’s already determined your fate.."

He seems bent on a mission
To paint a bleak vision
His elation isn’t disguised!
I’ve them aplenty
My eyes bloodied
In surgeon’s needles
Retinal detachment
Cataract
Glaucoma
There isn’t a trauma
My eyes haven’t suffered
His eyeballs roll
On the sclera
In perverse pleasure
I don’t mind
If I go blind,
The misery around
Doesn’t make eyesight a treasure
I haven’t met a man
To himself this inhuman
Treating the most valued lens
With such immense disdains
More than my suffering eyes
He says in glee undisguised
I suffer your cruelty,
That’s when you say
It’s my way
To garner sympathy!"

909,Emotion,SympathyPoemsSympathyForTheTalibanPoembyRajDronamraju,"I've got marginal feelings about intelligent females
Show me one who hasn't grown an extra layer of hatred
Who doesn't justify decadence with libertarian reasoning
And will give someone average an honest chance
I made one-sided pleasant conversation to a girl once; she told me to get lost
I tried to express my feelings about women to America; they told me to shut up
I shopped around for a better culture in order to make friends
And found a few that offered up some opportunities
I fell in love with a girl
And she took control of me
This I did not mind
Until one day I woke up and felt something had passed me by
I fell in love with another girl
And she melded with me and we became a single celled organism
This I really liked
And I never felt the need to split into another shape
These other women and girls are full of first world problems
This does not compute, I'll go somewhere else
Where I can sort out my competing lonely thoughts
They'll threaten you with coherence for finally voicing your displeasure
The crowd disperses after the stoning
Someone will clean up the blood while others go back to work
The sound of religious verses hang like smog in the air
Sympathy for the Taliban"

911,Emotion,SympathyPoemsAcceptMySympathyPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"In all sincerity
It is a pathetic pity
I merely offer sympathy
With such velocity
This sadness born out of the blue
That decides to levy itself on you
In your fixed stillness
I sense your illness
Accept my sympathy
You lost a pet
Somebody made you upset
Accept my sympathy
You lost a friend
Your broken heart is yet to mend
Accept my sympathy
You were once abused
Possibly at times wrongly accused
Accept my sympathy
You marriage is on the rocks
You got divorced, left without a buck
Accept my sympathy
You lost a fortune
Your voice can't sing a decent tune
Accept my sympathy
You lost in love or lost your job
Or perhaps at one stage got robbed
Accept my sympathy
Your life is a mess
Everything around you depresses
Whatever the circumstances
Accept my sympathy
And if I happen to show no sympathy
Please accept my sympathy!

912,Emotion,SympathyPoemsWithoutDonatedSympathyPoembyLawrenceSPertillar,"They are afraid to be discovered,
As imbeciles!
So to avoid this exposure...
Laws were amended.
Rules were changed!
Quotas were enforced
To keep those deranged in control!
And even though everyone pays the price,
For their lack of knowledge and skill...
Or guidance with advice!
Those who have been subjected,
To this effective neglect that has affected respect...
Stand on the sidelines
Forced to hear them whine,
About every aspect of their sorrows!
With or without donated sympathy.
Hoping tomorrow...
Care packages of 'insight'
Is dropped by the tons from the sky!
'Let's keep out fingers crossed! '"

If any help it wants to be

Where is this trust I've heard so much about
but can't seem to find
And to the world in which I stay
don't hate me when I say
'This identical state of mind
from the glass we look through
can you locate the hopes of the citizens
you erase
You know our names and our faces
but could you take one look at a blooming blue rose
straight in the eye and call it ugly
Could you look at a hummingbird
and ask for its wings to cease it's beat
We are the angels of this life
All we need is our wings
so could you help me find mine
the ones I lost some time ago"

And you have a better chance with a conniving individual
Those crying people, lying people, I-would-rather-die people
Are often the best allies you'll ever have
Why is that you may ask.
Well those shy people are blind people, they unfortunately live a lie, those people
Switching sides, their sympathy will cling to your mistakes
And then there's the other kind
Those open-eyed people, wild people, not-afraid-to-speak-their-mind people
See the wreck of a world, and you, a star engraved in the bark"

On the cheek of your sovereign rose,

919,Emotion,SympathyPoemsSaveYourSympathyPoembyFrancisDuggan,"Save your sympathy for the poor living instead
Of wasting your tears and pity on the dead
Since they are past suffering and any living care
But the poor living in need of help are no longer rare
People are dying of malnutrition every day
And fleeing for their lives from war zones far away
They live in places surrounded by fear
And why weep for the dead when the dead do not hear
The poor every day life's survival battle have to face
Many of them are Stateless and without a Home-place
They are in need of compassion, kindness and empathy
And they surely could do with some sympathy
That the dead are past suffering i can only believe
And they do not hear you sobbing when for them you do grieve."
920,Emotion,SympathyPoemsSympathyForUsIsRarePoembyBriMar,"A woman's work is never done,
Being one is just no fun,
Beware the moaning has just begun.
Life just isn't fair.
Take the cleaning it's so hard,
The frying pan filled with lard,
Too much bleach leaves me scarred,
From mops I do beware.
Loading up the washing machine,
All those dishes I must clean,
It's heavy going this caffeine,
I need someone to share.
Filthy toilets I don't even use?
I clean up what you abuse,
I think I'm going to blow a fuse,
Why is it you don't care.
The Dyson needs emptying now,
He says darling I don't know how,
Wiping the sweat from my brow,
I collapse on to the chair.
Doing my hair and make up too,
My all over tan I love to do,
Just so I look nice for you,
Then all you do is stare.
Giving birth the ultimate task,
How did it happen don't dare ask,
Never again will I leave my Basque,
Don't you bloody dare?
Time of the month is it here to stay,
Menopause, please go away,
A woman's life let us pray,
No wonder we bloody swear.
Luckily enough our stamina's strong,
Sussing you out doesn't take long,
We're always right and never wrong,
That look will always scare.
How dare you ask me why I brood?
Praying I'm always in the mood,
Even you men must conclude,

921,Emotion,SympathyPoems32VivekanandaSympathyForUntouchablesPoembyRajaramRamachandran,"At Rajputana, in a religious meet
Swamiji came to participate,
But none cared for his rest,
Or for his food at least.
A poor low caste man
Gave him with hesitation
Some uncooked food
As cooked one was prohibited.
As he was an untouchable,
The high class people,
Kept him at a distance
In all the functions.
Taking pity on him,
Swamiji then told him
“Bring your cooked food,
For me, it’s good.”
On seeing his kindness,
The poor man shed tears,
And gave him cooked meal,
That, in fact, tasted well
Swamiji felt, “The poor people
Who’re so good and simple,
Live in huts as untouchables.
And such people, we despise.”
For many days, with no food,
At some places, he remained.
He stayed then with sweepers
Who were treated as outcastes.
They were very simple,
As well as more humble,
And possessed many virtues
Of true spiritual values.
Many times, Swamiji wept.
“Why such men are kept
At the feet of our society
Without any kind of mercy? ”
For them, Swamiji prayed,
Wherever he had stayed,
For their speedy deliverance
From this unpardonable injustice."

923,Emotion,SympathyPoemsIHaveAStrongSympathyAndAGreatRespectPoembyHebertLogerie,"I have a great sympathy for the caged bird
Who would like to lean on the wings of the clouds
I'm sorry for this little guy who dreams
And who suffers night and day. The sun is rising
And brings him hollow, wacky, and empty hopes
I'm sorry for this brave and timid bird
Who wants to fly in the clouds
I have a strong sympathy for the caged bird.
The bird tries to beat its bruised wings, alas!
He makes furtive efforts. He's like the shark in the trap
Who is swimming and fighting to get out of this fateful situation
It's the little Negro who plows in the labyrinth of the Americas
Listen carefully to the humming of his cries and miseries
At night, he can barely breathe, rest, and close his eyelids
He is hungry, thirsty, enervated, and tired of struggling with the life
Of this society which is full of insomnia, injustice and ignominy.
The bird is too weak to sing the songs of yesterday
Despite all the vicissitudes, he remains courageous and proud
The bird cries its misfortunes, its desires for exile
Forcibly, he wants to flee for refuge under another sky
The little Negro regains his strength slowly and gradually
One day, he will undoubtedly cross the vaults like a kite
To settle properly on the velvety carpet of the clouds
Comrades, I have a lot of respect for this bird once caged.
P.S. This poem is dedicated to Paul Dunbar, Dr. Maya Angelou and the brave of our world.

Show your bones
Where do you lay?

For you offer more
Than simple desire
Treat me- I will take
Far more than I could
Ever deserve- Yet, ha!

To take what is given
Offered to me
On a silver platter
Nevertheless- Would I-
Could I- care to notice

Stars illuminate the darkness that night my heart amazing
I still sit down and read the silence
Peel the skins memories that become embedded in spirit
And grain flavor that started accompanying the hearts of all the senses

Although not as if I will survive
I will keep trying to survive and survive
To you my reason to survive
I do not care whatever happens between us
But I may know what you feel in your heart
When I walked away from you
My inner voice, screaming, mountain life abort
And I never sleep without kissing your shadow
As if longing urge you to come back again
Once inside, holy, eternal and sincere

So simple but so hard to say"

Thou past heroic forms unmoved shalt go,
To pause and bide with me, to whisper low:
""Not I alone am weak, not I apart
Must suffer, struggle, conquer day by day.

Here is my bosom-sin wherefrom I pray
Hourly deliverance--this my rose, my thorn.

Stretching o'er silent gulfs her sister hand."""

In my computer sitting adjacent
to the hall window, about nine O’ clock!
Within the glance of my eyes on left side,
I noticed something wriggling outer side
Closer to the compound wall inner side!
Shocked to see a snake moving forward steadily
I went out of my house through back door carefully
Taking a long wooden broad stick to beat it!
Hearing my approaching sound,
the baby snake turned around
I wanted to beat and kill it!
Since I noticed it is only a week old,
I felt whether to leave it to reach its mother safely
Or to kill, not to give chance to come back frequently!
But while it is moving carefully,
It raised its head very slightly,
Spreading its hood so gently!
Warning me every now and then,
Hey, be careful! I am a baby cobra!
I understood now it is a baby cobra!
I didn't try to beat it,
Is it due to fear?
Is it due to sympathy?
While I was not deciding,
It went through crevices
Between the cement slabs!
To visit my brother’s house
next day next door, since
firmly I closed the crevice!"

Darkness has enveloped everything'?
Hearing the nightingale wailing thus
A glow-worm lurking nearby spoke thus
'With my heart and soul ready to help I am
Though only an insignificant insect I am
Never mind if the night is dark
I shall shed light if the way is dark

He has given a shining lamp to me

Ready to be useful to others who are"

This squirrel was killed last night, while crossing the road.
Few years, I traveled this road, back and forth
Many times, I was afraid that this squirrel might be struck dead.
The other day, I pushed my car break to a sudden stop.
This squirrel was standing in the middle of the road,
Too scared, it ran in circle, not sure of where to escape.
It escaped its death because of its best luck.
Last night, this squirrel was struck.

‘' Its unique to us ‘'
That's what you'd have others believe,
While you kill and maim,
Without any fuss,
I think it's yourselves you deceive.
The human being,
Is certainly unique,
But, not in the way you portray,
You're not all seeing,
Fact is, you're weak,
No-one believes what you say.
You live for now,
Forget what's ahead,
The future just doesn't apply,
Don't ask how,
The billions are fed,
You accept those starving should die.
You cannot restore,
What's forever gone,
By refusing to show all life respect,
When it's no more,
There's no new dawn,
The diversity of life you have wrecked.
If you're so clever,
Ask yourselves why,
The planet you live on is dying,
Each life you sever,
It's yourself you deny,
Yet death, you find so edifying.
As your end draws near,
What's left draw breath,
To watch you all die they're impassioned,
There's a lifting of fear,
As you meet with death,
For the human,

From those who have chosen to move on.

Hidden from the world,
wiped with the palms
And the hands
And the eyelids red with,
The eyelashes smeared with
Rubbing and wiping,
Is this called love,
Is love suffering?

Then stood erect and spoke my thanks,
And blessed his charity.
I lay in want, and grief, and pain,

950,Emotion,SympathyPoemsSympathyPoembyHenryDavidThoreau,"Lately alas I knew a gentle boy,
Whose features all were cast in Virtue's mould,
As one she had designed for Beauty's toy,
But after manned him for her own strong-hold.
On every side he open was as day,
That you might see no lack of strength within,
For walls and ports do only serve alway
For a pretence to feebleness and sin.
Say not that Cćsar was victorious,
With toil and strife who stormed the House of Fame;
In other sense this youth was glorious,
Himself a kingdom wheresoe'er he came.
No strength went out to get him victory,
When all was income of its own accord;
For where he went none other was to see,
But all were parcel of their noble lord.
He forayed like the subtle breeze of summer,
That stilly shows fresh landscapes to the eyes,
And revolutions worked without a murmur,
Or rustling of a leaf beneath the skies.
So was I taken unawares by this,
I quite forgot my homage to confess;
Yet now am forced to know, though hard it is,
I might have loved him, had I loved him less.
Each moment, as we nearer drew to each,
A stern respect withheld us farther yet,
So that we seemed beyond each other's reach,
And less acquainted than when first we met.
We two were one while we did sympathize,
So could we not the simplest bargain drive;
And what avails it now that we are wise,
If absence doth this doubleness contrive?
Eternity may not the chance repeat,
But I must tread my single way alone,
In sad remembrance that we once did meet,
And know that bliss irrevocably gone.
The spheres henceforth my elegy shall sing,
For elegy has other subject none;
Each strain of music in my ears shall ring
Knell of departure from that other one.
Make haste and celebrate my tragedy;
With fitting strain resound ye woods and fields;
Sorrow is dearer in such case to me
Than all the joys other occasion yields.
Is't then too late the damage to repair?
Distance, forsooth, from my weak grasp hath reft
The empty husk, and clutched the useless tare,
But in my hands the wheat and kernel left.
If I but love that virtue which he is,
Though it be scented in the morning air,
Still shall we be truest acquaintances,
Nor mortals know a sympathy more rare."
951,Emotion,SympathyPoemsSympathyForSurvivorsOfAPakistaniMassMurderOfChildrenPoembyBillGrace,"The man in the locker room told me of their murders
'It is beyond evil.' he said.
Dave Franks a great preacher and good chaplain
at another time of sadness said:
'What an animal'
I can only sadly echo here:
'What an animal'
and shake my head in sadness
while trying to remember where
I have put my gun."
952,Emotion,SympathyPoemsWordsOfSympathyPoembyRaulMoreno,"My condolences can’t ease the pain,
That you have come to feel.
Nor fill the void in your heart,
That often seems unreal.
But it lets your heart know,
That you are in my prayers.
And when sorrow digs its heels,
There is someone here who cares.
I offer healing words of comfort,
And many hugs for sympathy.
When sorrowful clouds blotch your sky,
You can always depend on me."
953,Emotion,SympathyPoemsWithAllTheSympathyPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"A person is called saint if he has kindness with all the sympathy
He can claim then only as direct descendent of almighty
Or Messiah, messenger or for that respect an angel
At every inch you must look ordinary but with different angle
I have known or heard about many of such figures
They have worked for the humanity and reassured
About the human misery and risk involved for apathy
What work is to be taken up or followed to gain His sympathy?
Each work is evaluated and appreciated by God
Many might have lost favor as their soul stands sold
They are burden and living animal on earth
At each stage they live on but with the fear of death
To work under such difficult situation is Herculean task
No one may opt for it or readily go and ask
Some of the great souls are easily picked on earth
God has always created such situation without any dearth
Such a kind of saints have prevailed in present time
For the rescue of mankind with their known and committed crimes
Hardly anybody can undertake such enterprise
It is much to relief and to our surprise
It proves God's existence
We feel and experience His presence
He is omni present and in every individual
Only we fail to understand Him and take very casual
If some one works on charity or any kind of human service
That may be counted as noble cause and looked upon very nice
All kinds of help will be rendered and efforts lauded
His or her presence will be taken with high esteem and applauded
It is not done to gain international fame
It may involve great work and full of blames
Little slackness may invite lots of criticism
As it isli9nked with the work of humanism
Thousands of hands are raised in your well being
Prayers and congregations are held to praise and sing
Preaching is done so as to spread the kind and love message
The sick and ill fated souls are shown the way with passage
The services of poor may be remembered very long
It is not only the care and help but to stay among
Not showing mere finger for any work to be done
The far reaching impact will never be undone
Some of the names may be remembered by all
As they have responded with charity and humanitarian call
Anybody could do it without any assistance
But it has made some difference with their presence"

956,Emotion,SympathyPoemsPleasureWasNoSympathyPoembyAmyOrmonde,"I was quiet in the corner
He whispered in my ear
'come closer'
I could feel something begin to race
My heart
as it began to swell and violently pace
He picked me up
then sat me down
on the edge of my bed
I began looking around
I was fearing at first
as to what we may do
and then he walked back into the room
His angelic face
pearing down at me
touching me gently
as though to swoo me
Hey laid me back
kissing softly
I could feel temptation
as my heart bethrough me
He began to arouse me gently
and softly
as though to know what it was I had wanted
as he caressed
I could feel the pleasure
all through me
watching in silence
he knew what to do to me
as slowly as we had began
our clothes where off
and we had sinned
he was watching in enjoyment
amazed by all his poise
and then he laid on top of me
and I began to moan
Pleasure was no sympathy
as I am glad at what he did to me
and i laid there in his arms
he said ' I love you'
and I was gone"
957,Emotion,SympathyPoemsSympathyPoembyMohdArshad,"We christen things
We call them
By their names
Names are famous
And infamous
The wind blows
In different directions
What should I call
My sympathy?
A relation,
A compensation,
A smart help,
Or a prayer to God
For my anguish,
Scattered on the floor?
It is a pillow
For their heavy heads,
A salty soup
Or a cup of confection,
Doesn't interest them.
Envy is ripe,
Very palpable
To their tongues.
They will accuse me
And handcuff
My wings
They will take it
As a nodule on the nose
I dread despicable things
I fear life too
Bereft of commiseration"

959,Emotion,SympathyPoemsInSympathyMeltForJenWallsPoembyCPSharma,"She ever shines in God's grace
Knows no calumny towards any race
Her face with eternal peace glows
Love's fountain in her heart flows
In divinity she everyday dips
Prayer always sits on her lips
Sympathy in her looks
Charity in her outlook
In her ears Geeta, Gurbani and Bible ring
Her tongue the songs of wellbeing sing
Ever in blessedness her soul abounds
Her mind a rosary, love beads counts
Butter soft her heart, in sympathy melts
Jen Walls‘knees in prayer ever knelt"
960,Emotion,SympathyPoemsDeepestSympathyPoembyRoseAnnVShawiak,"Softened clouds of dismay are arranged
periodically in systems of disarray.
Lasting thoughts coalesce and brew many
new ideas of imagination.
All of them taking me into tunnels of
reminiscence and being remembered in times
of creative sadness as it caresses our hearts in
sorrow, holding us in deepest sympathy with our souls."
961,Emotion,SympathyPoemsSympathyPoembyRobertWilliamService,"My Muse is simple,--yet it's nice
To think you don't need to think twice
On words I write.
I reckon I've a common touch
And if you say I cuss too much
I answer: 'Quite!'
I envy not the poet's lot;
He has something I haven't got,
Alas, I know.
But I have something maybe he
Would envy just a mite in me,--
I'm rather low.
For I am cast of common clay,
And from a ditch I fought my way,
And that is why
The while the poet scans the skies,
My gaze is grimly gutterwise,
Earthy am I.
And yet I have a gift, perhaps
Denied to proud poetic chaps
Who scoff at me;
I know the hearts of humble folk;
I too have bowed beneath the yoke:
So let my verse for them evoke
Your sympathy."

963,Emotion,SympathyPoemsSympathyAndTimePoembyGangadharannairPulingat,"Mere sympathy only a show
A fascination of modern days
Actual need is the timely help
That too without knowing anyone
The left hand is absent minded
When right hand gives a help
Those are services to humanity
Those which judges somewhere in life
Sympathy in terms of publicity
A craze in different platforms hear
Most of times timely service require
Which is action oriented and result fruitful."
964,Emotion,SympathyPoemsTheyDonTHaveAnySympathyForMePoembyAldoKraas,"They don't have any sympathy for me
Because when I try to explain something it goes in in one ear and Comes out the other
Sometimes I even wonder if they got the message at all
It is even hard to say
Maybe they don't speak  english well enough to understand me
Have I tought of that?
No I never consider it
Maybe that is a fact"

Thursday, June 14,2018
6: 30 PM
It is God's grace
that you face
this cruel world
and yet remain in the main fold
Whether it is able body
Or with deformity
No one end's life
Even if it is full of strife
People take it as a challenge
And adjust to the growing age
Even though some people have born with no legs
They never lag behind
Some people have lost the hands
But life to them seems to be no end
I have seen the people working with legs
Writing, painting and even attaching the tags
Yes, society is also showing sympathy
They show empathy
And even rush to their help if needed
And show the gesture and they remain aided

Not to come here.

968,Emotion,SympathyPoemsEmpathyAndSympathyPoembyBazialisSubrataRay,"Love turns to empathy when one sees God in all,
The sharing of the self in life's rise and fall.
Fostered humbleness, blooms the empathy's flower,
And with it God's bliss, spontaneously showers.
While sympathy is Ego’s hubris,
Authority of superiority finds release
Empathy is a cry for other’s suffering,
Sharing oneness  with all human beings
Sympathy is worldly and mercy it may  trace,
Empathy sees itself in all living face.

972,Emotion,SympathyPoemsSympathyPoembyEmilyJaneBrontë,"There should be no despair for you
While nightly stars are burning,
While evening pours its silent dew
And sunshine gilds the morning.
There should be no despair - though tears
May flow down like a river:
Are not the best beloved of years
Around your heart forever?
They weep - you weep - it must be so;
Winds sigh as you are sighing,
And Winter sheds his grief in snow
Where Autumn's leaves are lying:
Yet these revive, and from their fate
Your fate cannot be parted,
Then journey on, if not elate,
Still, never broken-hearted!"

I'll keep stepping and stepping

And looked in the shadows of your eyes showing
Steps in any direction
I understand its true that made me compassion
Because you are beautiful universe
Because you have wanted to own
something I got
And to me thou fairest nymph
Among all the angel who dwells in heaven
When the night wind swept stars
It was just me, the moon and your shadow
I just do not care how crazy and be so
I sat in the meadow that extend
Slowly I fall down my body right
And I looked sharp and bright shining moon
There was a gnawing loneliness night song
My body feels lifted and flying
Towards the dark side of moon
I saw you dancing in the bright light of the moon
But like a dream that never real
I never reach your
And my body suddenly slammed hard
In the mountain hard and sharp coral
Only I get sick and wounded
Why did I formerly sympathy to you?
What could this something wrong with me?"

Хотя слеза, реке подобна.
И вот прошли любви года.
Его забыть ты не способна.
Но плакать - в этом нет греха.
Тоскует ветер, как душа.
Падёт и снег - зимы слеза,
Где листья падали кружа.

Хоть долог тяжкий путь смирения,
Но сердце жизни не забудет."

Spread it all over me,

until any crumb of my own
is smothered beneath the
weight of your sorrow.
The odds of us sharing some
similar ruin are not as
high as say…a woman
over thirty-five getting killed
by terrorists before getting married?
Give me silvery music to whelm
the wailing of the night,
and wrap me in it,
plucking the strings of my
own suffering as you enswathe me,
tuning them to some pleasing, light opera.
I like you, might even love you,
yet there’s something undeniable about
the satisfaction of feeling exempt
from a condition worse than my own.
What is real is that neither of us
want to hear about the
greater circumstance of the other.
It lowers the loser’s odds considerably,
of ever overcoming.
This strange nature is the thing
which keeps us moving,
despite the laws of probability."

I am trying to show you I care; but it never comes out right;
I am trying to make it work; even when I know its falling apart;
Am by you; because I know it is not fair;
Walking out of the door crosses my mind;
Never coming back is a done deal;
How could I: when my heart longs for you;
Making up my mind; is harder than it seems:
Am by you; because I know it is not fair;
Longing for another is what my heart does;
Wanting to be yours but my heart cant let go;
My heart tells me am greedy;
What has become of me;
Am by you; because I know it is not fair;
Our hands seem at a side line;
We are either together or falling apart;
I make you happy but my priorities are forgone like the dust;
How can sympathy blend into love;
Am by you; because I know it is not fair:"

Always hip on what the story is, he’s broke without a penny.
Filled with messages from the broken hearts, he knows their plight in the entirety.
Got the grip on every politic, he just wished there wasn’t any.
Robin Hood waiting for Marion, could it be that
all the good in the world’s is done.
It was everyone’s big wish we could find the shining sun.
I pray to God His staff and rod will guide us.
Lost forgotten is our man of arms, SYMPATHY FOR THE UNDERDOG.
He’s kicked and mocked and trampled on, empathy for the underdog.
He stands for Don Quixote’s song, SYMPATHY FOR THE UNDERDOG.
He hides in the forest deep with a rabbit amidst the wilds.
Gone away from all the world like ours to meditate upon it.
Filled with answers but shy he will keep till the moment is ripe and mild.
Every ear will turn and listen as He recites His lovely sonnets.
There he stood singing His passion’s song, could it be that
all the good has turned to wrong?
It was many days until a gong whence rang amongst this throng.
I summon God to pass along His wisdom.
Lost forgotten is our man of arms, SYMPATHY FOR THE UNDERDOG.
He’s kicked and mocked and trampled on, empathy for the underdog.
He stands for Don Quixote’s song, SYMPATHY FOR THE UNDERDOG.
Like a lightning bolt His Word will strike.
Shaking mountains and bursting dykes
flowing out upon a troubled world.
His soul will shine like a morning star.
My heart will be there for Him
always faithful through thick and thin
and justice will be rendered then
and hope will reach the dark and grim.
Lost forgotten is our man of arms, SYMPATHY FOR THE UNDERDOG.
He’s kicked and mocked and trampled on, empathy for the underdog.

I neither moved nor smiled:
Joy held her silent at my feet,
My shining lily-child.
She raised her face and looked in mine;
She deemed herself denied;
The door was shut, there was no shine;
Poor she was left outside!
Once, twice, three times, with infant grace
Her lips my name did mould;
Her face was pulling at my face-
She was but ten months old.
I saw; the sight rebuked my sighs;
It made me think-Does God
Need help from his poor children's eyes
To ease him of his load?
Ah, if he did, how seldom then
The Father would be glad!
If comfort lay in the eyes of men,
He little comfort had!
We cry to him in evil case,
When comfort sore we lack;
And when we troubled seek his face,
Consoled he sends us back;
Nor waits for prayer to rise and climb-
He wakes the sleeping prayer;
He is our father all the time,
And servant everywhere.
I looked not up; foreboding hid
Kept down my heart the while;
'Twas he looked up; my Father did
Smile in my infant's smile."

another place.
Life is worn inside out, filled with doubt and
insecurity.
How can life go on in a trench so deep and mired with
sadness?
So quiet, so gently, everything turned around and no
more feeling was felt.
Away from it all to a deserted isle within, hidden
from all, attempting to follow heart's desires.
Silently waiting for forlorn music to end this sympathy
symphony held daily within.
Taking notice of images, always standing within reach,
contemplating their worth when life is done.
All is lost, there is no more to work with.
Life has ended on this quiet, forlorn afternoon.
And no one is the wiser for it."

993,Emotion,SympathyPoemsSympathyPoembyEdgarAlbertGuest,"Sympathy
One came to the house with a pretty speech:
'It's all for the best,' said he,
And I know that he sought my heart to reach,
And I know that he grieved with me.
But I was too full of my sorrow then
To list to his words or care;
Though I've tried I cannot recall again
The comfort he gave me there.
But another came, and his lips were dumb
As he grasped me by the hand,
And he stammered: 'Old man, I had to come,
Oh, I hope you'll understand.'
And ever since then I have felt his hand
Clasped tightly in my own,
And to-day his silence I understand-
My sorrowing he had known."

996,Emotion,SympathyPoemsSympathyPoembyJAProudfoot,"I took out the photographs from the drawer,
and laid us on the bed.
I had kept them pressed like wild flowers,
and now I sought a key
in each of these paper blooms,
to unlock the lexicon of you.
But instead I was crushed
by their single dimension.
All your things stare at me….
Your shoes,
sit,
by the door,
like a tired old dog.
You were never tidy but now
your leavings cut me
like little knives,
and I am mugged
by your memory.
Today I unzipped your hospital case,
took out your blue striped pyjamas and let
my fingers find the cuff and fray.
Unmended…..
Promised…..
Just touching them is just touching you,
in the hospital bed,
stubbled, grey
and oh so cold.
Now I want to be difficult.
My life has been made less ordinary by your death,
and even in your death you continue to define me.
I can feel your boney grasp upon the chain
that binds me to you,
and if I submit,
you will surely drag me to the grave
with all the other widows,
offering mindless
sympathy."

they always look at it,
but...
it never stops for anyone,
it moves round and round in one direction,
it has three good friends in it who never fight,
the worlds depends on it...

I fought harder and harder
To get the happiness back
I weeps frequently
I smiles frequently
Happiness is what I want in return
Having him support me
Gave me a happiness
Sadness have strikes me
I fought harder and harder
To get happiness back
I wore masks thousand times
I pretend and it hurt
Having him to take off my mask
To reveal the truth out of me
Gave me a happiness
Sadness have strikes me
I fought harder and harder
To get the happiness back
My heart is shattered
I grabbed a broom to gather it together
I cries
Having him glue my heart all together
Brought me into happiness once again."

1001,Emotion,HappinessPoemsContentmentIsTheCoreToHappinessPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"Buying a car today would be so nice!
Having a car thats old is quite alright;
Getting a car tomorrow would be wise!
Changing a car each day would not be right.
Having something thats old is good enough;
Having something today seems still better;
Having something tomorrow is quite tough;
Yet, satisfaction's prime that must matter.
Each thing in time has its advantages;
Postponement's not something you always do;
One shouldn't decide slowly or take ages;
All things have demerits and beauty too!
Yet, values old have stood the test of time!
And modern things don't make life more sublime!"

But what I see is something else,

Happiness should be free,

Happiness cost some their life and home,

Happiness can be free,

What now to guide my dreams?

Swiftly expelling the gloomy night.

To be shaped and to redesign,
And each move will be, by you
So perfect, so right and fine.
The birds will start their song,
And delight in this newborn day,
And with your courage so strong,
Exhilaration will come your way.
Greet the bright  dawn with joy,
Don't give in to tears and stress,
Find nothing that might annoy,
Come to know complete happiness."
1011,Emotion,HappinessPoemsHappinessPoembyMonicaParis,"It's not so much the world outside

It's more the thoughts within our head

Thoughts of special people

and memories of the happy times we've shared
from day to day.
I often wonder on a day like this
If you've ever guessed.
How many times the thought of you
has brought me happiness."
1012,Emotion,HappinessPoemsTrueHappinessIsPoembySharonLNorris,"Sharing each other’s hopes and dreams.
Caring about what happens to each other.
Respecting each other’s goals and ambitions.
Committing to share everything with each other.
Making decisions together like all good teams do.
Being there for the bad times as well as the good.
Trusting the other to do the right thing in the relationship.
Knowing each other so well that reacting becomes instinctive.
Believing the whole relationship is the sum of two halves together.
Loving each other for person they are, not the person they could be."

1014,Emotion,HappinessPoemsSuccessIsNotHappinessHappinessIsSuccessPoembyAiRAtmaninRavi,"If Success was Happiness
Then achievers would be glad
But look around and you will find
That many of them are sad
Of course, Achievement gives joy
And excitement, oh boy!
But when our need becomes our greed
To misery, this will lead
The whole world is chasing Success
Everyone wants achievement
Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose
There is no Contentment
Why do people want to succeed?
Why is everyone in a race?
The Truth is that we want to win
So that there is a smile on our face
But though we win, we are not glad
We have money, why are we sad?
Happiness is not money, the sages said
It's sleeping soundly when you are in bed
We hear of suicides in the homes of the rich
If they were Happy, then why this glitch?
Although they are achievers, this fact we know
They are not Happy, their face has no glow
If successful, but unhappy, what is the use?
Winning or smiling, what would you choose?
The purpose of Success is for us to be glad
What is the use of winning, if it makes us sad?
Happiness is something different, we learn
Not just money that we earn and burn
Happiness is built on a foundation of peace
Then we are blissful like waves in the seas
Look around at the people who are glad
They live in the moment, they are never sad
They don't swing from the future to the past
They are the ones whose Happiness lasts
Happiness has no price tag, know this my friend
It's a state of mind where nothing can offend
It's being able to smile, and able to laugh
Not just trying to raise our Success graph
We can't measure joy in dollar and pound
Happy is he who peace has found
Though we may fly the world around
We may be miserable on the ground
Success is not Happiness, this Truth we must know
We may have everything, what's the use of this show?
The truly successful one is he
Who lives with smile, laughter, and glee
If one is Happy, then one has achieved all
One doesn't have to be rich and in fame be tall
One can have little, but if content is he
Then he can live joyously
Achievement gives Happiness, this fact we know
But with Fulfilment and Contentment, does Happiness grow
One who is Happy, doesn't need to win
He has Peace and Joy without committing sin
Joy doesn't need a foundation of cash
One doesn't have to be rich, to enjoy life's bash
Happiness is a simple state of the mind
It comes from being loving, it comes from being Kind
Happiness is Success. It is achieving life's goal
It is being Happy in the heart, Peaceful in the Soul
True Happiness is eternal, not just a moment of joy
It last's forever, it can't be destroyed
Success is a journey of valleys and peaks
Life is a see-saw, there arelaughs and squeaks
Success, unlike Happiness, doesn't last for long
But the truly Happy ones always sing a Happy song
So, Success is not Happiness, Happiness is Success
You may be an achiever, whose heart is not at rest
But though not successful, if Happy you are
Then you are an achiever, you are the very best"

1016,Emotion,HappinessPoemsHappinessPoembyleishaarmstrong,"Happiness,
when people ask me where I find happiness,
I don't have an answer,
when they inquire what my happiest memories are,
I just shake my head,
I can't say I have a happiest memory,
It's not because all my memories are painful,
or unmemorable,
no,
It's because I search for happiness in tommorow,
In the wonder of a new dawn,
In the excitement of the growing light,
There's always something better,
so why wallow in what has been,
when you can bask in what is to come,
I have no idea what tommorow will bring,
But one things for sure,
I can always hope for a brighter future,
and never ending happiness."
1017,Emotion,HappinessPoemsAndAmongTheseAreLifeLibertyAndThePersuitOfHappinessPoembyEricAndrewJames,"Their judgment untrue
I cannot see
why it means so much
to torcher me
Why they cannot simply
let me go
why their hated words
seem rehearsed to flow
Maybe they've always held this deep down
maybe I was always an enemy
behind their loving frown
It doesn’t mean as much
to tell them I’m not free
nor that I didn't commit a crime
that I am not guilty
Or at least that’s what I tell myself
and maybe I am wrong
maybe though I did no action
my heart sang a guilty song
So if it makes them happy
I shall tell them how
that I did desire
any better now?
But I held my tongue
and put hands to the sky
this I will tell you
is no lie
Can you blame me for wanting?
I'm a human too
and when you really think about it
that’s what humans do
So give me your sober looks
if it helps you ease
I will stay a nomad as I was
so hate me if you please"

1019,Emotion,HappinessPoemsHappinessPoembycarimaDewan,"Happiness is when you have very few troubles and worries,
It's when you have no reason to say to someone you're 'Sorry'.
Happiness is when you have someone to love,
It's when you can have a full-fledged conversation with the God above.
Happiness is when it's a rainy day, in your eyes the flowers blossom and the sun gleams,
It's when you're almost convinced you're in a dream.
Happiness is a feeling that comes from within,
Its a fast flowing, merry and jumpy sort of rhythm.
When there's no happiness, take a second and shut your eyes,
Just imagine if there was some, what it would be like.
Imagine you're in a bright colourful garden, imagine you're in heaven,
Within  a few seconds you'll be on top of cloud seven."

I have no lover
not a friend to call
no one to address my suicide letter
I’m just sick of always felling nervous
feeling depressed
crying
I wonder would I ever be happy?
would I ever have a friend?
should I hope it will get better
the truth is
it won't
it never does
and you know what
I don't really care
because no happiness is worth this much pain
all the pain of getting there
then again how would I know I’ve never felt happiness"

Sobs of delight, greet this miracle of life

Silent conversations that leap beyond fate
A moan of delight when we soar together
When souls tenderly mingle, that hushed surrender
And that song between heartbeats
When a soulmate is near!"

Your home.
No need to climb that mountain,
No need for promised lands,
No need to climb that fence,
The shaft of light has told you,
You're sitting on a golden seat,
See,
Your Eden's.
Lying all around your feet."
1023,Emotion,HappinessPoemsHappinessOnAWintersNightPoembyCharlesChaimWax,"Snow began to fall at ten in the evening
fine cold adamantine snow.
On Atlantic I drove slowly, the streets being slippery,
looking for a lady
when I spotted Johnnie Mai
so pulled up next to her and she hopped into the car
and we drove to my apartment
where she quickly stripped
then made hot chocolate.
“This is a nice place, Bernstein,
sometimes I stay with Dempsey
he’s forty and loves me
but not my baby.”
“Mary with your mother? ” I asked.
Johnnie Mai sipped her hot chocolate slowly
in silence
eyes closed drifting into that private world
where a soul’s history tumbled forever alone
when suddenly she said, “Without
my mama I’d be dead,
also Mary.” Eyes open staring at me
then: “I guess we should do it.”
“That would be nice.”
We walked to the bed
the presence of her youthful
and powerful body affected me deeply:
My turn now to drift
as her gracious passion warped warmth
into me, so tender, almost true.
“Now me cause I’m still a woman
even though I take money.”
Later she asked, “Can I stay? ”
“OK, ” I said.
Then in the tinkling of an eye
she was asleep and I slid out of bed
walked to the window raised the blinds
to see in the distance Downstate Medical Center
shimmering in the descending crystals
where at this very moment most certainly
death shaped a soul into a snowflake.
I returned to Johnnie Mai her body still afire
and pressed close
a profound silence in the dark room
and I did nothing to disturb it."

1026,Emotion,HappinessPoemsTheHappinessPoembyJackHirschman,"There's a happiness, a joy
in one soul, that's been
buried alive in everyone
and forgotten.
It isn't your barroom joke
or tender, intimate humor
or affections of friendliness
or big, bright pun.
They're the surviving survivors
of what happened when happiness
was buried alive, when
it no longer looked out
of today's eyes, and doesn't
even manifest when one
of us dies, we just walk away
from everything, alone
with what's left of us,
going on being human beings
without being human,
without that happiness."

I want him to leave so I can wash the sheets,

Scandal, scandal, scandal, boys boys boys:
woke up this morning, no love in the bed.
You and I should meet for lunch. You can give me
advice. I sometimes feel judged. But that is from my
friends who aren't getting any.
Right now I guess I am wrapped up in the excitedness of it all.
But it is getting lonely here because most of my friends are getting
married.
One day, after all of this I will be married and happy and all that

1028,Emotion,HappinessPoemsThePursuitOfHappinessPoembyRICBASTASA,"the irony of this pursuit is this:
the more you pursue it
the more it escapes
away from your grasp
you think your hands
finally catch
happiness, and you
hold on to it
tightly like you
are a bird with claws
like an eagle holding
on to the monkey
then blood drifts
on the holy mountains
the paradox lies
not in the taking of happiness
but in giving it away
and then the magic happens
the mountains dance
the caves open
and the rivers sing
it is clear, when you take it
you simply release it
then you are happy
and the pursuit is nothing
but
in simply the giving
the patience of waiting
like a tree whose fruits
are ripe where children
climb
gather the fruits
and chew and swallow
every sweetness of
the pulp,
the fiber
juice sliding smoothly
inside innocent their throats"
1029,Emotion,HappinessPoemsMyHappinessIsPoembyErnestineNorthover,"A very frothy, cup of coffee,
My sweetheart's kiss, which is sheer bliss,
Some time for me, plus a pot of tea,
Reflexology for the feet, now that's a treat,
His hand in mine, which is divine,
Being together, whatever the weather,
A trip to town, to buy a new gown,
That welcomed smile, when I've walked a mile,
One friendship rare, that we both can share,
My wedding ring, this makes my heart sing,
A chocolate bar, when I feel under par,
A new found pet, that I have just met,
The grandchild's grin, when I come in,
My daughter's pride, when I'm by her side,
My husband's face, which I could never replace.

With a happiness attack.
I wasn't sure what it was.
So I laid quietly on my back.
When I fell asleep last night,
I didn't expect to wake up...
Not like that!
And when I opened my eyes,
I was surprised to feel so good.
So the next thing I did,
Was to thank God...
Like I should!
Unexpectedly I received my 'gift',
Delivered from God...
As only God could!
I awakened this morning,
With a happiness attack.
I wasn't sure what it was.
So I laid quietly on my back.
Making sure it was not the nightmare...
Many have become addicted to share.
And I had left staring in disbelief,
That I was not grieving with it!
And leaving it there.
On the other side of my door,
Where it was abandoned...
The day before!"

Happiness can't sell or buy.

My happiness is charities,
It is supported the people
Who cared about me?
It is also to help my mom
Recover her illness.
My happiness is my friends
At Poet's workshop
That fills up full time to
read and review poems.
My happiness is to plant
the flowers
and to spent time
for my love's ones.
It is also my love
for my great country
That gives me a freedom.
To think of the happiness,
An ordinary life and an inspiration."

And had the pieces widely scattered
To give all eyes a glimpse of it.
So, those who wish to own a share
Should not think it strain or stress
To search around, with utmost care,
Some dazzling fragments to possess.
A particle here, a particle there,
To your happy lot may fall;
Not any time, not anywhere,
can you ever find them all.
However long, however far-
Spreading your quest may be,
Too many are, too tiny are
The splinters all for you to see.
In common can you best enjoy
Whatever happiness comes your way.
With others if you share your joy,
It well may stage a longer stay.
Give your neighbour just a half
And see your pleasure growig double:
Make your neighbour smile or laugh;
You yourself with glee will bubble."
1036,Emotion,HappinessPoemsHappinessPoembyLouiseGluck,"A man and a woman lie on a white bed.
It is morning. I think
Soon they will waken.
On the bedside table is a vase
of lilies; sunlight
pools in their throats.
I watch him turn to her
as though to speak her name
but silently, deep in her mouth--
At the window ledge,
once, twice,
a bird calls.
And then she stirs; her body
fills with his breath.
I open my eyes; you are watching me.
Almost over this room
the sun is gliding.
Look at your face, you say,
holding your own close to me
to make a mirror.
How calm you are. And the burning wheel
passes gently over us."
1037,Emotion,HappinessPoemsTheSadStoryOfHappinessPoembyMichaelShepherd,"Statistics tell.  You can be
independent of them, but
you cannot deny them.
Though white Americans are freed
from many of the hassles and indignities
that affect black Americans, yet,
on average, they are only
very slightly happier.
Men have more power and freedom
than women, yet, on average,
they are not any happier.
(Women experience more depression,
but also more intense joy..)
Though the young have so much more
to look forward to, than the elderly,
yet ratings of life satisfaction rise slightly
up to age sixty-five, and for some, beyond..
People in colder areas of the USA
might expect Californians to be
happier. They are wrong.
Surely people who are more attractive
are happier than the unattractive?
Not so..
If you’re adequately housed,
adequately clothed, adequately fed,
then wealth will surely bring you greater happiness?
The rich are only a very little
happier than the middle classes…
So is this the end of
The American Dream – Joe,
José, Leroy, Yusuf, Gianni, Johan, Boris, Ivan, Ravi?
isn’t there a happy ending, over the border,
over the ocean, over the rainbow?
Yes, there is…
happy people grow rich faster..

waiting to burst forth from me,
happiness.
To live in such splendour and
bathe in the milky sunlight,
I wish such a happiness,

To live in a world of anger,

Hatred fills my heart,

Why can't this happiness be mine?"
1039,Emotion,HappinessPoemsOrgasmsAndHappinessPoembyByronHeadrick,"Honey, wanna fly
Take a walk upon the steel rails – slide
Skidding, three-sixties the world turns below
Into fear.  Wanna take a dive
Into Heaven or Hell?  She sees her mother’s
Pictures of that sweet baby girl that
She recognizes much to well.  Decides.
It’s alright.  Someone cares.
She turns to leave,
But trips.
Honey, wanna drive
Into a brick back alley wall
Just after she scores and
Takes control.  Woman your
Nose bleeds every time you
Contemplate love.  She worries
About kissing the arms of
The world good-bye.  Got to make
Things better.
Honey, wanna run in the night
Broken bikes and running thoughts
Woman goes insane upon misspelling
Her new last name.  Woman needs
To listen to the good ole rock-n-roll.
Sometimes I ain’t strong enough she
Sometimes knows, but never
Let’s me know what dark
Things lay covered in her
Mind’s shadows.
Honey, wanna cry
Feel a fool at a busted garden gate.
It’s no secreat that dandelions die
And friends always need your help.
Why?  Why do we shine like comets
Across the night sky – only to die.  Wanna
Drink a gallon of pesticide and write
Poetry about the experience
“It’ll be alright, ” momma always said, “It’ll be alright.”
Honey wanna skip rocks
Across the sea when the waves ain’t
High.  Woman falls ripping
Her dress as the universe explodes.
She knows there’s allot of things
That need changed about her life.
Wanna change her hair – paint it black
Cut it short like a boy’s,
But no one would notice.  She thinks twice.
Honey, wanna spit
In every man’s eye.
Later decides
It’s better to lie
And just fake
Orgasms and Happiness."
1040,Emotion,HappinessPoemsHappinessAndVisionPoembyJohannWolfgangvonGoethe,"TOGETHER at the altar we
In vision oft were seen by thee,
Thyself as bride, as bridegroom I.
Oft from thy mouth full many a kiss
In an unguarded hour of bliss
I then would steal, while none were by.
The purest rapture we then knew,
The joy those happy hours gave too,
When tasted, fled, as time fleets on.
What now avails my joy to me?
Like dreams the warmest kisses flee,
Like kisses, soon all joys are gone."
1041,Emotion,HappinessPoemsThisMomentOfHappinessPoembywilliammae,"If happiness only lies
In a place we don't exist
And only future days
Are one’s we miss
If satisfaction never comes
And dreams are unattained
Then you sacrificed your happiness
And only you’re to blame
The moment that we’re living
Should be lived with no regret
Don't let reaching for the future
Have you to obsessed
Find happiness
While you have your health
The evidence from pleasing others is
You may not please yourself"

Flames of pain have entirely

Darkness of sorrow has

1044,Emotion,HappinessPoemsHappinessPoembyMamtaAgarwal,"I am no Christ, Buddha or Gandhi
Or a wandering fakir or sanyasi.
I am an ordinary human being,
If someone slaps me
I cannot turn the other cheek.
I don't think it makes me weak.
I find it difficult to walk
On the eight fold path.
I have no lofty mission
To free mankind of suffering.
If I can make one person smile,
It makes me feel satisfied.
For I can not spread happiness and cheer,
If I am miserable and full of fear.
I cannot be totally selfless,
And efface my identity.
I owe it to myself to love me,
I don’t care if others feel
I am selfish.
Happiness is not something
You can achieve
Merely for the asking.
With experience you will find
It is a state of mind,
You attain when you make peace
With what is.
Once the awareness comes,
You are no longer feverish and
Others naturally feel comfort
In your company."
1045,Emotion,HappinessPoemsHappinessPoembyColinIanJeffery,"Happiness is elusive like the wind
Coming and going like migrating birds
And sound of echoing peals of church bells.
I would keep love safe and strong
Held fast within my heart
Never lost to furies of a purple storm.
Once, I was happy and royal with my lover
Not knowing it was supreme
And through folly have lost all to loneliness."

I am grateful to you for making me happy through out my life
I have never known love until I met you and your love touched
my heart and brought so much happiness in me
Today, you made me to see everything in a new life and you
want me to know how those happiness could make me happy
I found my happiness is to love you and to be loved from you
Sometime, I miss you so much and your absence is very painful
But when I carry your heart within me then my happiness is shining
When I am sad then your sweet words brings me happiness
and my soul get enough strength when it join your heart
When my heart wants to know the meaning of ' love'
then your love is making me to believe the truth of love
Without you there is no happiness in my life and with you
my life is full of hopes and my dream will come true
When you hold me in your arms then my heart
never want to let me go because your happiness is
my happiness. I love you so much my love."
1048,Emotion,HappinessPoemsInnermostHappinessPoembyErnestineNorthover,"Let's go find that great blue yonder,
Far away from noise and rush,
A place where one can sit and ponder,
Silently, in a cocoon of hush.
With solitude, to rest one's senses,
Some time to grasp what life's about,
To knock down all those rigid fences,
And let your wildest thoughts fly out.
Allow for all your hopes to wander,
Into dreams that calm the mind,
And use the time in that great blue yonder,
Your innermost happiness to find.

1051,Emotion,HappinessPoemsHappinessPoembyBrianTaylor,"The great stone Hall is silent
that is now millennia old.
Through the western windows
shines a glorious sun.
It floods the walls and floors,
the tables, chairs and doors,
panelling, pictures, artefacts
and illumines every one
until the wraiths that gather
cry out in their joy,
'Everything is gold!
Whatever is, is gold! '
A majestic cloud
emerges from the southern sea,
slides across the western sky
blotting out the sun.
Light through those western windows
pales to a thin grey day.
It dims the walls and floors,
the tables, chairs and doors,
panelling, pictures, artefacts
pales every one
until the wraiths in the shadows
cry out in dismay,
'Gone is gold, the gold is gone!
All joy has passed away! '"
1052,Emotion,HappinessPoemsHappinessPoembyLuciLoughlin,"Happiness is that which everyone longs
but so few of us actually get
Happiness is that which rights all wrongs
and leaves us without regret
Why then does happiness torture us so
when all we want is to feel
what happiness does in the lowest of low
when everything just seems too real
Happiness comes to so many of you
you who think it will always be there
Happiness leaves you without the clue
that living without is a nightmare
If happiness could be passed on
would you then give it to me
Will you then cry when it is gone
and realise what it is to feel lonely

This heart can hold no happiness.
The love just falls right through."
1054,Emotion,HappinessPoemsSonnetContentmentIsTheCoreToHappinessPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"Buying a car today would be so nice!
Having a car thats old is quite alright;
Getting a car tomorrow would be wise!
Changing a car each day would not be right.
Having something thats old is good enough;
Having something today seems still better;
Having something tomorrow is quite tough;
Yet, satisfaction's prime that must matter.
Each thing in time has its advantages;
Postponement's not something you always do;
One shouldn't decide slowly or take ages;
All things have demerits and beauty too!
Yet, values old have stood the test of time!
And modern things don't make life more sublime!"
1055,Emotion,HappinessPoemsHappinessPoembyThandekaBest,"What's happiness really?
A smile or a laugh,

1056,Emotion,HappinessPoemsWarpedHappinessPoembyUriahHamilton,"Cut skin,
Matching Tattoos,
Alluring night,
Tantalizing moon,
Friends were on drugs
Sauntering down
The summer avenues,
Hands clasped tightly
By romantic youths
With sexual aspirations!
We made promises
To each other
Amid the madness
To remain
Tragically in love
And never change,
I wish we would have died
Back then
In our warped happiness."

and there is no-one here to tell me,
no-one to dictate,
no-one to irritate,
to  play me around,
I'm so free,
and I'm finally...

1058,Emotion,HappinessPoemsHappinessPoembyIndiraRenganathan,"Who does not like
Red of dawn, bed of sky
Spring of sun, strings of rain
Twinkling night, lulling sleep..?
Who does not like
Pile of flowers, smile of hills
Vale of woods, scales of serene
Sail, rail, so so trial..?
Who does not like
Babes and pets, cuisine and convene
Passion for fashion, fantasy-fascination
Style, mode, flair..?
Who does not like
Wealth and health, dwelling and long living
Kith and kin, friends and folks
Family, phratry, pedigree..?
Who does not like
Felicity, beatitude, spirit and service
Loving infirm, disabled, abandoned and complacency"
1059,Emotion,HappinessPoemsHappiness20PoembyUriahHamilton,"I’ve never thought
In terms of happiness,
It always seemed
More mythic than Zeus
And less obtainable
Than gold and other precious stones.
I do what I have to do to survive,
I try to show kindness to strangers,
Apologize when I hurt someone,
Never relish in an enemy’s demise,
And never take anything
That isn’t rightfully mine.
What I’ve missed in happiness
Will be returned in the perfumed breeze
Of spring flowers
That God will waft to me
When I lie down in eternal sleep."
1060,Emotion,HappinessPoemsHappinessPoembyWilfredOwen,"Ever again to breathe pure happiness,
So happy that we gave away our toy?
We smiled at nothings, needing no caress?
Have we not laughed too often since with Joy?
Have we not stolen too strange and sorrowful wrongs
For her hands' pardoning? The sun may cleanse,
And time, and starlight. Life will sing great songs,
And gods will show us pleasures more than men's.
Yet heaven looks smaller than the old doll's-home,
No nestling place is left in bluebell bloom,
And the wide arms of trees have lost their scope.
The former happiness is unreturning:
Boys' griefs are not so grievous as our yearning,
Boys have no sadness sadder than our hope."
1061,Emotion,HappinessPoemsTrueHappinessPoembyGabriellDavis,"The warmth of the sun,
The touch of your hand,
The waves against my feet,
This is true happiness.
My father’s smile,
My mother’s laughter,
My brother’s love,
This is true happiness.
Making you laugh,
Making you smile,
Making you see that there’s more to me,
This is true happiness.
Doing this,
Writing,
Feeling, emoting,
This is true happiness.
Dancing, but not only dancing,
Giving it my whole, my being,
Becoming the dance,
This is true happiness.
Seeing your face when you realize
That I’m always me, with or without you.
Me realizing that I don’t need you.
This is true happiness."
1062,Emotion,HappinessPoemsBehindTheDoorOfHappinessPoembyBettyYeh,"Behind the door of happiness hides a frown,
who’s always afraid to come out.
She’s afraid to show herself to everyone,
so she always lets a smile out.
No matter how sad or deeply hurt,
she pretends as if there’s nothing wrong.
So she always put her smile on,
to prove that she is strong.
But when she couldn’t bare the pain no more,
the smile’s no where to be found.
The frown finally came out of the door,
but no comfort was around.
Rainy springs and long hard winters,
was like autumn’s cold windy breeze.
Throughout the year and into the summer,
she was never truly pleased.
Behind the door of happiness hides a frown,
who’s always afraid to come out.
She’s afraid to show herself to everyone,
so she always lets a smile out."

me what is happiness.
And I went to famous executives who boss the work of

I was trying to fool with them

And I saw a crowd of Hungarians under the trees with
their women and children and a keg of beer and an
accordion."

Never more to roam.
I am up beyond white clouds
Because Heaven is my home.
All my life I have waited
To be where you are,
I am here with the music
And my faithful guitar.

The roses were red
When I entered herein
Like a sheep I was led.
But I'll live here forever
With the ones I adore,
I am here with the music
Through Heaven's open door.

1066,Emotion,HappinessPoemsHappinessPoembyGreenPeace,"What is happiness without any pain?
What is happiness without any gain?
Happiness is contentment.
Happiness may also be a wonderful achievement.
Happiness can be defined as satisfaction
Which we get after doing a noble action.
Happiness can be achieved by doing selfless deeds.
By this we can sow the 'Humanity seeds'
Love one another as I have loved you,
Follow this golden principle and you will find,
Happiness awaiting you with arms
open and welcoming you."

1068,Emotion,HappinessPoemsHappinessReconsideredPoembyJudithViorst,"Happiness
Is a clean bill of health from the doctor,
And the kids shouldn't move back home for
more than a year,
And not being audited, overdrawn, in Wilkes-Barre,
in a lawsuit or in traction.
Happiness
Is falling asleep without Valium,
And having two breasts to put in my brassiere,
And not (yet) needing to get my blood pressure lowered,
my eyelids raised or a second opinion.
And on Saturday nights
When my husband and I have rented
Something with Fred Astaire for the VCR,
And we're sitting around in our robes discussing,
The state of the world, back exercises, our Keoghs,
And whether to fix the transmission or buy a new car,
And we're eating a pint of rum-raisin ice cream
on the grounds that
Tomorrow we're starting a diet of fish, fruit and grain,
And my dad's in Miami dating a very nice widow,
And no one we love is in serious trouble or pain,
And our bringing-up-baby days are far behind us,
But our senior-citizen days have not begun,
It's not what I called happiness
When I was twenty-one,
But it's turning out to be
What happiness is."

1072,Emotion,HappinessPoemsSheOfTheHeavenlyHappinessPoembyMichaelShepherd,"No-one knew what subsequently became of her
after he went so dramatically, and after all those goings-on.
He got all the headlines.
The police didn't even bother
to take her in for questioning.
There was talk of riots,
they needed every spare man.
But the story never quite went away.
You know how it is with journalists -
we file it away for a rainy day,
then it sticks in our mind
for when we retire and write a best-seller, I wish...
I doubt we'll ever know the truth of it;
but every now and then
some nutter with a convincing sighting
makes a free gift to journalists
with no personal responsibility for us either.
France, Spain, Italy, gipsy communities -
you name it, they know her
except she was never there that day.
The story among her friends is
that she went on a long Mediterranean cruise
with two other ladies.
Yet there's no account of their returning
and there are stories that they all separated
and took up new careers in foreign places
where they acquired new names, locally
so the trail's gone cold.
But stories like his, and hers,
and whether they - well, you know -
never quite go away
and the part she played
though brief, sure was dramatic, so
it's made her a role model for those women -
and there have been many over the years -
whose lives have taken a turn for the worse
(no man can know what it's like
for a woman to hav e to sell herself)
and who see in her story
a hope of life's big U-turn
and all that we really hope for.
God knows we all need one.
Could be a Lloyd-Webber musical,
come to think of it.
After all, she was there
at one of the world's big events
- that most of the media
strangely missed...
Maddalena - it's a beautiful name
in Italian.
And then there's that delicate cake
that Proust dipped in his tea.
There's a place in Italy
where they take her story very seriously,
because some local writer
turned it into a classic of hope for the socially rejected;
a rather 19th century theme.
The critics panned it;  but does it matter
whether it's truth or fiction,
if it goes so deep, that it's true in a different sort of way?
It's called 'Maddalena of the Heavenly Happiness';
it sounds better in  Italian.
no, it never got translated into English -
it's rather
Catholic
if you know what I mean.
Though it actually took place
in the Near East
or whatever it was called then."
1073,Emotion,HappinessPoemsALittleBitOfHappinessPoembyKailyndMcGregor,"Photographs capture memories
Good and bad alike
Sad times and happy times
They capture the emotion
Mom, leaning into Dad
Smiling, with presents in her hands
Her bright-red hair, blending with Dad's
As she sits in her Pooh Bear sweatshirt
Dad sits there, smiling,
In my favorite plaid, green shirt,
Reading the newspaper
It's Christmas Eve down in the basement
They sit on the blue-striped sofa,
Sitting close together
They smile as I take the photo
The last little bit of happiness
Mom and Dad were happy then,
But they're not anymore
They don't talk, smile, or even hug
They hardly show emotion
It takes its toll on my family
Last night Dad called me, crying
I love my mom and I love my dad,
But I don't think I can choose
I'll always have this photo, though,
To remind me of back then-
Back when they were happy
When I had that camera in my hand."

The sun was in her golden hair she said good day to me
A happy smile lit up her face and warmth in her friendly hi
And all around the sunlit park she spread her gift of joy.
A woman happy in herself and of care she did seem free
The brighter and happier side of life her type can only see
A woman with a cheery smile and warmth in her hello
She will spread her gift of happiness where ever she will go.
The lories and rosellas chirped on the trees and white backed magpie sung
And there was warmth in the breeze and the day was fresh and young
As she walked on down the pathway the one with the inner glow
And the brightness that is in her soul in her body language show.
I was feeling in a neutral mood not happy or not sad
Not feeling sorry for myself or angry with the World my life is not so bad
Till a young woman with a cheerful smile greeted me with a good day
And she spread her gift of happiness as she walked upon her way."

in decades and centuries
in villages and cities
by simple folks and sages.
It's within the festival of lights
in Hanukkah of the Jews,
in Tihar or Diwali of the Hindus,
in Eid of the Muslims and
in Christmas of the Christians.
The secret of giving and sharing
is upheld, valued and celebrated.
Give happiness to others
and receive bountiful
happiness as blessing

1077,Emotion,HappinessPoemsHeartbreakOrHappinessPoembyJeanetteMatthews,"Should I wait for you to fall in love with me
Or should I just forget about it and let it be
I don't want to wait for heartbreak
Because you and I both know this is something I can't take
I know that you are in love with someone else
And I don't want to be in a relationship all by myself
I want to understand your decision about us
So don't be in a relationship that you can't trust
You will always have a place in my heart
A special designed place from the start
Maybe one day we can connect
That's if our love don't reject
I feel beautiful and I hope you do too
So in the future one of us will have to say I love you
Now is not the time
So be like me and change your mind
I hope that you find happiness too
But it's a choice up to you
It was either heartbreak or happiness
And happiness was something that I didn't want to miss"
1078,Emotion,HappinessPoemsHappinessPoembyLizBennett,"Happiness eludes me.
I chase after it in firsts, highs, greats, excellents.
Puff…it vanishes. It is fractions
Of seconds, tiny, invisible, gone.
I find it in compliments, smiles, laughs;
There it goes again.
I find it in love, the fractions
Are endless, it seems, repeated
So often that I think I have found it. For good.
No. It escapes again.
Every day I am gathering fractions,
Words, smiles, laughs, compliments,
Firsts, highs, greats, excellents,
Fractions, all fractions, they become smaller
And smaller, and I am left stranded.
Brave new world, show me your face,
Show me a new me.
Without the greats, the highs, the firsts,
Show me happiness."
1079,Emotion,HappinessPoemshappinessBorrowedPoembyVidyadharDurgekar,"Confused tired and weary,
Like white clouds above,
Drifting in an untold story;
Night’s desire wrapped in cove,
With arms not lonely though;
Waiting for happy tomorrow,
To bring a passion to fend,
And not to drift in old sorrow,
Hoping to bring an end,
With the happiness borrowed;"
1080,Emotion,HappinessPoemsHappinessPoembyNeseanCoombs,"Happiness is th smile that appears when your love walks through the door
It's the fact that everyday you love her even more
Happiness is smiling when nothing goes your way
Happiness is family when you've had a tired day
Where do you find happiness do you look up or down?
You find it in the mirror at the absence of a frown
Happiness can be described in so many different ways
So let's just hope when it finally comes it will never go away"
1081,Emotion,HappinessPoemsHappinessIsNotComfortsPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"‘Does Happiness depend upon comfort? ’
The answer is definitely a big, ‘No! ’
Happiness lies in not comforts alone!
Happiness is not a static quality of the human mind, body and soul.
All can’t remain happy all the time.
It would be foolishness to wish for a life, filled with happiness alone;
Happiness is more when woes come in-between.
Happiness is just a feeling weird!
Life could become boring and monotonous, when happiness is prolonged.
Even the pauper can be happier than the prince.
Even the beggar smiles and sleeps well, despite much strife.
Happiness is a frame of mind that’s dynamic in nature;
Happiness is a kind of mood of feeling very well;
Happiness is a state of one, when life seems worth living;
Happiness is something strange that varies with time, experience and wisdom.
Happiness is all within;
Happiness is in giving;
Happiness is in sharing;
Happiness is the ceiling, whatever you fix!
Happiness does not wholly depend on comforts;
Happiness cannot be bought by money;
Happiness is not all luxury;
Happiness is abstract to the core!
Happiness is in being child-like, though adult;
Happiness is in making and seeing the less fortunate ones, smile;
Happiness is in acting adult-like, although a child
Happiness is in giving something to someone, although you still need it.
Happiness is in sacrificing for others’ sake;
Happiness is in giving up your chance to someone, who most needs it;
Happiness is in doing acts of charity;
Happiness is when you’ve led a righteous life.
Happiness to some is in dreams alone;
Happiness to some doing risky feats;
Happiness to a few is in a sheer lazy life;
Happiness to some is in yeoman service to mankind.
Happiness is a phenomenon;
Happiness is a quirk of fate;
Happiness is quite rare and scarce at times;
Happiness to some is in living in a virtual world!
Happiness is in braving the storms of life;
Happiness is in toiling for others’ sakes;
Happiness is in sharing your talents and ken;
Happiness is in loving your poor brethren.

1082,Emotion,HappinessPoemsHappinessPoembyStevieSmith,"Happiness is silent, or speaks equivocally for friends,
Grief is explicit and her song never ends,
Happiness is like England, and will not state a case,
Grief, like Guilt, rushes in and talks apace."
1083,Emotion,HappinessPoemsMyHappinessPoembylorissacowan,"I walk in the rain,
As I think about you,
Tears fall down,
As I remember what you said,
Love is a way of life,
Love is a way of heart,
Love is a part of you and me,
It’s a part of everyone,
I walk around,
Thinking of you,
As my heart is breaking,
And bleeding from the lies you told,
The blood is dripping,
Down my clothes,
It turned my shirt from red to black,
I remember what you said,
As your screaming and yelling at me,
I never really loved you,
I really only used you,
I never wanted you,
I really only HATE you!
I slice my wrist I wanted it to end,
The blood drips on the ground,
Rain starts to fall,
The ground around me turns red."
1084,Emotion,HappinessPoemsAPlaceCalledHappinessPoembyCHARMAINESIMPSON,"Hypnotic beats
Melodic rhythms
Close your eyes
Listen and hear
Explore the gift of your senses
Open the door to the power they contain
I want to show you a place where time stands still?
Where there are no rules or room for judgment
In this space that thrives on unique self expression
Maybe you have been to this amazing wonderland?
Take my hand - hold it softly in yours
Devote your soul to the joy that is music
Let the warming melody swirl and dance
Allow your mind to absorb beautiful sounds
Now open your eyes – and open your ears
We are here –
We are not alone in this dream
Look around with a perception now so bright and clear
Friendly smiles kindly greet us with acceptance
Priceless emotions soak up every inch of space
Do you feel the bliss that I feel?
Are you able to hear the gift of sound in the music?
Can you see with a vision of peace and tranquility?
I look into your eyes glistening like shining glass
Your smile glowing with radiance from within
The hug we shared held the warmth of a close friend
Silently but quite clearly your answer is evident
Welcome to happiness."
1085,Emotion,HappinessPoemsHappinessPoembyFarooqHussain,"Like a baby borne, sun rises up everyday
With the same spirit, strength
Same light being surrounded
By dew it only gives happiness
People today have forgotten
To realize, true essence
Of this talking nature,
Only speaks the truth!
Says it louder
But we, going away
Ignore it, putting it to an end
To the signal that’s yelling
Happiness is within
Find it inside, not anywhere
In nature’s lap
Nowhere else
Chirping birds, crocking frogs
Newly born day
And its aroma
All is for free
Just need is it to get it
Get it on time
It is omnipresent
Happiness is all over"
1086,Emotion,HappinessPoemsHappinessPoembySulaimanMohdYusof,"I never had this kind of amount before
Twenty hundred dollars of salary
My first job at the department store
After completed my studies at Baltimore
I am so happy to spend my money
With my family and more
With all my pals and a girl named Mandy
Celebration of joy before I walk out of the door
To further my studies in the Varsity
Everybody were so happy for me
Seeing me happy
One afternoon, I received a call from Mommy
Telling me I’ve been offered Psychology
At Michigan State University
I was so happy
My dreams would become a reality
Rockefeller is working in New York City
Upper Manhattan is the place of duty
Residing in Hoboken Avenue in New Jersey
Made him crossing the Hudson Bay daily
One day, while refueling his gas at Holland Tunnel
He met a woman named McConnell
Music from the station was playing a love song from the Beetles
She was smiling at him and hope that smiles could be eternal
Guess what?
That meeting was actually ending in a marriage
They’ve succeeded in crossing the bridge
The bridge of love and serenity
They were living happily
Form New Jersey to New York City
Is the distance to be
George Bush was feeling so happy
To be back in the White House eventually
The crucial votes in Florida
Had distant him from Al Gore and his brouhaha
It was a history
Was he really happy
Deep inside only he knows the story
As well as the first lady"

1088,Emotion,HappinessPoemsHappinessPoembyGwendlynHeleenFairfax,"To hear your smiles
To feel your joy
Your warm hearted laughter
spilling across my shoulder
Tender hands creating soft sighs
Then turning to see the light of the sky
as it bends to touch your eyes
Knowing you is a special happiness
A small child's hugging arm at my hip
The glistening shine on its plump lower lip,
quickly moistened after a delectable treat
Then the blush of color on the full
rounded cheek
This is a moment of happiness
A quiet night of deep restful sleep.
The wake to the languid, tingling, feeling, of reach
for arms that continue to keep on running to encircle one another
Yet open wide to welcome each others feats
This is the ultimate happiness"
1089,Emotion,HappinessPoemsAnEthicalIdealTheHappinessOfOthersIsMyHappinessPoembyShalomFreedman,"The happiness of others is my happiness-
Their sadness is my sadness-

Helps make me real to myself."
1090,Emotion,HappinessPoems963PeaceNHappinessWishPoembyAmitBiswas,"Love is so beautiful,
In love there is loss,
Life is still beautiful,
Do not cause loss,
If it occurs to you,
Just accept it.
None causes loss,
It just happens,
Forgive those,
Who appear to have,
Caused loss to you,
Forgiveness is noble.
Let her be happy,
And at peace,
If she could not,
She would have a reason,
Let god take care of her,
Wish her happiness and peace."
1091,Emotion,HappinessPoemsTrueHappinessPoembyMahfoozAli,"Happiness is knowing,
that you are truly loved,
But that someone special.
Knowing that you are secure,
With the person you are,
Is also happiness.
Happiness is knowing,
that you have learned,
to believe, trust and most of all,
Love yourself, for the person that you are.
Having accomplished all that is needed,
to be a complete person on the inside,
Only then, can we be truly happy.
Being happy with ourselves,
We are ready to accept the happiness,
that awaits us in our lifetime,
And that is the greatest happiness of all."

One fine day.
Submitted by Britton"
1093,Emotion,HappinessPoemsHappinessPoembyJaneKenyon,"There's just no accounting for happiness,
or the way it turns up like a prodigal
who comes back to the dust at your feet
having squandered a fortune far away.
And how can you not forgive?
You make a feast in honor of what
was lost, and take from its place the finest
garment, which you saved for an occasion
you could not imagine, and you weep night and day
to know that you were not abandoned,
that happiness saved its most extreme form
for you alone.
No, happiness is the uncle you never
knew about, who flies a single-engine plane
onto the grassy landing strip, hitchhikes
into town, and inquires at every door
until he finds you asleep midafternoon
as you so often are during the unmerciful
hours of your despair.
It comes to the monk in his cell.
It comes to the woman sweeping the street
with a birch broom, to the child
whose mother has passed out from drink.
It comes to the lover, to the dog chewing
a sock, to the pusher, to the basket maker,
and to the clerk stacking cans of carrots
in the night.
It even comes to the boulder
in the perpetual shade of pine barrens,
to rain falling on the open sea,
to the wineglass, weary of holding wine."

In my Old Age
A great Happiness
Comes over me.
Why?
I cannot exactly say
I walk I sing
Music and Poetry in me.
The Spring
The Light the Flowers
Some Great Peace
Of all the years I have been
My children
My step-grandchildren
So much I love
Eretz Yisrael.
How happy the light
Of this green day
All the while
Forgetting
The fears of what might be
The uncertainy of what is
The pains of what will be-
A great Happiness
A great Happiness
Thank G-d I have here now still
Thank God for so much goodness in my life."
1095,Emotion,HappinessPoemsMazeOfHappinessPoembyJoeyNissen,"Happiness
Can only be found
If you search for it
Like a vicious blood hound
Happiness
Is just like love
Just to get it
You will push and shove
Happiness
Is just a door
You open it up
And you just want more
Happiness
Grows like trees
It gets really big
But dies in a breeze
Happiness
Is what I could never find
So I went to the dark
To sit and hide"
1096,Emotion,HappinessPoemsHappinessIsYouLovingMePoembyShellyPrice,"There's a certain kind of magic,
that exists within your eyes.
It's there I can see what I mean to you…
It's there you loose your disguise.
There's something in your movements,
so assured, so strong and true.
It's no wonder there are entire days,
when I can think of only you.
There is a certain moment,
it happens right before we kiss…
it's a moment filled with splendor…
followed by a moment filled with bliss.
There is a magical tingle,
when ever you touch my skin.
The same way you touch my spirit,
which warms me from within.
There's something in your face,
I see it often in your stare.
It's your patient understanding,
that makes me always want you near.
There's a calmness in your hug,
and a peace that echo's your voice.
There's singing in your laughter,
that makes my heart rejoice.
There are moments when I wonder,
why destiny chose you for me.
At times I feel it's so I can learn,
to be the person I'm supposed to be.
I can't explain the things I see…
what I know and sense and feel.
But I can explain what's in my heart…
it's a love that's pure and real.
Treasure's are meant to be found,
by the lucky ones picked by fate.
I must be one of the luckiest around,
to have deserved you for my mate.
Together as a team we're invincible.
I just wish I could make you see.
That love is the answer for true happiness…
True happiness is…you loving me.
To E.M. My one and only...I Love You

A love that's good and true;
A home to care for tenderly;
A song to sing that's new
Sweet dreams and happy memories
And friends to join in mirth
Some tears to give to those who die,
And smiles to greet each birth.
Sweet dreams and happy memories,
To win a game or two.
The faith to know that Spring will come,
The strength to wait it through.
Sweet dreams and happy memories,
To do what there's to do
For joy is living day to day,
To make sweet dreams come true."

1100,Emotion,HappyPoems2AHappyFamilyPoembyGaryMcPhail,"There was me,
my brothers; a total of three,
A step-dad who was my mothers husband to be,
Each one loving each other
As we waited for a sister after being concieved,
Just recently we had bought a camera,
We stocked up on VHS tapes,
So many laughs and so much anger,
When living room boxing went on so late.
I remember a day out
The zoo is where we went
The goat ate my bag instead of the food
And tried to eat my coat through the fence.
Me and my brothers never got along
But what brothers do
We punched and shouted until we'd hurt,
But looked out for each other to,
My eldest was always grounded
coz he was a rebel on the streets,
He'd get his opinion across,
But was grounded by six,
The other was a follower, he'd follow the eldest,
The eldest became annoyed, and once again got grounded.
I tried being like my brothers,
but I never could, The youngest was a baby,
I preferred to be good,
My step dad taught me alot about respect
I listened as I should,
He taught me about love
And how I should grow up
coz life isnt always good
I was close to my mother,
I didnt want to be apart,
she'd tuck me into bed
and push me on the swings in the park
she would tickle my tummy
and buy me new clothes
she would cook something yummy
and keep me warm when it was cold."
1101,Emotion,HappyPoemsTheHappyIslandsPoembyInezIsabelMaudPeacocke,"O FAR away, and far away,
The Happy Islands lie;
In bluer seas of calm than these,
Beneath a bluer sky.
The sea, a shining girdle, winds
Round cliff and cape and bay,
With flash and gleam, and there they dream,
O far and far away!
Upon a rim of sapphire sea,
As some sweet girl might lean
Her breast of snow, my Islands glow,
All exquisite and green.
The cliffs like shining ramparts rise,
The golden beaches gleam;
And thro' the hills sing silver rills,
And cataract and stream.
Bright in a mist of leaves, on height
And headland, waving high,
The flame-flowers lean, and burn between
Splendours of sea and sky.
The still, bright forests, massed and green,
Like painted woodlands glow
In shade and shine; and belts of pine
Climb up to meet the snow.
No burning drought with fevered breath,
Nor blight of bitter hail,
Blackens the yield of fruitful field,
Nor sears the flowery vale.
Ah me! my Isles! my Happy Isles!
The Isles that nurtured me;
My heart is fain to cross again
Those leagues of purple sea,—
To watch at sunset from the hills
The headlands fade in mist,
'Mid changing glows, of gold and rose
And Bloom-of-Amethyst.
I tread to-day a sunless strand
Under sad skies of grey,
But summer smiles in my fair Isles
So far and far away."
1102,Emotion,HappyPoemsIAmSoHappyIAmAgeingPoembyFrederickKambembaYamusangie,"Oh! I am so happy
I am so happy at what
It is happening to me
I am getting Old
I am Ageing
I am loosing my teeth
My hair is turning grey
For now on,
Everybody would listen to me
The entire village would sit down
Quietly and listen to what
I would have to say
Most of the evenings
The children would abandon their houses
Rush to my place
They will arrange the fire woods
Which they will bring from
Their own houses
And put fire on them
Regardless of what their parents would say
They would still come to my place
Congregate around the fire
Even if I was sleeping
They would drag me out of my house
By force so I can tell them stories
Or I can give advice
One day I did run out of tales to tell them
They insisted of hearing the story of my life
Oh I am so happy to be ageing
Even when my mouth smells
Grown up still want to come close
To me and put their ear near my mouth
Not even closing their nose
And listen to what I have to say
Everyone wants to be my grandchild
Even those who don’t live in our village
Bow in front of me
As if I was the village chief
I don’t know if life can get better than this
But I still have major problems to solve
How can I get back
My privacy that I have lost
I am not anymore able to be
By myself and I am not allow to refuse
Any food that is given to me by everybody
Every single day as if
They were in some sort of
Food giving contest
Well… Anyway…
I am still very happy to be ageing…

1103,Emotion,HappyPoemsSonnetXviHappyInSleepPoembySamuelDaniel,"Happy in sleep, waking content to languish,
Embracing clouds by night; in daytime, mourn;
All things I loath save her and mine own anguish,
Pleas'd in my hurt inured to live forlorn.
Nought do I crave but love, death, or my Lady,
Hoarse with crying mercy, mercy yet my merit;
So man vows and prayers e'er made I,
That now at length t'yield, mere pity were it.
But still the Hydra of my cares renewing,
Revives new sorrows of her fresh disdaining;
Still must I go the summer winds pursuing,
Finding no end nor period of my paining.
Wail all my life, my griefs do touch so nearly,
And thus I live, because I love her dearly."
1104,Emotion,HappyPoemsHappyTheManPoembyJohnDryden,"Happy the man, and happy he alone,
He who can call today his own:
He who, secure within, can say,
Tomorrow do thy worst, for I have lived today.
Be fair or foul or rain or shine
The joys I have possessed, in spite of fate, are mine.
Not Heaven itself upon the past has power,
But what has been, has been, and I have had my hour."
1105,Emotion,HappyPoemsAndManyHappyReturnsPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"He had just celebrated,
with kindred friends and spirits
his seventieth.
The guests now gone
and one could hear
the squeaking of his rocking chair
accompanied by birds,
who, in the tropics, sing at night
as well, it set the stage
for melancholy reminiscence
about the crossroads  he had reached
where spectators just stood,
observing him with friendly faces
and the benevolence of man.
The specialist had said  'you will be fine',
though using neutral words to intimate
that things were in control,
that modern medicine would win
with weapons like FU, his special chemo.
There was a climate that surrounded
and pampered him, as if to say
'because we like you, Jim, you'll be okay.'
And so, there was no need to fret,
to get some order into his affairs.
He looked again at the physician's card,
with  HAPPY BIRTHDAY  in fluorescent letters.
He read the text again, but searched,
in vain for what was old tradition:
Returns, the many happy ones!
It was not there, perhaps an oversight?
A shadow crossed his tired face
when from within a voice sang out,
it told him what he knew to be
the truth, that this would be his very last."
1106,Emotion,HappyPoemsHappyBirthdayPrinceLeonardPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"A limerick dedicated to HRH Prince Leonard, *    for his 79th Birthday.
A VERY  HAPPY  BIRTHDAY, DEAR  PRINCE  LEONARD! ! ! !
There once was a farmer named Leonard,
quite a thinker and very well-mannered.
When they wanted his money
he found this not funny
and quickly became PRINCE  Leonard.
And established a souvereign state,
without fuss or a lengthy debate.
as the world held its breath:
‘would he fight to the death? ’
Or default and accept his fate?
So, it quickly became quite clear
that the Prince did not recognize fear.
Although high were the stakes
he quite had what it takes
and knew that vict’ry was near.
Then they threatened to come out in force,
to destroy this disgrace at its source.
By the end of the season
they would punish his treason
and undo this unlawful divorce.
“You will cease and desist”, they declared,
and in parliament tempers flared.
“You must  lay down your weapon
lest dreadful things happen,
our country is owned, NEVER shared! ”
Yet Prince Leonard had needed no guns,
(a principle taught to his sons) .
‘twas abundantly plain
he had used his brain
to stand up to these modern day Huns.
So the stand-off continued unchanged,
with negotiations arranged.
People asked how one could
imitate Robin Hood,
(there was talk that this man was deranged) .
And the tabloids predicted defeat.
Told the man to return to his wheat.
Or this farmer of dirt
would most surely get hurt.
That this power  he’d never beat.
Well three decades have passed  at HUTT,
and its borders have never been shut.
Diplomatic relations
with many nations
are the future – and treason it’s NOT.
Now, the country called HRPP
is alive, independent and free.
Only once did it seem
an impossible dream
of a man who’s determined to be.
So what makes this story unique?
Is it showing the strong  versus weak?
For, to simply secede
-an astonishing deed-
it belongs to a different league.
Well, I’m nearing the end of this story,
of freedom and courage and glory.
Don’t you wish that you had
as much guts as this lad,
he succeeded and never was sorry.
Just some parting words and the conclusion
‘bout a place of resplendent seclusion.
Me? -I like what I see!
It’s the place to be.
And, most certainly not an illusion.
On a map it is only a sliver.
To the pollies? It makes them shiver!
But wherever you are
it never seems far:

1107,Emotion,HappyPoemsAHappyBossMakesAHappyWorksPoembyAntonioLiao,"into the unending work line comes a new beginning
of tolerance of adverse attitude, surfing the taste of
temper and luring smile
timing comes as it waits the gain that deals beyond,
human aspiration, the lasting praise gains no one.
but the soul that leads to the ground of sayonara in
the most astounding halos of goodbye
filled up the nice smile and return the forever respect
of the one who seat in the throne; the table and the
pen recite no one and see's the gratitude and the
work done even the night is gone
understand the boss, and jam what ever floats
in the air; knowing the good in the decision it gives
on your job the best goes flattered in the hand, the
whole things bless with fun
feel good, and save for a day, the fresh comes in
a wonderful awesome morning for you to stay, take
always the boss legacy, and chant the melody that
brings your pleasant moment with whom the
blessing comes in a spectacular happy day
the work is not yet over, always thank that the day
with your Boss will be a great moment to stay and
as you whisper a prayer, let this be the connecting
line of another life to spend with wisdom to live
stop, pose and confirm....... as you say Amen"
1108,Emotion,HappyPoemsAsLongAsYouReHappyPoembyLeoLopes,"Today i met a lonely girl
with a touch of magic
i've been waiting for someone like her
I'm so happy
She let's me know of her love
i give her all of mine
My Angel sent from above
i tell her all the time cause i'm so happy
Now what was once 2 lonely souls
tonight we sleep, arms in arms
i found someone to love and hold
i wonder if she's happy
Love is here, just in time
my dark world has begun to shine
wherever i go, i want her near
cause she's what makes me happy
How long will this love last?
still can't believe she's mine
So attractive with a past so tragic
i'll do anything for her just as long as she's happy
She seems to hold and kiss me less
i feel so cold, her lips are blessed
i hope she never strays from me
she's what keeps me happy
She wants to free, it's in her eyes
Away from me, let her decide
an eclipse is what she sees in mine
cause love has made me happy
Then came the day, i lost my heart
she's gone away, forever we part
I find myself back in the dark
where nobody can be happy
I would hold you in my arms
No other hand in my palms
i thought the love of ours would last
she wants me to be happy
Forget about me
life has been tragic
im'a wait in the rain for you
just to see you happy
I'm stuck in a world where demons grab me
They stab me
...but im'a wait in the rain for you
As long as you're happy"
1109,Emotion,HappyPoemsAHappyEndPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"Oh, that your lovely flesh be there for me
a thousand miles I must, on blood-stained boots
hike through the corpses of man's hate for man
and carry only one, an ever-longing thought.
A bullet on a mission with the sound of scorn
and weaving on its path of wild destruction
flies by me, humming like a goddamn bumblebee
I'm telling blistered feet to be my friends.
What if, I say with hollow trepidation
another man, yet from another land
has claimed the prize before  I stagger home,
it will not leave me and becomes its own obsession.
And then, a nightingale, sits on the knotted branch
of a tall tree that shows the ravages of war,
and sings the sweetest song that Nature could conceive
she sings for me and tells about my distant love.
It is enough to hear the sounds of this fine music
new powers penetrate my worn exhausted bones,
time is suspended altogether like a dream
and on the steps up to her door I weakly stumble
to catch the ambience of this thing called Happy End."
1110,Emotion,HappyPoemsHappyDreamsOfMurderPoembyBEAUGOLDEN,"I'll tell you what is wrong with me
I hope you will not weep
Happy dreams of marder are enchanting my nights sleep
Nothing wakes me late at night sedatives stopped all that
I wouldn't even wake up if you hit me with a bat
My dreams are filled with bloodshed the massacre won't stop
I can't restrain the pleasure i gain from spilling every drop
I've killed the guys who've pissed me off every worthless sot
Killed Franks, and Jeffs, and many Bobs, and a guy whose name was Lott
My method is machine gun as they lined up in their cue
Perhaps they are all lawyers thinking i'm the next they'll sue
Maybe the media has trained me to be
Less sensitive to my fellows humanity
Or maybe i have inherited a relatives insanity
No matter what the truth is i chalk it up to fate
It's better to marder in your sleep than dream of a face you hate
Happy dreams of marder are giving me good nights rest
Nightmares filled with violence excite my heart the best
Happy dreams of Marder are where my nights are mired
It's silly but i dream of killy
When im truly tired

1111,Emotion,HappyPoemsCharacterOfTheHappyWarriorPoembyWilliamWordsworth,".   Who is the happy Warrior? Who is he
That every man in arms should wish to be?
--It is the generous Spirit, who, when brought
Among the tasks of real life, hath wrought
Upon the plan that pleased his boyish thought:
Whose high endeavours are an inward light
That makes the path before him always bright;
Who, with a natural instinct to discern
What knowledge can perform, is diligent to learn;
Abides by this resolve, and stops not there,
But makes his moral being his prime care;
Who, doomed to go in company with Pain,
And Fear, and Bloodshed, miserable train!
Turns his necessity to glorious gain;
In face of these doth exercise a power
Which is our human nature's highest dower:
Controls them and subdues, transmutes, bereaves
Of their bad influence, and their good receives:
By objects, which might force the soul to abate
Her feeling, rendered more compassionate;
Is placable--because occasions rise
So often that demand such sacrifice;
More skilful in self-knowledge, even more pure,
As tempted more; more able to endure,
As more exposed to suffering and distress;
Thence, also, more alive to tenderness.
--'Tis he whose law is reason; who depends
Upon that law as on the best of friends;
Whence, in a state where men are tempted still
To evil for a guard against worse ill,
And what in quality or act is best
Doth seldom on a right foundation rest,
He labours good on good to fix, and owes
To virtue every triumph that he knows:
--Who, if he rise to station of command,
Rises by open means; and there will stand
On honourable terms, or else retire,
And in himself possess his own desire;
Who comprehends his trust, and to the same
Keeps faithful with a singleness of aim;
And therefore does not stoop, nor lie in wait
For wealth, or honours, or for worldly state;
Whom they must follow; on whose head must fall,
Like showers of manna, if they come at all:
Whose powers shed round him in the common strife,
Or mild concerns of ordinary life,
A constant influence, a peculiar grace;
But who, if he be called upon to face
Some awful moment to which Heaven has joined
Great issues, good or bad for human kind,
Is happy as a Lover; and attired
With sudden brightness, like a Man inspired;
And, through the heat of conflict, keeps the law
In calmness made, and sees what he foresaw;
Or if an unexpected call succeed,
Come when it will, is equal to the need:
--He who, though thus endued as with a sense
And faculty for storm and turbulence,
Is yet a Soul whose master-bias leans
To homefelt pleasures and to gentle scenes;
Sweet images! which, wheresoe'er he be,
Are at his heart; and such fidelity
It is his darling passion to approve;
More brave for this, that he hath much to love:--
'Tis, finally, the Man, who, lifted high,
Conspicuous object in a Nation's eye,
Or left unthought-of in obscurity,--
Who, with a toward or untoward lot,
Prosperous or adverse, to his wish or not--
Plays, in the many games of life, that one
Where what he most doth value must be won:
Whom neither shape or danger can dismay,
Nor thought of tender happiness betray;
Who, not content that former worth stand fast,
Looks forward, persevering to the last,
From well to better, daily self-surpast:
Who, whether praise of him must walk the earth
For ever, and to noble deeds give birth,
Or he must fall, to sleep without his fame,
And leave a dead unprofitable name--
Finds comfort in himself and in his cause;
And, while the mortal mist is gathering, draws
His breath in confidence of Heaven's applause:
This is the happy Warrior; this is he
That every man in arms should wish to be."
1112,Emotion,HappyPoemsToBeHappyPoembyAndrealPetricHuffman,"To be happy
Is to be happy with oneself.
To be happy
Is to be free with your thoughts and aspirations.
To be happy with oneself
Is to have that inner peace of mind acceptable to change,
Being able to play your part in life's forever changing game.
To be sad with life
Is to be discourage with life.
Do not be discouraged
Be encouraged
To have no cares no worries.
So be happy
Life is a colorful growing tree
Which leaves change colors everyday.
Find your color and grow your tree
To be all you can be."
1113,Emotion,HappyPoemsHappyBirthdayToddPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"Yes, He gave the nod,
to the two of you then
and he found it not odd

and he christened him Todd
and assigned him to Mary,
what was scripted by God
cannot end up contrary.
From the Down Under Land
we do send our wishes
but you must understand
that you'll still do the dishes
on this day of your birth
'cause you do have great skill
and for what it is worth
keep your house very still.
Be it known that the reason
for a man's volunteering
cannot be seen as treason
just some smart engineering.
You can see she is busy
writing great poetry
so don't be in a tizzy,
let her spirit be free.
May the day give you pleasure
and the cake a success
you do have a great treasure
and a poet no less."

Gone is an old year;
Let’s add new cheer,
Live without fear.
Greet your neighbors;
Greet some strangers;
Greet all your friends;
And make amends.
’Tis never late
To change one’s fate;
Problems abate:
Wait for that date.
Forget past woes;
Forget chaos;
With hope, of course:
Thus, our life goes.
Abide in God;
Await His nod;
Avoid His rod,
And thank the Lord.
When God's with us,
There is no curse;
Walk without fuss;
He sure will bless.

The happy life be these, I find:--
The richesse left, not got with pain;
The fruitful ground, the quiet mind;
The equal friend; no grudge, no strife;
No charge of rule, nor governance;
Without disease, the healthful life;
The household of continuance;
The mean diet, no delicate fare;
True wisdom join'd with simpleness;
The night discharged of all care,
Where wine the wit may not oppress.
The faithful wife, without debate;
Such sleeps as may beguile the night:
Contented with thine own estate
Ne wish for death, ne fear his might."
1116,Emotion,HappyPoemsTheSongOfTheHappyShepherdPoembyWilliamButlerYeats,"THE woods of Arcady are dead,
And over is their antique joy;
Of old the world on dreaming fed;
Grey Truth is now her painted toy;
Yet still she turns her restless head:
But O, sick children of the world,
Of all the many changing things
In dreary dancing past us whirled,
To the cracked tune that Chronos sings,
Words alone are certain good.
Where are now the warring kings,
Word be-mockers? -- By the Rood,
Where are now the watring kings?
An idle word is now their glory,
By the stammering schoolboy said,
Reading some entangled story:
The kings of the old time are dead;
The wandering earth herself may be
Only a sudden flaming word,
In clanging space a moment heard,
Troubling the endless reverie.
Then nowise worship dusty deeds,
Nor seek, for this is also sooth,
To hunger fiercely after truth,
Lest all thy toiling only breeds
New dreams, new dreams; there is no truth
Saving in thine own heart.  Seek, then,
No learning from the starry men,
Who follow with the optic glass
The whirling ways of stars that pass --
Seek, then, for this is also sooth,
No word of theirs -- the cold star-bane
Has cloven and rent their hearts in twain,
And dead is all their human truth.
Go gather by the humming sea
Some twisted, echo-harbouring shell.
And to its lips thy story tell,
And they thy comforters will be.
Rewording in melodious guile
Thy fretful words a little while,
Till they shall singing fade in ruth
And die a pearly brotherhood;
For words alone are certain good:
Sing, then, for this is also sooth.
I must be gone:  there is a grave
Where daffodil and lily wave,
And I would please the hapless faun,
Buried under the sleepy ground,
With mirthful songs before the dawn.
His shouting days with mirth were crowned;
And still I dream he treads the lawn,
Walking ghostly in the dew,
Pierced by my glad singing through,
My songs of old earth's dreamy youth:
But ah! she dreams not now; dream thou!
For fair are poppies on the brow:
Dream, dream, for this is also sooth."

Yon orange sunset waning slow:
From fringes of the faded eve,
O, happy planet, eastward go:
Till over thy dark shoulder glow
Thy silver sister world, and rise
To glass herself in dewey eyes
That watch me from the glen below.
Ah, bear me with thee, lightly borne,
Dip forward under starry light,
And move me to my marriage-morn,
And round again to happy night."
1120,Emotion,HappyPoemsHappyEndingsPoembysylviaspencer,"Is there always a happy ending,
to every song and a story.
Some are happy, and others weep,
and then there are those,
that finish in glory.
Is there a happy ending, to every day,
maybe not, when your filled with grief
and it's not stopped raining,
and the sky is grey.
Happy endings are made by you
it's how you  work, and go about it,
can make that ending come true..
Just be yourself, however small,
and smile when things get out of tune,
a happy ending, can be found.
Then life becomes, just one honeymoon"

To see no other verdure than its own;
To feel no other breezes than are blown
Through its tall woods with high romances blent:
Yet do I sometimes feel a languishment
For skies Italian, and an inward groan
To sit upon an Alp as on a throne,
And half forget what world or worldling meant.
Happy is England, sweet her artless daughters;
Enough their simple loveliness for me,
Enough their whitest arms in silence clinging:
Yet do I often warmly burn to see
Beauties of deeper glance, and hear their singing,
And float with them about the summer waters."

Corrode my heart like an ancient ruin
I’ll live there forever if it makes you happy

I don’t care if it makes you happy
I don’t care about myself just as long
As you’re always happy
I’ll survive all of this
As long as I know you’re always happy
Whatever makes you happy!
Whatever makes you happy!
Burn the photographs; forget about me
I’ll forget about me too, if it makes you happy
I’m so sorry if I ever hurt you
Baby you’re the only thing that makes me happy

I just miss, being happy

And I’m sorry I can’t make you happy
I just wish I could make you happy"

1125,Emotion,HappyPoemsHappyBirthdayAbramPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"In a snowy little hamlet lived a boy with a short name
he was sent to the one room school in the town.
All the letters and the numbers did at first look much the same
and the boy was often wearing a small frown.
But his mind had been well-nourished and was full of great ideas,
soon the teachers noticed something 'round the lad,
idle thoughts of how things worked and shunning smoke and hazy mirrors
he would often wonder if the world was mad.
Many years have passed and honours fluttered in through troubled skies
but large gaggles of opponents hung around,
thus for decades they were jealous and would tell those factoid lies
and when challenged they would quickly go to ground.
Yet the world does know its master in the field of Human Health
and the families of all as well as 'them'
are aware that he would putter with the science, not the wealth
as he looked at situations from the stem.
I have never in my travels met another noble man
who would fascinate so simply with his mind
and with quiet confidence he would just nod and say 'I can'
with a smile that told the world that he was kind.
Well, last night I had a dream that woke me up at 3 o-five
and the recall was according to B-six
and the gods had told me then that our man would be alive
as the gods had seen his work and how he ticks.
Then a voice came through the clouds, it was God who did the talking
there was lightning and the heavens shook and thundered
I could hear the words so clear, 'yes,  this man will still be walking
on this earth when he gets to be one hundred. '"

1128,Emotion,HappyPoemsTheHappyTownlandPoembyWilliamButlerYeats,"THERE'S many a strong farmer
Whose heart would break in two,
If he could see the townland
That we are riding to;
Boughs have their fruit and blossom
At all times of the year;
Rivers are running over
With red beer and brown beer.
An old man plays the bagpipes
In a golden and silver wood;
Queens, their eyes blue like the ice,
Are dancing in a crowd.
The little fox he murmured,
'O what of the world's bane?'
The sun was laughing sweetly,
The moon plucked at my rein;
But the little red fox murmured,
'O do not pluck at his rein,
He is riding to the townland
That is the world's bane.'
When their hearts are so high
That they would come to blows,
They unhook rheir heavy swords
From golden and silver boughs;
But all that are killed in battle
Awaken to life again.
It is lucky that their story
Is not known among men,
For O, the strong farmers
That would let the spade lie,
Their hearts would be like a cup
That somebody had drunk dry.
The little fox he murmured,
'O what of the world's bane?'
The sun was laughing sweetly,
The moon plucked at my rcin;
But the little red fox murmured,
'O do not pluck at his rein,
He is riding to the townland
That is the world's bane.'
Michael will unhook his trumpet
From a bough overhead,
And blow a little noise
When the supper has been spread.
Gabriel will come from the water
With a fish-tail, and talk
Of wonders that have happened
On wet roads where men walk.
And lift up an old horn
Of hammered silver, and drink
Till he has fallen asleep
Upon the starry brink.
The little fox he murmured,
'O what of the world's bane?'
The sun was laughing sweetly,
The moon plucked at my rein;
But the little red fox murmured.
'O do not pluck at his rein,
He is riding to the townland
That is the world's bane.'"

In the golden haze off yonder,
Where the song of the sun-kissed breeze beguiles,
And the ocean loves to wander.
Fragrant the vines that mantle those hills,
Proudly the fig rejoices;
Merrily dance the virgin rills,
Blending their myriad voices.
Our herds shall fear no evil there,
But peacefully feed and rest them;
Neither shall serpent nor prowling bear
Ever come there to molest them.
Neither shall Eurus, wanton bold,
Nor feverish drouth distress us,
But he that compasseth heat and cold
Shall temper them both to bless us.
There no vandal foot has trod,
And the pirate hosts that wander
Shall never profane the sacred sod
Of those beautiful Isles out yonder.
Never a spell shall blight our vines,
Nor Sirius blaze above us,
But you and I shall drink our wines
And sing to the loved that love us.
So come with me where Fortune smiles
And the gods invite devotion,--
Oh, come with me to the Happy Isles
In the haze of that far-off ocean!"

That serveth not another's will;
Whose armour is his honest thought,
And simple truth his highest skill;
Whose passions not his masters are;
Whose soul is still prepar'd for death
Untied unto the world with care
Of princes' grace or vulgar breath;
Who envies none whom chance doth raise,
Or vice; who never understood
The deepest wounds are given by praise,
By rule of state, but not of good;
Who hath his life from rumours freed;
Whose conscience is his strong retreat;
Whose state can neither flatterers feed,
Nor ruins make accusers great;
Who God doth late and early pray,
More of his grace than goods to send,
And entertains the harmless day
With a well-chosen book or friend.
This man is free from servile bands
Of hope to rise or fear to fall;
Lord of himself, though not of lands;
And having nothing, yet hath all."

With each birthday, you feel wiser and bright:
That success in your life is somewhat near;
You make your mind to continue your fight,
And try to live your life without much fear.
’Tis good to celebrate one more birthday;
Thank God for His kindness, protection, love;
Abide in Him and fervently do pray;
Our earthly life should markedly improve!
But never feel sadder on your birthday;
Feel proud to walk beside God in His way.

The vibe was absolutely right
The sparks were flying left and right
Jesus I was happy
We talked and talked of this and that
Nothing more than vapid chat
I don’t remember what was said
More than words were talking
On and on we went like that
Playing off and bouncing back
So rare a thing to feel like that
You made me happy
Starry eyed and laughing
As we said good night and parted
And I floated helium hearted homeward
God you made me happy
That night when I went to bed
I couldn’t sleep my buzzing head
Was wondering what would happen next
And guess what, I was happy
That was now a month ago
I’ve seen you come I’ve watched you go
I’m wondering what the future holds
And how to make you happy.
I’d shower you with lies and gifts
I’d move the earth if we could live
Together you and me like this
Great God I’m happy."

Their ceaseless sacrifice of praise.

Draw by the music of thy name,
And charm into a beauteous frame.
For this the pleading Spirit groans,
And cries in all thy banished ones;
Greatest of gifts, thy love impart,
And make us of one mind and heart.
Join every soul that looks to thee
In bonds of perfect charity;
Now, Lord, the glorious fullness give,
And all in all for ever live!"
1135,Emotion,HappyPoemsHappyTheLabRerPoembyJaneAusten,"Happy the lab'rer in his Sunday clothes!
In light-drab coat, smart waistcoat, well-darn'd hose,
Andhat upon his head, to church he goes;
As oft, with conscious pride, he downward throws
A glance upon the ample cabbage rose
That, stuck in button-hole, regales his nose,
He envies not the gayest London beaux.
In church he takes his seat among the rows,
Pays to the place the reverence he owes,
Likes best the prayers whose meaning least he knows,
Lists to the sermon in a softening doze,
And rouses joyous at the welcome close."
1136,Emotion,HappyPoemsTriggerHappyPoembyLindaHepner,"Bring back my email,
Lordy, bring it back.
I never meant to send it,
I never meant to press
That press key and I never meant
To let him see
My wildest wish, sent hurtling
Through the ether like
A comet, trailing harmful fire,
Streaking like a rocket
Whizzing and shrieking and
Exploding in the air
For all to see,
For him to see,
And now he knows
And now he knows
And yes I wanted to,
He needed it,
He must have known,
His face blanched
Like the moon."
1137,Emotion,HappyPoemsHappyBirthdayDadPoembyArfaKarim,"Every day the whole year through,
I feel grateful you are my father.
Some fathers dont have time for their kids,
But for you I am never a bother.
You always make the effort to listen and share;
You are always there when you are needed.
It warms me to know how much you care,
And with that knowledge my worries are defeated.
Dad, you are truly admired and adored,
And as your daughter, I hope that you know,
These sentiments fill me each day of the year,
And my love for you continues to grow.
Today I wish you much pleasure and joy;
I hope all of your wishes come true.
May each hour and minute be filled with delight,
And your birthday be perfect for you!"
1138,Emotion,HappyPoemsTheHappyChildPoembyWilliamHenryDavies,"I saw this day sweet flowers grow thick --
But not one like the child did pick.
I heard the packhounds in green park --
But no dog like the child heard bark.
I heard this day bird after bird --
But not one like the child has heard.
A hundred butterflies saw I --
But not one like the child saw fly.
I saw the horses roll in grass --
But no horse like the child saw pass.
My world this day has lovely been --
But not like what the child has seen."
1139,Emotion,HappyPoemsHappyBirthdayBirthdayHappyPoembyRayHansell,"Some years ago
A star was born
A beautiful girl
With a heart so warm
You grew into a woamn
A wonderful sight to see
I still get so excited
When ever you look at me
Another year has quickly passed
But you don't show your age
Its just another verse for you
To write down on a page
The book of life you're writing
Is a continuing story
The pages in your book
I'm sure are filled with glory
As your day approaches
I wanted to send you a cheer
I hope for your next birthday
I can somwhow be near
So, have a Happy Birthday
For you deserve the best
This is not just something
That I say in jest
From my heart I truly mean it
I hope your day is great
I hope my Birthday wish for you

upon your life today.
The happiness can wait
so can the candles
on the cake. They flicker
as if to tell you fibs
of optical illusion
and icing, creamy pink
and sugarsweet.
So, have a piece,
a smaller one should go
onto his China plate
across from you,
where loving eyes observe
aglow, like a contented bull
la vache qui rit, in human form
Eat up, dear Allie, he will do
all dishes of next year for you."

That feels to her—like Sacrament—

That Heaven permit so meek as her—
To such a Fate—to Minister."

Once again, it's fookin' Mother's Day!
You and I don't talk,
You're mad at me while I refuse to bawk!
I'd love to be able to call you,
To tell you, I'll always love you,
That I'm proud to be your daughter...
I'd love to have you in my life,
Let you know, I'll soon be someone's wife,
To show you what kind of woman I've become,
I have you meet the man I find most handsome.
Being your daughter, I must say it truly sadens my heart,
Our lives being so far apart.
If I was to call, I'd wind up crying
Screaming and throwing the phone up against the wall,
Guess it's a good thing there's no laws,
Or else i'd be charged for phone~slaughter!
Guilty on the first degree....
Like mother like daughter!
Hope that one day you'll see that,
Regardless of our differences
I really do love and miss you.
I still hold a special place for you in my heart,
Even though our DNA's the only thing we have in common,
Maybe next Mother's Day we wont be so far apart.
Happy Mother's Day Mom! Love you!"
1144,Emotion,HappyPoemsHowStillHowHappyPoembyEmilyJaneBrontë,"How still, how happy! Those are words
That once would scarce agree together;
I loved the plashing of the surge -
The changing heaven the breezy weather,
More than smooth seas and cloudless skies
And solemn, soothing, softened airs
That in the forest woke no sighs
And from the green spray shook no tears.
How still, how happy! now I feel
Where silence dwells is sweeter far
Than laughing mirth's most joyous swell
However pure its raptures are.
Come, sit down on this sunny stone:
'Tis wintry light o'er flowerless moors -
But sit - for we are all alone
And clear expand heaven's breathless shores.
I could think in the withered grass
Spring's budding wreaths we might discern;
The violet's eye might shyly flash
And young leaves shoot among the fern.
It is but thought - full many a night
The snow shall clothe those hills afar
And storms shall add a drearier blight
And winds shall wage a wilder war,
Before the lark may herald in
Fresh foliage twined with blossoms fair
And summer days again begin
Their glory - haloed crown to wear.
Yet my heart loves December's smile
As much as July's golden beam;
Then let us sit and watch the while
The blue ice curdling on the stream -"
1145,Emotion,HappyPoemsHymnXivHappyTheManThatFindsTheGracePoembyJohnWesley,"Happy the man that finds the grace,
The blessing of God's chosen race,
The wisdom coming from above,
The faith that sweetly works by love.
Happy beyond description he
Who knows, The Saviour died for me,
The gift unspeakable obtains,
And heavenly understanding gains.
Wisdom divine! Who tells the price
Of wisdom's costly merchandise
Wisdom to silver we prefer,
And gold is dross compared to her.
Her hands are filled with length of days,
True riches, and immortal praise,
Riches of Christ, on all bestowed,
And honour that descends from God.
To purest joys she all invites,
Chaste, holy, spiritual delights;
Her ways are ways of pleasantness,
And all her flowery paths are peace.
Happy the man who wisdom gains,
Thrice happy who his guest retains!
He owns, and shall for ever own,
Wisdom, and Christ, and heaven are one."
1146,Emotion,HappyPoemsPsalmXxxiiHappyTheManPoembyIsaacWatts,"Happy the man to whom his God
No more imputes his sin,
But, washed in the Redeemer's blood,
Hath made his garments clean.
Happy beyond expression he
Who debts are thus discharged;
And from the guilty bondage free,
He feels his soul enlarged.
His spirit hates deceit and lies,
His words are all sincere;
He guards his heart, he guards his eyes,
To keep his conscience clear.
While I my inward guilt suppressed,
No quiet could I find;
Thy wrath lay burning in my breast,
And racked my tortured mind.
Then I confessed my troubled thoughts,
My secret sins revealed;
Thy pard'ning grace forgave my faults,
Thy grace my pardon sealed.
This shall invite thy saints to pray;
When like a raging flood
Temptations rise, our strength and stay
Is a forgiving God."
1147,Emotion,HappyPoemsSonnethappyBirthdayDearFatherInLawPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"Another birthday, God has given you;
’Tis time you thought about your age and health;
God’s love and mercy in life has been true;
Your family and fortitude’s- your wealth.
’Tis time to pray extra: forget the world;
You did your part and duty indeed well;
Protect yourself from injury and cold;
Be wise: take rest and do not become ill.
Remember that you aren’t young anymore;
Your frame is frail and dangers lurk round you;
Your will-power isn’t as strong as before;
A long life-span comes only to a few.
‘Wish you a Happy Birthday, ’ dear Maama!
God be with you in your earthly drama!

1151,Emotion,HappyPoemsOhHappyDayPoembyDavidDarbyshire,"Last day of school,
going to the pool.
First day of spring.
Didn't get a bee sting.
Birth of a first born child,
weathers going to be mild.
All the home work is done,
My football team just won.
The war is over,
poppies in the clover.
Our chicken laid an egg,
Got money don't have to beg.
End of the week, it's Friday.
Girl friend got her Bouquet.
Oh Oh what a Happy Day
On holiday, goin away......
Going to be happy and free,
And Jesus Love's Me."
1152,Emotion,HappyPoemsTheHappyCouplePoembyJohannWolfgangvonGoethe,"AFTER these vernal rains
That we so warmly sought,
Dear wife, see how our plains
With blessings sweet are fraught!
We cast our distant gaze
Far in the misty blue;
Here gentle love still strays,
Here dwells still rapture true.
Thou seest whither go
Yon pair of pigeons white,
Where swelling violets blow
Round sunny foliage bright.
'Twas there we gather'd first
A nosegay as we roved;
There into flame first burst
The passion that we proved.
Yet when, with plighted troth,
The priest beheld us fare
Home from the altar both,
With many a youthful pair,--
Then other moons had birth,
And many a beauteous sun,
Then we had gain'd the earth
Whereon life's race to run.
A hundred thousand fold
The mighty bond was seal'd;
In woods, on mountains cold,
In bushes, in the field,
Within the wall, in caves,
And on the craggy height,
And love, e'en o'er the waves,
Bore in his tube the light.
Contented we remain'd,
We deem'd ourselves a pair;
'Twas otherwise ordain'd,
For, lo! a third was there;
A fourth, fifth, sixth appear'd,
And sat around our board;
And now the plants we've rear'd
High o'er our heads have soar'd!
How fair and pleasant looks,
On yonder beauteous spot,
Embraced by poplar-brooks,
The newly-finish'd cot!
Who is it there that sits
In that glad home above?
Is't not our darling Fritz
With his own darling love?
Beside yon precipice,
Whence pent-up waters steal,
And leaving the abyss,
Fall foaming through the wheel,
Though people often tell
Of millers' wives so fair,
Yet none can e'er excel
Our dearest daughter there!
Yet where the thick-set green
Stands round yon church and sad,
Where the old fir-tree's seen
Alone tow'rd heaven to nod,--
'Tis there the ashes lie
Of our untimely dead;
From earth our gaze on high
By their blest memory's led.
See how yon hill is bright
With billowy-waving arms!
The force returns, whose might
Has vanquished war's alarms.
Who proudly hastens here
With wreath-encircled brow?
'Tis like our child so dear
Thus Charles comes homeward now.
That dearest honour'd guest
Is welcom'd by the bride;
She makes the true one blest,
At the glad festal tide.
And ev'ry one makes haste
To join the dance with glee;
While thou with wreaths hast graced
The youngest children three.
To sound of flute and horn
The time appears renew'd,
When we, in love's young morn,
In the glad dance upstood;
And perfect bliss I know
Ere the year's course is run,
For to the font we go
With grandson and with son!"
1153,Emotion,HappyPoemsHowHappyIWasIfICouldForgetPoembyEmilyDickinson,"898
How happy I was if I could forget
To remember how sad I am
Would be an easy adversity
But the recollecting of Bloom
Keeps making November difficult
Till I who was almost bold
Lose my way like a little Child
And perish of the cold."

You are happy,
We are happy to be both here;
It's so lovely,
Yes so lovely,
It's summertime in the air.
When a bloom's born in spring,
See how lovely it becomes,
With your heart along sing,
Wake up from winter’s glums;
Life is growing again,
From the old that's asleep,
From the mountains to glen,
All the flowers now reap.
You will be singing in tune,
With the wonders of time,
For the blossoms of June,
Fit like a song to a rime;
When all life comes in full,
With its growth and its skills,
No moment's longer dull,
There's just song in the hills.
I am happy,
You are happy,
It's the happiest time of the year;
It's so lovely,
Yes so lovely,
When life's growing everywhere.
Time renews all our wishes,
What grows old is born anew,
After some temporary glitches,
Again earth restores its debut."

1158,Emotion,HappyPoemsHappyAsTheDayIsLongPoembyJamesTate,"I take the long walk up the staircase to my secret room.
Today's big news: they found Amelia Earhart's shoe, size 9.
1992: Charlie Christian is bebopping at Minton's in 1941.
Today, the Presidential primaries have failed us once again.
We'll look for our excitement elsewhere, in the last snow
that is falling, in tomorrow's Gospel Concert in Springfield.
It's a good day to be a cat and just sleep.
Or to read the Confessions of Saint Augustine.
Jesus called the sons of Zebedee the Sons of Thunder.
In my secret room, plans are hatched: we'll explore the Smoky Mountains.
Then we'll walk along a beach: Hallelujah!
(A letter was just delivered by Overnight Express--
it contained nothing of importance, I slept through it.)
(I guess I'm trying to be ""above the fray."")
The Russians, I know, have developed a language called ""Lincos""
designed for communicating with the inhabitants of other worlds.
That's been a waste of time, not even a postcard.
But then again, there are tree-climbing fish, called anabases.
They climb the trees out of stupidity, or so it is said.
Who am I to judge? I want to break out of here.
A bee is not strong in geometry: it cannot tell
a square from a triangle or a circle.
The locker room of my skull is full of panting egrets.
I'm saying that strictly for effect.
In time I will heal, I know this, or I believe this.
The contents and furnishings of my secret room will be labeled
and organized so thoroughly it will be a little frightening.
What I thought was infinite will turn out to be just a couple
of odds and ends, a tiny miscellany, miniature stuff, fragments
of novelties, of no great moment. But it will also be enough,
maybe even more than enough, to suggest an immense ritual and tradition.
And this makes me very happy."
1159,Emotion,HappyPoemsHappyFathersDayPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"And soon
we'll meet again,
old man.
Me, bearing flowers,
chaperoned by
one sweet niece,
'to show the ropes'
to me, the stranger.
And water things.
You, in the ground
since that cold day
in March,
with snow
still in the hills.
Your hills
where you meandered,
chased after that
psychopathic dog,
while reminiscing
over notable
advantages,
most imagined,
of long-gone days.
And of this,
the new world,
made entirely
for others.
Yet, you took pride
in always doing
your best
in any circumstance.
'Some day,
you said,
I'll be six feet under',
yeah,
and watching,
also judging,
maybe praising
surely condemning,
only the role
of executioner
to be denied.
That day did come.
You were prepared
of course.
The moment that
you closed
the final book,
and the last journal
where you had searched
with urgency
and all your brilliance,
for one more cure.
The one that would,
though hard to find,
be carrying your name.
When you were beaten
you would nod,
as if to say
'the subject's closed',
that's what you did.
As to the rest of us,
those  left,
we were perplexed
and short of words,
of clever thoughts.
And were expected
(and observed)
to show appropriate
behaviour,
like grief
and talent
of an organising spirit.
Which, being in a
niche of status
in a society,
stitched and
held together
by musty remnants
of our everlasting
bourgeoisie.
We did.
This time, old man
I want to warn you
in advance
with unaccustomed
and antipodean-like
courtesy,
there will be little
if any
conversation.
What,  with the kid,
she'd be so
ill-prepared
and might get
traumatised.
In any case,
we said our piece
last visit,
surely you remember,
it's when I asked
if you were comfy
in that hole,
hopefully not cold.
Not much to add this time,
though here is one,
a thought
to cheer you up,
I know it will,
you've had one
Father's Day already,
and I, respectful son,
who lives in
a Down Under
that's still above
the ground
(what a pun, sorry) ,
brings you another one,
a different date
from different worlds.
Thus you get two
just for the price of one.
So, I must close now.
My plane is leaving,
soon, too soon perhaps,
just wanted you to know
that I'll be there
to say Hello and
Happy Father's Day.
'Til then,
from man to man,
I send respect
to you, while going
back in time
to very early
memories."

without a cloud in the sky
I'm only happy in these chains

I'm only happy when I bleed

I'm only happy when I need
just myself to survive
I'm only happy when I dream
of my long lost love
I'm only happy when I scream
at the Heavens above
I'm only happy when I'm alone
at war with my brain
I'm only happy when I've known
that life is just pain
I'm only happy when I'm lost
and I can't find my way
I'm only happy when I've crossed
the path of disarray
I'm only happy when I see
death is my way out
I know I'll be free
I have no doubt
I'm only happy when I'm told
that I've gone insane
I'm only happy when I hold
all these thoughts in my brain
I'm only happy when I sleep
and go out of my mind
I'm only happy when I'm in too deep
I'm only happy when it's me you cannot find"

wise to the world - amongst his family.
When shall I see again my place of birth,
its chimney smoke, and at what time of year,
when seen that little, modest, plot of earth
which means far more to me than I draw here.
I’m drawn far more to my ancestral home
than to a Roman palace fine and proud,
prefer fine slate to marble, rather roam
along the Loire than sport midst Tiber’s crowd.
My Liré I prefer to Palatine,
and to sea air, soft climate Angevine.

Heureux qui, comme Ulysse, a fait un beau voyage
Heureux qui, comme Ulysse, a fait un beau voyage
Ou comme celui là qui conquit la toison,
Et puis est retourné, plein d’usage et raison,
Vivre entre ses parents le reste de son âge!
Quand reverrai-je, hélas, de mon petit village
Fumer la cheminée: et en quelle saison
Reverrai-je le clos de ma pauvre maison,
Qui m’est une province, et beaucoup d’avantage!
Plus me plaît le séjour qu’ont bâti mes ayeux,
Que des palais Romains le front audacieux:
Plus que le marbre dur me plaît l’ardoise fine,
Plus mon Loire Gaulois que le Tibre Latin,
Plus mon petit Liré que le mont Palatin,
Et plus que l’air marin la douceur Angevine.
Joachim du Bellay 1515_1560
Triste Qui, Comme Charles
Triste qui, comme Charles, a fait un beau mariage,
Et qui donc une fois conquise la toison,
Se retrouve chez soi, plein d’usage et raison,
Vivre entre ses parents le reste de son âge!
Quand donc reverra-t-il, sans ce remue-ménage
Fumer sa cheminée: et en quelle saison
Reverra-t-il le clos de Windsor et d’Eton,
Qui lui est royaume uni, et beaucoup d’avantages!
Plus lui plaît le séjour qu’ont bâti ses aïeux,
Que la face à Diane à[f]front audacieux:
Le palais brûlé - dur! - plaît plus qu’ardoise indigne,
Plus son livre Gallois que perdre son Latin,
Plus ses délires et rêves que le mont Vénusien,
Et plus que l’air malin la douceur Camilline.

Happy as the Cock
Happy proud rooster who has travelled far
Across life's stream with hens in indian file,
Preened white, red comb, and walked the gangplank trial
Penned in terse lines that verse bright humour's star.
Yearning for home, who roamed, to pen they are,
Assured of rest, returning, strut in style,
Say best nest eggs they'll lay, loud crow awhile.
Triumphant cock-a-doodle echoes jar
Hard-hearted humans who aren't up to par,
Eggs daily may not lay, nor soar mobile,
Current carried, fair through air agile,
Or cluck like duck to woodchuck.  Men, bizarre,
Chuckle they are born to lead, indeed
Know not lead rots hot head, heads for poor breed!

And just think of the kicks
when you're seventy six.
Your'e still growing at age forty-eight."

1166,Emotion,HappyPoemsAHappyLipMdashBreaksSuddenPoembyEmilyDickinson,"353
A happy lip—breaks sudden—
It doesn't state you how
It contemplated—smiling—
Just consummated—now—
But this one, wears its merriment
So patient—like a pain—
Fresh gilded—to elude the eyes
Unqualified, to scan—"
1167,Emotion,HappyPoemsHappyDustPoembyAleisterCrowley,"For Margot
Snow that fallest from heaven, bear me aloft on thy wings
To the domes of the star-girdled Seven, the abode of
ineffable things,
Quintessence of joy and of strength, that, abolishing
future and past,
Mak'st the Present an infinite length, my soul all-One
with the Vast,
The Lone, the Unnameable God, that is ice of His
measureless cold,
Without being or form or abode, without motion or
matter, the fold
Where the shepherded Universe sleeps, with nor sense
nor delusion nor dream,
No spirit that wantons or weeps, no thought in its silence
supreme.
I sit, and am utterly still; in mine eyes is my fathomless
lust
Ablaze to annihilate Will, to crumble my being to dust,
To calcine the dust to an ash, to burn up the ash to an air,
To abolish the air with a flash of the final, the fulminant
flare.
All this I have done, and dissolved the primordial germ
of my thought;
I have rolled myself up, and revolved the wheel of my
being to Naught.
Is there even the memory left? That I was, that I am?
It is lost.
As I utter the Word, I am cleft by the last swift spear of
the frost.
Snow! I am nothing at last; I sit, and am utterly still;
They are perished, the phantoms, and past; they were
born of my weariness-will
When I craved, craved being and form, when the con-
sciousness-cloud was a mist
Precurser of stupor and storm, when I and my shadow
had kissed,
And brought into life all the shapes that confused the
clear space with their marks,
Vain spectres whose vapour escapes, a whirlwind of
ruinous sparks,
No substance have any of these; I have dreamed them in
sickness of lust,
Delirium born of disease-ah, whence was the master,
the ""must""
Imposed on the All? is it true, then, that
something in me
Is subject to fate? Are there two, after all,
that can be?
I have brought all that is to an end; for myself am suffic-
ient and sole.
Do I trick myself now? Shall I rend once again this
homologous Whole?
I have stripped every garment from space; I have
strangled the secre of Time,
All being is fled from my face, with Motion's inhibited
rime.
Stiller and stiller I sit, till even Infinity fades;
'Tis an idol-'tis weakness of wit that breeds, in inanity,
shades!
Yet the fullness of Naught I become, the deepest and
steadiest Naught,
Contains in its nature the sum of the functions of being
and thought.
Still as I sit, and destroy all possible trace of the past,
All germ of the future, nor joy nor knowledge alive at the
last,
It is vain, for the Silence is dowered with a nature, the
seed of a name:
Necessity, fearfully flowered with the blossom of possible
Aim.
I am Necessity? Scry Necessity mother of Fate!
And Fate determines me ""I""; and I have the Will to create.
Vast is the sphere, but it turns on itself like the pettiest
star.
And I am the looby that learns that all things equally are.
Inscrutable Nothing, the Gods, the cosmos of Fire and
of Mist.
Suns,atoms, the clouds and the clouds ineluctably dare
to exist-
I have made the Voyage of Thought, the Voyage of Vision,
I swam
To the heart of the Ocean of Naught from the source of
the Spring of I am:
I know myself wholly the brother alike of the All and the
One;
I know that all things are each other, that their sum and
their substance is None;
But the knowledge itself can excel, its fulness hath broken
its bond;
All's Truth, and all's falsehood as well, and-what of the
region beyond?
So, still though I sit, as for ever, I stab to the heart of my
spine;
I destroy the last seed of endeavour to seal up my soul
in the shrine
Of Silence, Eternity, Peace; I abandon the Here and the
Now;
I cease from the effort to cease; I absolve the dead I from
its Vow,
I am wholly content to be dust, whether that be a mote
or a star,
To live and to love and to lust, acknowledge what seem
for what are,
Not to care what I am, if I be, whence I came, whither go,
how I thrive,
If my spirit be bound or be free, save as Nature contrive.
What I am, that I am, 'tis enough. I am part of a glorious
game.
Am I cast for madness or love? I am cast to esteem them
the same.
Am I only a dream in the sleep of some butterfly?
Phantom of fright
Conceived, who knows how, or how deep, in the measure-
less womb of the night?
I imagine impossible thought, metaphysical voids that
beget
Ideas intagible wrought to things less conceivable yet.
It may be. Little I reck -but, assume the existence of
earth.
Am I born to be hanged by the neck, a curse from the
hour of my birth?
Am I born to abolish man's guilt? His horrible heritage,
awe?
Or a seed in his wantoness spilt by a jester? I care not
a straw,
For I understand Do what thou wilt; and that is the whole
of the Law."

1171,Emotion,HappyPoemshappyBirthdayMyDearSisterClemenciaPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"The strong-girl of our home!
She did the hardest chores;
And helped mother at work,
And locked the house’s doors.
She was a simple dame;
But received all the blame;
She yearned for love and name;
Life played a cruel game!
She loved to talk her heart,
And learned on own some art;
Unlucky on her part,
She remains right from start.
She is an Aquarian;
Devoted Marian;
She leads a spinster’s life,
Alone, amidst much strife.
May God bless my sister,
On her birthday today!
And grant her will-power
To walk in Heaven’s way.

1172,Emotion,HappyPoemsAHappyManPoembyEdwinArlingtonRobinson,"When these graven lines you see,
Traveller, do not pity me;
Though I be among the dead,
Let no mournful word be said.
Children that I leave behind,
And their children, all were kind;
Near to them and to my wife,
I was happy all my life.
My three sons I married right,
And their sons I rocked at night;
Death nor sorrow never brought
Cause for one unhappy thought.
Now, and with no need of tears,
Here they leave me, full of years,--
Leave me to my quiet rest
In the region of the blest."

Heavy laden with regret

1174,Emotion,HappyPoemsToSpeakOfHappyThingsPoembyRainStorm,"I want to speak of happy things,
Like flying on love's wings,
Like sitting beneath the palm trees
As we talk about the birds and the bees.
I want to be happy again,
To remember things from way back when,
To speak excitedly of here and there
Knowing that I truly haven't been anywhere.
I don't want to worry,
I don't want to fret,
I want to be as care free
As I can possibly get.
But in this world I live,
Nothing seems to give,
Happiness is just a word,
And a life without fear
Is just plain absurd."
1175,Emotion,HappyPoemsHowHappyIsTheLittleStonePoembyEmilyDickinson,"1510
How happy is the little Stone
That rambles in the Road alone,
And doesn't care about Careers
And Exigencies never fears—
Whose Coat of elemental Brown
A passing Universe put on,
And independent as the Sun
Associates or glows alone,
Fulfilling absolute Decree
In casual simplicity—"
1176,Emotion,HappyPoemsHappyBirthdayPoembyRaviSathasivam,"Birthdays comes and goes in every year
but few remains with us as golden memories
Its a special day to celebrate with loved ones
Although, the years carry our age away
but every aged year brings happiness into our heart
Life is full of ups and down, weary or teary
but life goes always with smile instead of frown
The candles have been blown off to say good bye to old year
and then the cakes is cut to say welcome to new age
The birthday song sung to forget the world
and the birthday wishes keep pouring to live more
When the birthday gifts are overflowing on the table
and impatient face is glowing to open them.
Dine and wine are served unlimited
Music followed by dance to remember unforgettable day
'Happy Birthday To You' that is last words that we hear
from each and everyone and again the drums are silent
for another year to come."
1177,Emotion,HappyPoemsTheHappyHuntingGroundsPoembyEmilyPaulineJohnson,"Into the rose gold westland, its yellow prairies roll,
World of the bison's freedom, home of the Indian's soul.
Roll out, O seas! in sunlight bathed,
Your plains wind-tossed, and grass enswathed.
Farther than vision ranges, farther than eagles fly,
Stretches the land of beauty, arches the perfect sky,
Hemm'd through the purple mists afar
By peaks that gleam like star on star.
Fringing the prairie billows, fretting horizon's line,
Darkly green are slumb'ring wildernesses of pine,
Sleeping until the zephyrs throng
To kiss their silence into song.
Whispers freighted with odour swinging into the air,
Russet needles as censers swing to an altar, where
The angels' songs are less divine
Than duo sung twixt breeze and pine.
Laughing into the forest, dimples a mountain stream,
Pure as the airs above it, soft as a summer dream,
O! Lethean spring thou'rt only found
Within this ideal hunting ground.
Surely the great Hereafter cannot be more than this,
Surely we'll see that country after Time's farewell kiss.
Who would his lovely faith condole?
Who envies not the Red-skin's soul,
Sailing into the cloud land, sailing into the sun,
Into the crimson portals ajar when life is done?
O! dear dead race, my spirit too
Would fain sail westward unto you."

Thank you my mother for bringing me into this world

Thank you my mother for all your guiding philosophies

Both parents slog all life for their children;
And children honor parents, without rod;
All walk united en way to Heaven.
A happy family lives in piety;
Their home is warm and welcomes everyone;
They’re satisfied and live with satiety;
There’s time for love, care, work, play, also fun!
A happy family loves its neighbors well;
All share their joys, woes, grief and problems too;
Their faith in God, their smiling faces tell;
With divine aim, all earthly works, they do!
A happy family prays in harmony;
God meets their needs of body, soul, money!

Happy new year to you,
Say you,
Wish you,
Bid you with the benediction,
But revel you not
In new year revelries
Just as revellers do
After being rowdy,
Taking to full,
Emptying wine bottles,
Consuming more and more wine,
Just as drunkards do
Dancing and enjoying
To end themselves."
1181,Emotion,HappyPoemsHappyDaysPoembyMaryHannayFoott,"A fringe of rushes -- one green line
Upon a faded plain;
A silver streak of water-shine --
Above, tree-watchers twain.
It was our resting-place awhile,
And still, with backward gaze,
We say: ""'Tis many a weary mile --
But there were happy days.""
And shall no ripple break the sand
Upon our farther way?
Or reedy ranks all knee-deep stand?
Or leafy tree-tops sway?
The gold of dawn is surely met
In sunset's lavish blaze;
And -- in horizons hidden yet --
There shall be happy days."
1182,Emotion,HappyPoemsHappyGravePoembyUriahHamilton,"My lovely kitten,
Eternity kissed,
You brought miracle joy
With your beaming brown eyes;
You delivered visions,
You let the mind drift
Into esoteric meditations
Like satellites
Into planetary explorations;
I now find God in mysterious dreams
Where door locks unbolt
By the power of psychic thoughts.
Angelic love beings
Float through the atmosphere
Like mystical feathers;
There is an invisible caress,
Felt nonetheless,
It finds me when I’m lost,
Helps me when
I’m darkness depressed.
I will fling death
Into a happy grave
And live forever!"
1183,Emotion,HappyPoemsSonnet28HowCanIThenReturnInHappyPlightPoembyWilliamShakespeare,"How can I then return in happy plight
That am debarred the benefit of rest?
When day's oppression is not eased by night,
But day by night, and night by day oppressed?
And each, though enemies to either's reign,
Do in consent shake hands to torture me,
The one by toil, the other to complain
How far I toil, still farther off from thee.
I tell the day, to please him, thou art bright
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven;
So flatter I the swart-complexioned night,
When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.
But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,
And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger."
1184,Emotion,HappyPoemsHymnXiiiHappySoulThatFreeFromHarmsPoembyJohnWesley,"Happy soul that free from harms
Rests within his Shepherd's arms!
Who his quiet shall molest?
Who shall violate his rest?
Jesus doth his spirit bear,
Jesus takes his every care;
He who found the wandering sheep,
Jesus still delights to keep.
O that I might so believe,
Steadfastly to Jesus cleave,
On his only love rely,
Smile at the destroyer nigh;
Free from sin and servile fear,
Have my Jesus ever near,
All his care rejoice to prove,
All his paradise of love!
Jesus, seek thy wandering sheep,
Bring me back, and lead, and keep;
Take on thee my every care,
Bear me, on thy bosom bear:
Let me know my Shepherd's voice,
More and more in thee rejoice,
More and more of thee receive,
Ever in thy Spirit live:
Live, till all thy life I know,
Perfect through my Lord below,
Gladly then from earth remove,
Gathered to the fold above.
O that I at last may stand
With the sheep at thy right hand,
Take the crown so freely given,
Enter in by thee to heaven!"
1185,Emotion,HappyPoemsInMemoryOfAHappyDayInFebruaryPoembyAnneBrontë,"Blessed be Thou for all the joy
My soul has felt today!
O let its memory stay with me
And never pass away!
I was alone, for those I loved
Were far away from me,
The sun shone on the withered grass,
The wind blew fresh and free.
Was it the smile of early spring
That made my bosom glow?
'Twas sweet, but neither sun nor wind
Could raise my spirit so.
Was it some feeling of delight,
All vague and undefined?
No, 'twas a rapture deep and strong,
Expanding in the mind!
Was it a sanguine view of life
And all its transient bliss­-
A hope of bright prosperity?
O no, it was not this!
It was a glimpse of truth divine
Unto my spirit given
Illumined by a ray of light
That shone direct from heaven!
I felt there was a God on high
By whom all things were made.
I saw His wisdom and his power
In all his works displayed.
But most throughout the moral world
I saw his glory shine;
I saw His wisdom infinite,
His mercy all divine.
Deep secrets of his providence
In darkness long concealed
Were brought to my delighted eyes
And graciously revealed.
But while I wondered and adored
His wisdom so divine,
I did not tremble at his power,
I felt that God was mine.
I knew that my Redeemer lived,
I did not fear to die;
Full sure that I should rise again
To immortality.
I longed to view that bliss divine
Which eye hath never seen,
To see the glories of his face
Without the veil between."

1187,Emotion,HappyPoemsHappy81stBirthdayPrinceLeonardPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"Imagine, folks, he's barely up
and sits there with his coffee cup,
while reminiscing of the past
when time just flew, so very fast.
A sip of Java, then a nod,
it surely was the will of God,
this land where wheat has always grown
transformed,  a country of his own.
He had the guts, the fortitude
that saw some lawyers come unglued.
They said he had no valid reason
and that he was committing treason.
With musical formality
he built his principality.
It is well known that those who rule
attract corruption, like the fool
who speaks of better times to come.
For you it's water, he drinks rum.
Those 'servants' make for us decisions
while acting like all politicians,
we know that,  as they move their lips
they give us tons of clever fibs.
I say those people have a nerve,
they've got it wrong and make US  serve!
Well, I, for one, prefer to be
a common man, yet one who's free.
The world, as is, makes little sense
it lacks the word 'benevolence'.
And, if you think they are insane
you're right, they lost the word 'humane'.
Here, in a place called HRP
a Royal couple serves your tea.
So, when you make your travel plans,
the place where no shenanigans
or phony blokes pursue deception,
you'll get a personal reception.
Then stay a while, there, on the land
and shake the Royal couple's hand.
Look at the treasures, take it in,
the atmosphere, the smiles that win.
Today, throughout the world it rings,
the sound of bells for Queens and Kings.
Our voices, can you hear them call?
A Happy Birthday, from us all!"
1188,Emotion,HappyPoemsSonnetViiiAHappyMadnessPoembySandraOsborne,"Happiness. Can’t say I’ve ever had it.
Once I met a gleaming happy person,
He was beaming as he asked me to sit,
Said he would tell me how to have some fun.
Said he never worried at all for others,
Said he never cared for the world at all,
Said no man in the world was his brother
Said he never cared for the ones who fall.
Said you can’t be happy with that worry,
Said to be happy, to do as he said.
Said life is short and gone in a hurry,
Said no one remembers you when you’re dead.
So I told him then I’d rather be sad,
He wasn’t happy, instead he was Mad."
1189,Emotion,HappyPoemsTheHappyHouseholdPoembyEugeneField,"It's when the birds go piping and the daylight slowly breaks,
That, clamoring for his dinner, our precious baby wakes;
Then it's sleep no more for baby, and it's sleep no more for me,
For, when he wants his dinner, why it's dinner it must be!
And of that lacteal fluid he partakes with great ado,
While gran'ma laughs,
And gran'pa laughs,
And wife, she laughs,
And I - well, I laugh, too!
You'd think, to see us carrying on about that little tad,
That, like as not, that baby was the first we'd ever had;
But, sakes alive! he isn't, yet we people make a fuss
As if the only baby in the world had come to us!
And, morning, noon, and night-time, whatever he may do,
Gran'ma, she laughs,
Gran'pa, he laughs,
Wife, she laughs,
And I, of course, laugh, too!
But once - a likely spell ago - when that poor little chick
From teething or from some such ill of infancy fell sick,
You wouldn't know us people as the same that went about
A-feelin' good all over, just to hear him crow and shout;
And, though the doctor poohed our fears and said he'd pull him through,
Old gran'ma cried,
And gran'pa cried,
And wife, she cried,
And I - yes, I cried, too!
It makes us all feel good to have a baby on the place,
With his everlastin' crowing and his dimpling, dumpling face;
The patter of his pinky feet makes music everywhere,
And when he shakes those fists of his, good-by to every care!
No matter what our trouble is, when he begins to coo,
Old gran'ma laughs,
And gran'pa laughs,
Wife, she laughs,
And I - you bet, I laugh, too!"

How I loved you growing into a beautiful woman
How much I wanted the best for you
Now I love what you have become
I watched you bloom like a beautiful flower
You nourished my life with your presence
You made me feel secure in my love
I am so proud of who you are
You taught me so much
Often it was not easy
We suffered in sorrow together
I was the tree…you were the strong branch
Now you have become the tree
Now, you are a mother yourself
Now a mother’s love you can see
I thank God you are a part of me forever
You are only one day older than you were yesterday
Your birthday reminds us to celebrate your life
Be joyful, be fruitful, be peaceful, and be healthy

1192,Emotion,HappyPoemsHappyNewYearToAllPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"On poemhunter's busy streets
your average Joe most surely meets
if so inclined, the cream of words
one finds the free spirits and nerds,
it's been a home to visit often
each stay means that inside we soften
and learn so effort-free from others,
then tease our new poetic brothers
and sisters, uncles like Lamont
who teaches us the proper font
and Jefferson, Sir Boxershorts
whose comments can be blunt, of sorts.
There's Jerry, Allan, Ernestine
and Mary, always on the scene,
Mahnaz and Sally, Adrienne
Ulrike, Sonja, countless men.
I cannot mention all today
but do permit me, here to say
that I am glad the wars are won
as recently I sold my gun
it's nice to come here to relax
away from telephone and fax
a cozy cabin in the woods,
no gangster clowns with funny hoods,
let's all sit by our crackling fire
read poetry that we admire
and add our humble, heartfelt lines
while tasting from those ancient wines
from genes that will not ever die
and words that laugh and sometimes cry.
Let us send praises to the man
who built this cabin for our clan
perhaps we shall, two-thousand six
through cunning and some harmless tricks
become acquainted with this kind
and generous and gracious mind.
To him and all who share this site
let us turn up our guiding light
be kind to those who may dropp in
treat all as equals, next of kin.
May all be blessed by perfect health
and those who must, God give you wealth
may happiness, a constant grin
be with you like a second skin.
For those whose names I may have missed
and others, whom in thought I've kissed
to bring this faux to my attention
the proper way that you must mention
is in the forum, your objection.
So, grab a pen and some reflection
write a rebuttal with your views
it may appear as forum news."

she pulled the sheet up over her eyes
until he was buttoning his shirt:
not shyness for their bodies- those
they had willingly displayed- but a frail
endeavour to apologise.
Later, though, drawn together by
a distaste for such 'untidy ends'
they agreed to meet again; whereupon
they giggled, reminisced, held hands
as though what they had made was love-
and not that happier outcome- friends."

1195,Emotion,HappyPoemsWhatCanMakeYouHappyPoembyJuliusBabarinsa,"Are you happy right now or sad?
Are you bitter about your present condition?
You wonder what is wrong with your life
You wonder why others are happy
And question why some are so sad
Are happy people born that way?
Or happiness is a state of mind
What can make you happy?
Will having more money make you happy?
How much money do you need to make you happy?
If you are single and not happy!
Will having a new lover make you happy?
Will getting married make you happy?
If you are married, and not happy!
Will having more children make you happy?
Will sleeping with other people make you happy?
If you are a professional and not happy!
Will changing your profession make you happy?
What can make you happy?
Will getting drunk everyday make you happy?
Will taking a new drug make you happy?
Will buying a new car make you happy?
What can make you happy?
Will moving to a bigger house make you happy?
Will been promoted at work make you happy?
Will been the head of your organization
Make you happy
What can make you happy?
Always remember that what makes
You happy can make the others sad"
1196,Emotion,HappyPoemsHappyHappyNewYearPoembyNeelaNathDas,"It's true that in one life
One can't achieve what he wishes,
Or can reach his goal.
It's true, fire in cold may take lives.
And water drowns if it flows over head.
Still, life never bans fire and water.
Hope and despair dancing between sunshine and rain,
Never stop us to move forward.
We cry, we laugh, we fall, we rise,
We hug life to say yes to death.
None is foe, none is enemy,
Alone we come, alone we go.
Keeping a chuckle on our lips,
We must say, may happiness lie everywhere,
In everyone's life....

Then tell me why I'm empty.
Why do I feel so low?
I wonder what is wrong with me
and if I'll ever know.
My brain say's 'stop debating..
you over-think too much! '
But, my heart just screams and begs for things
like time and things of such.
The little things I'm needing.
Just little, thoughtful things,
not the fancy houses
or the cars and diamond rings.
Maybe I'm just greedy.
I should be satisfied.
So I will do just like I should.
My feelings I will hide.
Perhaps I am too different.
I feel my heart can't show.
I fear I'll always be this way...
deep in sorrow when no one knows."

The love that said forever, forever
and then runs you over like a truck?
Are you a prayer that floats into a radio advertisement?
Despair,
I don't like you very well.
You don't suit my clothes or my cigarettes.
Why do you locate here
as large as a tank,
aiming at one half of a lifetime?
Couldn't you just go float into a tree
instead of locating here at my roots,
forcing me out of the life I've led
when it's been my belly so long?
All right!

where for so many years
my arms have been speechless"

Is parabolic in isolation, I’ll vet
The consequence and despair, despair
Will serve my hunger –
- Later -
And I’ll wait, wait for something,
Something greater -
Wait and I’ll wait
And I will have no pride -
The clouds will cast their twisted shadows
Over silver stallions that we ride.
The move away from - the publicans, the executors;
The prophets of destruction - shall we
Raise our crystal glasses, shall we
Utter bitter curses - curses
On the pain.
I’ll wipe away the tears - I’ll brush aside her hair;
It rains in these – this paradise -
A torrent of despair."

No reason to sadly wander
On these broken lonely streets
Except for the purpose,
The desperate prayer,
Of seeing her again,
My precious friend
Of the alienated boulevards.
It’s been four years
Since we’ve kissed,
I was a small boy then
Who didn’t know
Anything about love
And I know less than ever now.
Romantic heartbreak
Has always been
My only destination,
My crestfallen relationship
To the universe
Is to be a weeping star
Revolving around
A planet of despair."

Die because a woman's fair?
Or make pale my cheeks with care
'Cause another's rosy are?
Be she fairer than the day,
Or the flow'ry meads in May,
If she be not so to me,
What care I how fair she be?
Shall my heart be griev'd or pin'd
'Cause I see a woman kind?
Or a well-disposed nature
Joined with a lovely feature?
Be she meeker, kinder, than
Turtle dove or pelican,
If she be not so to me,
What care I how kind she be?
Shall a woman's virtues move
Me to perish for her love?
Or her well-deserving known
Make me quite forget mine own?
Be she with that goodness blest
Which may gain her name of best
If she be not such to me,
What care I, how good she be?
'Cause her fortune seems too high
Shall I play the fool and die?
Those that bear a noble mind,
Where they want of riches find,
Think what with them they would
That without them dare to woo;
And unless that mind I see,
What care I how great she be?
Great, or good, or kind, or fair,
I will ne'er the more despair;
If she love me, this believe,
I will die ere she shall grieve;
If she slight me when I woo,
I can scorn and let her go;
For if she be not for me,
What care I for whom she be?"

certain rules might not abide
returned from land again to ocean
one does not see any plausible reason
In the very first observation
arguably one sees no pattern
with the moving of time
somewhere in mind there strikes a rhyme
a flash of light
a glow of hope
to lay things straight
with a constant hope
the pattern is figured
the purpose served
still looms the uncertainty
observed pattern fails at infinity
Despair seeps in, one looses the power of will
Sinking in the past, making time to go standstill

The source of deep depression

I try to ''keep my chin up''

I also take a fall.

we never let it
dig our heart

they fall, resigned
to the fact that

trail the last wind

When the golden sunbeams are all abroad;

We watch it stealthily creeping o'er
The threshold leading to somebody's soul;
A shadow, we cry, it cannot be more
When faith is one's portion and Heaven one's goal.
A ghost that comes stealing its way along,
Affrighting the weak with its gruesome air,
But who that is young and glad and strong
Fears for a moment to meet Despair?
To this heart of ours we have thought so bold
All uninvited it comes one day-
Lo! faith grows wan, and love grows cold,
And the heaven of our dreams lies far away."

By Nature only for my sorrows made,
I'll spend this voyce in crys,
In tears I'll waste these eyes
By Love so vainly fed;
So Lust of old the Deluge punished.
Ah wretched youth! said I,
'Ah, wretched youth!' twice did I sadly cry:
'Ah, wretched youth!' the fields and floods reply.
When thoughts of Love I entertain,
I meet no words but 'Never,' and 'In vain.'
'Never' alas that dreadful name
Which fuels the infernal flame:
'Never,' My time to come must waste;
'In vain,' torments the present and the past.
'In vain, in vain!' said I;
'In vain, in vain!' twice did I sadly cry;
'In vain, in vain!' the fields and floods reply.
No more shall fields or floods do so;
For I to shades more dark and silent go:
All this world's noise appears to me
A dull ill-acted comedy:
No comfort to my wounded sight,
In the suns busy and imperti'nent Light.
Then down I laid my head;
Down on cold earth; and for a while was dead,
And my freed soul to a strange somewhere fled.
'Ah, sottish Soul' said I,
When back to its cage again I saw it fly;
'Fool to resume her broken chain!
And row her galley here again!'
'Fool, to that body to return
Where it condemn'd and destin'd is to burn!
Once dead, how can it be,
Death should a thing so pleasant seem to thee,
That thou should'st come to live it o're again in me?'"

Deprived of the right to speak loud
Of wicked intentions gone wrong -
Erasers have muffled the shout.
The only illusion-proof mind -
A poet, the voice of despair,
Sincere, the one of this kind
Throws verses far into the air

Thro' the cypress forests sighing,
In the night-wind madly flying,
Hellish forms with streaming hair;
In the barren branches creaking,
By the stagnant swamp-pools speaking,
Past the shore-cliffs ever shrieking,
Damn'd demons of despair.
Once, I think I half remember,
Ere the grey skies of November
Quench'd my youth's aspiring ember,
Liv'd there such a thing as bliss;
Skies that now are dark were beaming,
Bold and azure, splendid seeming
Till I learn'd it all was dreaming -
Deadly drowsiness of Dis.
But the stream of Time, swift flowing,
Brings the torment of half-knowing -
Dimly rushing, blindly going
Past the never-trodden lea;
And the voyager, repining,
Sees the wicked death-fires shining,
Hears the wicked petrel's whining
As he helpless drifts to sea.
Evil wings in ether beating;
Vultures at the spirit eating;
Things unseen forever fleeting
Black against the leering sky.
Ghastly shades of bygone gladness,
Clawing fiends of future sadness,
Mingle in a cloud of madness
Ever on the soul to lie.
Thus the living, lone and sobbing,
In the throes of anguish throbbing,
With the loathsome Furies robbing
Night and noon of peace and rest.
But beyond the groans and grating
Of abhorrent Life, is waiting
Sweet Oblivion, culminating
All the years of fruitless quest."

He has lost him copmletely,     as if he had never been at all.
For he wanted -- so he said --     he wanted to be saved
from the stigmatized,     the sick sensual delight;
from the stigmatized,     sensual delight of shame.
There was still time --     as he said -- to be saved.
He has lost him completely,     as if he had never been at all.
In his imagination,     in his delusions,

Whom do I turn to? To unlock the discord,

Millions line the dole queues,
as jobs fall daily to accounting cuts.
Life becomes a struggle for daily bread;
bills grow like mountains,
assaulting the conscious brain.
Fists hammer on front doors for monies owing,
disturbances cause neighbours
to look through corners of curtains,
gossip is rife on family’s shame.
Millions spent of foreign aid,
but what about our own impoverished land?
Who is going to give our own a helping hand?
The sad look pleading, in hungry despair.
Who hears these voices call,
only the unfortunate such as they."
1217,Emotion,DespairPoemsIndirectlyInTheDespairOfConcealmentPoembyRICBASTASA,"i always see to it
that i understand what a family is
when we went to a trip
we make the pact
inside the plane that moment when
we step upon the plastic floors of the tarmac
i have already seen the hint
we understand i repeat we always understand
when we were there at the saigon shopping complex
we too understand
the family segregates as one block
shields itself from our interference
we understand that
and so we too have to create our own path
go somewhere else
to the market to the park to the palace of the president
we must learn to enjoy things by ourselves
we are not really a family
but splinters of dreams
one must realize
to each his own no dependence
one makes a story
fabricates the rest of the characters
develops the plot
complicate matters and then
arrive at the resolution of the big conflict
finally i decide
a poem is better this way
intrepid, limpid, crisscross,
wanting to open but must only show the closed door
to reveal but only to arrive at the consensus
that it is better concealed
mouths silent, lips sealed
hands that dance in the sky enclosing the fingers
with the sun"
1218,Emotion,DespairPoemsDespairIsDarknessPoembyShalomFreedman,"DESPAIR IS DARKNESS
Despair is darkness-
Despair is death inside and death in the world and death in one’s own sad soul-
Despair is no way out -
Despair is the place where one is forever stuck -
Despair is the realization that one has done what one could – and one is not going anywhere else-
Despair is the admission of failure-
Despair is no sign of help anywhere around-
Despair is so much lost-
Despair is one‘s life is over-
Despair is regret-
Despair is the sense that one will never have the time to have another chance -
Despair is ‘it’s finished’-
Despair is no way out-
Despair is going down and more down and more dark and more afraid all the time -
Despair is the scream which hurts and does not stop the hurting -
Despair is the understanding that even Death will not save one -
Despair is that the pain will never end-not even with death.
Despair is no way out again and again and again- without end."
1219,Emotion,DespairPoemsDarkDespairPoembyKevinCarney,"So sick of it all….
The trust of it all vanished in the wind…
The truth may it be was all a pack of lies…
It was only the path to achieve your ways…
So angry you’ll never know…
So hurt, I can never say…
The words I want to say just can’t come out…
The tears I shed are no longer for you…
You took it to the limit, knowing how gullible I would be.
The fool you played me for, you knew me so well.
You manipulated you smile just at the right moment…
You shed your tears when you thought I would walk away.
So easy it was for you to tell me you cared…
So blind I was to see you were never really there…
The times of the moment, the belief in you…
Led me down your path, to see me be an ass…
I can’t say it was your entire fault…
So much I have myself to blame…
I think you must have sat up in your room…
Alone in the dark
figuring how you could pull my strings…
Listen to me sit here and complain…
I should have opened my eyes to what was around…
I should have been more careful to control my emotions…
Just by chance I learned of what you were planning of me…
So expendable I was to become,
it was all in good time.
A use for me, as you drained the blood from my veins…
Too much it is all for me, a breach of my mind and soul…
Both have been so tainted and so diseased…
I tried and tried to stay here with you…
As I learned it was only a façade created by you…
I looked into the mirror; only to see my dead eyes…
My face so pale and white, you sucked the life out of me…
You sold yourself to me, only it wasn’t what I really saw.
The game you played ever so perfect, such poise and balance…
I saw it all too late, the damage being done…
Leaving me so hurt and so cold, sitting in my dark despair…."

And soothe them with a kindred mind.
A friend or foe to him the same,
He looks on each with equal eye;
The difference lies but in the name,
To none for comfort can he fly.--
'Twas deep despair, and sorrow’s trace,
To him too keenly given,
Whose memory, time could not efface--
His peace was lodged in Heaven.--
He looks on all this world bestows,
The pride and pomp of power,
As trifles best for pageant shows
Which vanish in an hour.
When torn is dear affection's tie,
Sinks the soft heart full low;
It leaves without a parting sigh,
All that these realms bestow.

1221,Emotion,DespairPoemsDespairPoembyKrisEstep,"From where I stand I have no faith,
I look around and see only hate.
Stuck in pain I cannot wake,
From this nightmare that is my fate.
All around me darkness lies,
From which I see not beyond my eyes.
I met this one who shown a light,
Only to have them turn into my plight.
Such hurt, such pain inside of me,
Ever enduring it always seems.
I'm told 'Have faith, I will be saved, '
I think to myself, you're all insane.
For all and all I am alone,
Left in this darkness that I must roam.
From these pits of my despair,
I have learned to never care."

The difference between Despair

Between the instant of a Wreck

Contented as the Eye

1225,Emotion,DespairPoemsASongOfDespairPoembyPabloNeruda,"The memory of you emerges from the night around me.
The river mingles its stubborn lament with the sea.
Deserted like the wharves at dawn.
It is the hour of departure, oh deserted one!
Cold flower heads are raining over my heart.
Oh pit of debris, fierce cave of the shipwrecked.
In you the wars and the flights accumulated.
From you the wings of the song birds rose.
You swallowed everything, like distance.
Like the sea, like time. In you everything sank!
It was the happy hour of assault and the kiss.
The hour of the spell that blazed like a lighthouse.
Pilot's dread, fury of blind driver,
turbulent drunkenness of love, in you everything sank!
In the childhood of mist my soul, winged and wounded.
Lost discoverer, in you everything sank!
You girdled sorrow, you clung to desire,
sadness stunned you, in you everything sank!
I made the wall of shadow draw back,
beyond desire and act, I walked on.
Oh flesh, my own flesh, woman whom I loved and lost,
I summon you in the moist hour, I raise my song to you.
Like a jar you housed infinite tenderness.
and the infinite oblivion shattered you like a jar.
There was the black solitude of the islands,
and there, woman of love, your arms took me in.
There was thirst and hunger, and you were the fruit.
There were grief and ruins, and you were the miracle.
Ah woman, I do not know how you could contain me
in the earth of your soul, in the cross of your arms!
How terrible and brief my desire was to you!
How difficult and drunken, how tensed and avid.
Cemetery of kisses, there is still fire in your tombs,
still the fruited boughs burn, pecked at by birds.
Oh the bitten mouth, oh the kissed limbs,
oh the hungering teeth, oh the entwined bodies.
Oh the mad coupling of hope and force
in which we merged and despaired.
And the tenderness, light as water and as flour.
And the word scarcely begun on the lips.
This was my destiny and in it was my voyage of my longing,
and in it my longing fell, in you everything sank!
Oh pit of debris, everything fell into you,
what sorrow did you not express, in what sorrow are you not drowned!
From billow to billow you still called and sang.
Standing like a sailor in the prow of a vessel.
You still flowered in songs, you still brike the currents.
Oh pit of debris, open and bitter well.
Pale blind diver, luckless slinger,
lost discoverer, in you everything sank!
It is the hour of departure, the hard cold hour
which the night fastens to all the timetables.
The rustling belt of the sea girdles the shore.
Cold stars heave up, black birds migrate.
Deserted like the wharves at dawn.
Only tremulous shadow twists in my hands.
Oh farther than everything. Oh farther than everything.
It is the hour of departure. Oh abandoned one!"
1226,Emotion,DespairPoemsTheValleyOfDespairPoembyPatriciaGrantham,"Lost and trapped in the valley of nothing but despair
Hands held high for help and grasping nothing but air
Alone and much abandoned no one knows you're there
All have turned their backs and none seems to care
You can choose to stay down and wallow in your sorrow
Or speak words that says there is always a tomorrow
Then you will see the sunshine on a bright new day
Rise up from the valley no matter what they say
When others try their best to keep you burdened down
Rise high above their heads with a smile and not a frown
The life that you want to live is solely up to you
So get up shake off the dust and start your life anew
Despair like a vine can creep back into your life again
Loosen its hold and see the sunshine and not the rain
If you know of someone else whose back is to the ground
Take their hands and lift them up for you was also down

1227,Emotion,DespairPoemsTheHarpAndDespairOfCowperPoembyWilliamLisleBowles,"Sweet bard, whose tones great Milton might approve,
And Shakspeare, from high Fancy's sphere,
Turning to the sound his ear,
Bend down a look of sympathy and love;
Oh, swell the lyre again,
As if in full accord it poured an angel's strain!
But oh! what means that look aghast,
Ev'n whilst it seemed in holy trance,
On scenes of bliss above to glance!
Was it a fiend of darkness passed!
Oh, speak--
Paleness is upon his cheek--
On his brow the big drops stand,
To airy vacancy
Points the dread silence of his eye,
And the loved lyre it falls, falls from his nerveless hand!
Come, peace of mind, delightful guest!
Oh, come, and make thy downy nest
Once more on his sad heart!
Meek Faith, a drop of comfort shed;
Sweet Hope, support his aged head;
And Charity, avert the burning dart!
Fruitless the prayer--the night of deeper woes
Seems o'er the head even now to close;
In vain the path of purity he trod,
In vain, in vain,
He poured from Fancy's shell his sweetest hermit strain--
He has no hope on earth: forsake him not, O God!"

1229,Emotion,DespairPoemsASongOfDespairPoembyVIPINSPUTHOORAN,"The night rain sing the song
To benumb my soul all along.
Grief breaks heart's fence
Over the hills of silence
The song of despair!
Floats everywhere in air
The song of despair
Floats everywhere;
Till the depth of heart's creek
To cascade tears through the cheek.
One's heart becomes stone-dead
When their most loved left its stead.
Eyes then lost fore'er its shine,
Nothing will follow there but a shadow;
The only crony I've to say as mine
To walk with me in this despair-meadow.
Once in a medow of love I walked
With my lover and we stalked
Holding her hand in my wrist,
Holding my hand around her waist.
We woven the wings of dreams
And built castles on streams
Life was an ever opened book
Where the moments of love we took,
To draw the most beautiful pictures on its pages
As our hearts were one as a land with no rages
Everytime the hands of destiny write its word
The golden pages of life was engulfed by rust
That made the glitter of love blurred,
Eyes scatter the seeds of despair in dust
No one knows what's destiny,
Until they feel what's despair!"

corks that pop from the other side.
People have come from all over

Haughty looks aristocrats
pulled from homes that are now forfeit.
Children that can't be saved.
Better thee than me a father says.
Walk me home I hear one mother.
Dancing in the streets unpaved.
Distant future from the past in the dawn I hide.
Rhyme or reason treasonous tounge
from the land scape and you can never see.
Unrelated events that came together here.
No warning came to they.
Corks that pop as guns go off and oddly
from the corner of my eye.
I see the rest of them come from the forest
their on fire."

Despair of the darkness
Despair of the Despair
Despair of Old Age
Despair of the road closed
Despair of nothing to do
Despair of nowhere to go
Despair of endless errands
Despair of money running out
Despair of the message of Despair
One transmits to those one loves.
Despair that has to be resisted
Despair that the light of the day
Will help me overcome
Despair I will pray my way out of
Despair I will in the course of the day
Sometime overcome.
Not the great Despair
The unending Despair
The final Despair.
The small Despair of who I am and where I am now.
The Despair that still can be resisted,
By the writing of a few awkward lines
Early in the morning."

1233,Emotion,DespairPoemsConnoisseursOfDespairPoembyKevinPatrick,"Sharon tells me she's thrilled
when she sees her skins peeled
From the scrapes of Tommy's fist
bruised from docking with her lip
But she says there always kindred
Infiltrated through her affection
When she gets him cornered down,
Like a housefly on her heel
Counter clockwise in his groin
Which thrills his pupils to counter twitch
On the chessboard colour floor
Where he moans with satisfaction
to be her incandescent whor-
And Even tells me that its heaven
When it's a quarter pass eleven
And little Sara's got him toped,
From an altitude that makes him drop
With her firm technicians grip
That has him writhing into fits
Raptures abound this tender bull
Bandaging him with a tumble fall
And stencils blue onto his neck
It's the comforts of her molesting
His inhibited recluse affections
The best attention always granted
when empathies contracted herpes
Malice quills the confines
of the insipidness of  yuppies
Directing our destruction
In Mutually Assured Romantic Violence
So Bon appetite
We're coinsures of despair
Eloping debacles whenever we dare
To pour gasoline on our match lit embraces
Hiding in desserts to prowl long spaces
Dancing synchronous in a voodoo oasis
Never leaving the affliction of what we call each other
Because we are reflections of the same broken mirror
Entwined in web of malevolent luminescence
From which we cannot so soon depart
It was too soon to dance,
now it's too late to leave
Because Charon drives our four heeled steed
Towards our suicide ménage a trios
Me and her with, a friendly loaded gun
To fill the time with our immortal fun
We're an attractive duet, in Western stand off
Combating the silence, as two warheads in deadlock
So we celebrate the decent
in this tableaux baroque chaos
Trapped in the Kennel where the beggars languish
The starving enchantment of long distant anguish
Drinking the cognac as the connoisseur of despair
So we'll tie my arms in copper knots,
that scratch the veins with clever dots
Please make me crawl until I'm numb,
Stick the rattle in my palm
Than tie the chain around my neck
Make me bleed until I'm strong
Enthralled to burns of your lighter pen
Without your spit Ill fly long gone
Into the bayou of the rusted steam
To dream of teeth in my Capillaries
By the laurel tree that cries to leave
One night stands of archetype tragedies
Bliss is the sunshine at the end of a war
When we learn to walk the trenches of insuperable hell
And realise it's us who we will always drag down
Because we've opened these doors which will never close
Were refugees from some disease
Mad, Corrupt, and spoiled sl-+$
Incarcerated to each other's needs
And always insisting on sipping that substance
Which invalidates reason of proportioned justice
Because we think were suitably happy
when the bed sheets pillar with a companions body
But there is only one black flower who satisfies my hobby
Drinking the wine
as Connoisseurs of Despair"

The dew of my love on the colors
Before the Time rings the bell
Is this Time flowing like river
In flow but the rainbow of colors
I steal from your cheek in wonder
Call the people with loud voices
Is it that I show them my love
Nay in secrete shall I burn to ashes
I shall rise like amber in glow
Time is my rival and leaves me not
What of love and longing and from the dark
Hairs of beloved to the color of the cheek
In sensuous love know ye Time
I cherish my love in her manifestation
Glory be to the sculptor for the creation
Is nothing but His reflection
You think with wine I am drunk like Hafiz
Into those eyes I have drowned in love
Behold the scene when my love shall sing
The laments of existence and of the age cruel
Like lark thou sing with melodies of nature
What ails thy heart my love in the end
Let me finish this song eternal to begin anew
Yet another fine evening when the roses in bloom
A goblet of wine, butterflies in friends facing the sun
Setting behind the horizon welcoming the moon
Long nights of separation shall then follow
O heart dear what have thou stored
For devastation so long when shall moments
Turn into centuries but the aroma of her passion
Shall never leave you for a song of despair

1236,Emotion,DespairPoemsAMeetingWithDespairPoembyThomasHardy,"AS evening shaped I found me on a moor
Which sight could scarce sustain:
The black lean land, of featureless contour,
Was like a tract in pain.
""This scene, like my own life,"" I said, ""is one
Where many glooms abide;
Toned by its fortune to a deadly dun--
Lightless on every side.
I glanced aloft and halted, pleasure-caught
To see the contrast there:
The ray-lit clouds gleamed glory; and I thought,
""There's solace everywhere!""
Then bitter self-reproaches as I stood
I dealt me silently
As one perverse--misrepresenting Good
In graceless mutiny.
Against the horizon's dim-descernèd wheel
A form rose, strange of mould:
That he was hideous, hopeless, I could feel
Rather than could behold.
""'Tis a dead spot, where even the light lies spent
To darkness!"" croaked the Thing.
""Not if you look aloft!"" said I, intent
On my new reasoning.
""Yea--but await awhile!"" he cried. ""Ho-ho!--
Look now aloft and see!""
I looked. There, too, sat night: Heaven's radiant show
Had gone. Then chuckled he."

Which like two spirits do suggest me still:
The better angel is a man right fair,
The worser spirit a woman coloured ill.
To win me soon to hell, my female evil
Tempteth my better angel from my side,
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,
Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
And whether that my angel be turned fiend,
Suspect I may, yet not directly tell;
But being both from me both to each friend,
I guess one angel in another's hell.
Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,
Till my bad angel fire my good one out."
1238,Emotion,DespairPoemsOdeToDespairPoembyMaryDarbyRobinson,"TERRIFIC FIEND! thou Monster fell,
Condemn'd in haunts profane to dwell,
Why quit thy solitary Home,
O'er wide Creation's paths to roam?
Pale Tyrant of the timid Heart,
Whose visionary spells can bind
The strongest passions of the mind,
Freezing Life's current with thy baneful Art.
Nature recoils when thou art near,
For round thy form all plagues are seen;
Thine is the frantic tone, the sullen mien,
The glance of petrifying fear,
The haggard Brow, the low'ring Eye,
The hollow Cheek, the smother'd Sigh,
When thy usurping fangs assail,
The sacred Bonds of Friendship fail.
Meek-bosom'd Pity sues in vain;
Imperious Sorrow spurns relief,
Feeds on the luxury of Grief,
Drinks the hot Tear, and hugs the galling Chain.
AH! plunge no more thy ruthless dart,
In the dark centre of the guilty Heart;
The POW'R SUPREME, with pitying eye,
Looks on the erring Child of Misery;
MERCY arrests the wing of Time;
To expiate the wretch's crime;
Insulted HEAV'N consign'd thy brand
To the first Murd'rer's crimson hand.
Swift o'er the earth the Monster flew,
And round th' ensanguin'd Poisons threw,
By CONSCIENCE goaded­driven by FEAR,
Till the meek Cherub HOPE subdued his fell career.
Thy Reign is past, when erst the brave
Imbib'd contagion o'er the midnight lamp,
Close pent in loathsome cells, where poisons damp
Hung round the confines of a Living Grave; *
Where no glimm'ring ray illum'd
The flinty walls, where pond'rous chains
Bound the wan Victim to the humid earth,
Where VALOUR, GENIUS, TASTE, and WORTH,
In pestilential caves entomb'd,
Sought thy cold arms, and smiling mock'd their pains.
THERE,­each procrastinated hour
The woe-worn suff'rer gasping lay,
While by his side in proud array
Stalk'd the HUGE FIEND, DESPOTIC POW'R.
There REASON clos'd her radiant eye,
And fainting HOPE retir'd to die,
Truth shrunk appall'd,
In spells of icy Apathy enthrall'd;
Till FREEDOM spurn'd the ignominious chain,
And roused from Superstition's night,
Exulting Nature claim'd her right,
And call'd dire Vengeance from her dark domain.
Now take thy solitary flight
Amid the turbid gales of night,
Where Spectres starting from the tomb,
Glide along th' impervious gloom;
Or, stretch'd upon the sea-beat shore,
Let the wild winds, as they roar,
Rock Thee on thy Bed of Stone;
Or, in gelid caverns pent,
Listen to the sullen moan
Of subterranean winds;­or glut thy sight
Where stupendous mountains rent
Hurl their vast fragments from their dizzy height.
At Thy approach the rifted Pine
Shall o'er the shatter'd Rock incline,
Whose trembling brow, with wild weeds drest,
Frowns on the tawny EAGLE's nest;
THERE enjoy the 'witching hour,
And freeze in Frenzy's dire conceit,
Or seek the Screech-owl's lone retreat,
On the bleak rampart of some nodding Tow'r.
In some forest long and drear,
Tempt the fierce BANDITTI's rage,
War with famish'd Tygers wage,
And mock the taunts of Fear.
When across the yawning deep,
The Demons of the Tempest sweep,
Or deaf'ning Thunders bursting cast
Their red bolts on the shivering mast,
While fix'd below the sea-boy stands,
As threat'ning Death his soul dismays,
He lifts his supplicating hands,
And shrieks, and groans, and weeps, and prays,
Till lost amid the floating fire
The agonizing crew expire;
THEN let thy transports rend the air,
For mad'ning Anguish feeds DESPAIR.
When o'er the couch of pale Disease
The MOTHER bends, with tearful eye,
And trembles, lest her quiv'ring sigh,
Should wake the darling of her breast,
Now, by the taper's feeble rays,
She steals a last, fond, eager gaze.
Ah, hapless Parent! gaze no more,
Thy CHERUB soars among the Blest,
Life's crimson Fount begins to freeze,
His transitory scene is o'er.
She starts­she raves­her burning brain,
Consumes, unconscious of its fires,
Dead to the Heart's convulsive Pain,
Bewilder'd Memory retires.
See! See! she grasps her flowing hair,
From her fix'd eye the big drops roll,
Her proud Affliction mocks controul,
And riots in DESPAIR,
Such are thy haunts, malignant Pow'r,
There all thy murd'rous Poisons pour;
But come not near my calm retreat,
Where Peace and holy FRIENDSHIP meet;
Where SCIENCE sheds a gentle ray,
And guiltless Mirth beguiles the day,
Where Bliss congenial to the MUSE
Shall round my Heart her sweets diffuse,
Where, from each restless Passion free,
I give my noiseless hours, BLESS'D POETRY, TO THEE."

Shine on me, eyes which darkened lashes shade,
Turn, turn my way, oh glorious golden head,
My soul is lost, then let the price be paid!
Amid rich flowers your rosy lamplight gleams,
Amid rich hangings pass your scented hours,
And woods and fields are green but in my dreams,
And only in my dreams grow meadow-flowers.
I have forgotten everything but you--
The apple orchard where the whitethroat sings,
The quiet fields, the moonlight, and the dew,
The virgin's bower that in wet hedgerow clings.
I have forgotten how the cool grass waves
Where clean winds blow, and where good women pray
For happy, honest men, safe in their graves;
And--oh, my God! I would I were as they!"

To die and say goodbye,
To everyone that ever cared.

Late up at night holding myself,
Well I cry myself to sleep,
Know that no one cares.

I despise everyday that I am here,

Hurting endlessly,
By people I once thought cared,
Always betrayed,
Feeling a stab in the back,
Friends I once thought cared about me,
But what now.
Turn on me as usual,

My misery knows no allay,
Although my heart has come away.

Says to my soul, 'Can it be done,
'Can it be done, too feeling heart,
That we from her shall live apart?'

'That we, though far from her, are near,
Yea, present, though in exile here?'"

When I walked daily in despair,
How fickled spirits fly
When hope became a daily pain -
Despair a nightly sty.
Until a bridge loomed up ahead -
I dared to walk across
And leave my heart there on the bank
Contented with the loss."
1245,Emotion,DespairPoemsButDonTDespairPoembyMarkRSlaughter,"Despair, if you must –
But how's it going to pull you through?
Despair, when you trust
Naught since then there's naught to do.
Despair, should you thrust
Aside your pride, your self-esteem.
And so despair, if it's dust,
The only substance that you deem.
Despair, when a gust
Of slightly breeze can break your stance.
And do despair, when lust
Is your interpretation of romance.
But don't despair, if you can care
About the plight of any other being.
And you can focus on the help,
Support, and altruistic further actions
For the seeing.  Be believing,
As despair will start receding
All around – simply since you found
A way to steer you clear
From this: the very cause of your despair!
So give to others; give them all a helping lift:
Despair, you'll find will disappear –
And that has got to be a well-deserved
And saintly gift!

Despair in old age
Dead friends
Friends sick and dying
The choice between the treatment
That draws the suffering out
And the sooner and more painful death
The boredom
The sense of one’s own uselessness
The futile striving to not be a hindrance to others
The vain effort not to look like a shipwreck
The sick smell of oneself
The loss of power in so many ways
The small naps in public places
The sense of one’s own uselessness
The understanding one has done what one could
And not done enough
And not done the best
The regret
The hatred of having others doing simple things for you
You can no longer do for yourself
The weakness
The aching
The pain
The boredom
The slowness of mind
The loss of interest
The feeling of oneself as a burden a disappointment
To others
The despair
The hopelessness
The wishing were all over
And the understanding that to finish it
Is to be a coward and leave a horrible legacy
The having too much time and remembering when one never had enough
The feeling of one’s own uselessness
The letting loved ones down
The loneliness
The boredom
The sadness
The hatred and contempt for oneself
And what one has against one’s every wish, become.
The long drawn-out never ending hopelessness of it all."
1247,Emotion,DespairPoemsLivingInDespairPoembyMaryMurphy,"No ones knows just how I feel,
Or what pain I hold inside.
Know one knows just how bad,
I wish I could hide.
This person walking towards me,
Must think they know it all,
I said hello but all I got
Was a laugh because I’m tall.
This man behind the counter
He hasn’t stopped to think,
That he doesn’t even know me,
Yet he laughs at how I drink.
This driver with the temper,
Must be really sure,
That he knows my reason,
Of how I got this poor.
The girls with fancy clothes on,
They just laugh and grin.
But do they ever look deeper,
At the person I am within?
The workers at the work site
They joke and joke away,
But if they only understood
Or hear what I had to say.
Maybe they’d speak different,
Maybe they’d feel shame,
Maybe they would realize,
That I too, can feel pain.
Maybe if the world knew me,
Or even seemed to care,
I would not be forced to be this way,
Living in despair."

But replaced with a kind of hope and sense that- she will tell 'Why do you regret? It is I who has done wrong not you.'
But replaced with a kind of hope and sense that she will realise the deep truth beneath all these lies.......
At the present, I am dying here....inch by inch......

1249,Emotion,DespairPoemsBirthOfDespairPoembyAidanRoss,"I am a man of Poland, man in a land invaded.
I am but content, that my house has not been raided.
I walk up, to my silent home, why does my wife ignore me.
I see my wife and son dead on the floor before me.
JEW, JEW, on the wall in blood like a damned profanity
I look in fear at the madness and insanity.
Two months I have walked the earth and no relief I have yet found.
One day, I saw soldier push a Rabbi to the ground.
He sees the symbol on my neck and puts the rifle to my head.
I now know he wants to make me like the poor Rabbi, Dead.
I wrestle him and put his own bullet through his Heart.
He writhes in pain and hit the dirt, like a twisted work of art.
I know and fear that in hell, I shall soon sit.
But I am more surprised that I was good at it.
So that day, I sold my soul to the dark.
And longer can I walk amongst, the free and lark.
The kraut soldier walks down the street, I crouch down in the Dairy.
He gets a bullet through his head, first to fall to the Mercenary."
1250,Emotion,DespairPoemsFromTheDepthOfDespairPoembyKailaGeorge,"From the depth of despair
You can only whimper and cry
All the pain you feel drowns your very soul
You become encumbered by all that has been
A nightmare, a hell hole…there's nothing no one can do
You have to live through all this…just to stay alive
The outcome is horrific as you feel rendered by the past
You feel crushed, forsaken, yet your heart still beats so fast
Life is something special never let it go
Make every moment count, from this moment on"
1251,Emotion,DespairPoemsFrozenDespairPoembyMandyLee,"Frozen tears fall to the ground,
covering up this weeping sound.
Of lamenting throughout the land.
Seeping through like grains of sand.
It penertrates our very hearts,
paper thin hit with poison darts.
The darkness grows and closes in,
crying out its resounding win.
Fallen hopes and fallen dreams,
deathly cries and chilling screams.
Not a single soul is spared the pain,
We only wait for the Winter's wane."
1252,Emotion,DespairPoemsInUtterHopelessnessAndDespairPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"When things have reached the point of no return;
When life's nadir is reached and you can't climb;
When future looks uncertain gloomy, dark;
When bridge to safety is not tread-worthy;
When things have gone beyond the salvage stage;
When odds are pitted heavily against;
When all attempts for success were futile,
When life looks dreary, meaningless to eke;
When truth and facts can't help us anyway;
When stage of verdict frightens and threatens;
When things have gone too far to broker peace;
When dialog was a wasted time and sums;
Then hope still glimmers like a fading star;
Only recourse is pray, plead to the Lord;
For He can do miracles if faith stays,
As nothing's impossible to our God.

That's what I am
Why does the world
have to be like this?
Why can't things ever
work out for me?
Crying
That's what I'm doing
Crying out tears that drag out
my sadness, my pain, my confusion
Stop
That's what I want to do
Cease feeling the wrongs of the world
All weighing down on me
Until I feel I am crushed
How?
How can I forget the sadness?
How can I stop the pain?
How can I heal these scars
left on my heart?
Never
Never will I be able to rid my life
of all it's troubles
Never can I heal my heart
The wounds may heal
But the scars will remain
Escape
That's what I must do
But where?
Where is there a place safe from all the pain,
all the sadness, the confusion
I must go
I will never survive another day like this
Now
I must be rid of this
It's eating away at my insides
It's slowly causing me to fade
I'm growing weaker, and weaker
The sadness, the pain, the confusion
Despair
That's what this is
I am distraught and in despair
and I can never be rid of it
It is destroying me
Slowly, but surely
I am fading"
1255,Emotion,DespairPoems981InvitationToDespairPoembyMelvinaGermain,"Periwinkle blues, vibrant violets blend together creating an atmosphere
only beholding to the most beautiful creatures ever seen on the earths
ball-room of forever living.  A defiance of immortality, living with the masters
of the dark.
Veils of black dust, streamers of grey silk torment while flowing over the
dark, still waters.  Charcoal eyes seen beneath the quite mirrors of the
ocean sink deep.  Climb in if you dare, enter the world of desperate
measures and despair.
Wait! ! !  Suddenly, an enormous hand appears through the  sky and sends
shades of yellows with silver glints shining through.  Ahhh the sound of
Music began to play, while the angles appear, they dance and dance through
the warm  soothing air.
The ocean begins to ripple and the musical notes fall quietly through the
mirrored water taking their places beneath the still waters.  Angels hover
over the window-like bed and the tears of glory fall through that oceanic
bed.  No more heartbreak or fear.   The master of miracles is here.
The invitation to visit the dark and dismal places of the deep, shall not be
accepted after-all.  For this creature is covered by the hand of God and
Shall live in the land of peace and love, and forever be blessed  by the master
Of good who rules and shines from above.

1257,Emotion,DespairPoemsDespairPoembyPercyByssheShelley,"And canst thou mock mine agony, thus calm
In cloudless radiance, Queen of silver night?
Can you, ye flow'rets, spread your perfumed balm
Mid pearly gems of dew that shine so bright?
And you wild winds, thus can you sleep so still
Whilst throbs the tempest of my breast so high?
Can the fierce night-fiends rest on yonder hill,
And, in the eternal mansions of the sky,
Can the directors of the storm in powerless silence lie?
Hark! I hear music on the zephyr’s wing,
Louder it floats along the unruffled sky;
Some fairy sure has touched the viewless string--
Now faint in distant air the murmurs die.
Awhile it stills the tide of agony.
Now--now it loftier swells--again stern woe
Arises with the awakening melody.
Again fierce torments, such as demons know,
In bitterer, feller tide, on this torn bosom flow.
Arise ye sightless spirits of the storm,
Ye unseen minstrels of the aereal song,
Pour the fierce tide around this lonely form,
And roll the tempest's wildest swell along.
Dart the red lightning, wing the forked flash,
Pour from thy cloud-formed hills the thunder’s roar;
Arouse the whirlwind--and let ocean dash
In fiercest tumult on the rocking shore,--
Destroy this life or let earth's fabric be no more.
Yes! every tie that links me here is dead;
Mysterious Fate, thy mandate I obey,
Since hope and peace, and joy, for aye are fled,
I come, terrific power, I come away.
Then o'er this ruined soul let spirits of Hell,
In triumph, laughing wildly, mock its pain;
And though with direst pangs mine heart-strings swell,
I’ll echo back their deadly yells again,
Cursing the power that ne’er made aught in vain."
1258,Emotion,DespairPoemsDespairPoembyLeoYankevich,"Alone in the dark, the blood of blackberries
dripping down his shins, the morning star
looking back in the mirror through which he gazes,
moon-eyed and at odds with himself, he presses
his palms, but the nightmare doesn’t stop.
The sky turns and nothing this moment matters.
Not even the cold thorns of the blind wind
blowing hellward, not even the poisoned rainbow
that lights his prayers can give meaning to doubt.
The sullen belladonna that pricks his mind
will not comfort him in this final hour
and no guardian angel will come to touch his brow."

The worst, the World can wreak on me--the worst
That can make Life indifferent, yet disturb
With whisper'd Discontents the dying prayer--
I have beheld the whole of all, wherein
My Heart had any interest in this Life,
To be disrent and torn from off my Hopes
That nothing now is left. Why then live on ?
That Hostage, which the world had in it's keeping
Given by me as a Pledge that I would live--
That Hope of Her, say rather, that pure Faith
In her fix'd Love, which held me to keep truce
With the Tyranny of Life--is gone ah ! whither ?
What boots it to reply ? 'tis gone ! and now
Well may I break this Pact, this League of Blood
That ties me to myself--and break I shall !"

Every single day

And sending him away

But what does he want?
Is he here to stay?
Or just here to taunt?

1262,Emotion,DespairPoemsSongOfDespairPoembyPabloNeruda,"The memory of you emerges from the night around me.
The river mingles its stubborn lament with the sea.
Deserted like the wharves at dawn.
It is the hour of departure, oh deserted one!
Cold flower heads are raining over my heart.
Oh pit of debris, fierce cave of the shipwrecked.
In you the wars and the flights accumulated.
From you the wings of the song birds rose.
You swallowed everything, like distance.
Like the sea, like time. In you everything sank!
It was the happy hour of assault and the kiss.
The hour of the spell that blazed like a lighthouse.
Pilot's dread, fury of blind driver,
turbulent drunkenness of love, in you everything sank!
In the childhood of mist my soul, winged and wounded.
Lost discoverer, in you everything sank!
You girdled sorrow, you clung to desire,
sadness stunned you, in you everything sank!
I made the wall of shadow draw back,
beyond desire and act, I walked on.
Oh flesh, my own flesh, woman whom I loved and lost,
I summon you in the moist hour, I raise my song to you.
Like a jar you housed infinite tenderness.
and the infinite oblivion shattered you like a jar.
There was the black solitude of the islands,
and there, woman of love, your arms took me in.
There was thirst and hunger, and you were the fruit.
There were grief and ruins, and you were the miracle.
Ah woman, I do not know how you could contain me
in the earth of your soul, in the cross of your arms!
How terrible and brief my desire was to you!
How difficult and drunken, how tensed and avid.
Cemetery of kisses, there is still fire in your tombs,
still the fruited boughs burn, pecked at by birds.
Oh the bitten mouth, oh the kissed limbs,
oh the hungering teeth, oh the entwined bodies.
Oh the mad coupling of hope and force
in which we merged and despaired.
And the tenderness, light as water and as flour.
And the word scarcely begun on the lips.
This was my destiny and in it was my voyage of my longing,
and in it my longing fell, in you everything sank!
Oh pit of debris, everything fell into you,
what sorrow did you not express, in what sorrow are you not drowned!
From billow to billow you still called and sang.
Standing like a sailor in the prow of a vessel.
You still flowered in songs, you still brike the currents.
Oh pit of debris, open and bitter well.
Pale blind diver, luckless slinger,
lost discoverer, in you everything sank!
It is the hour of departure, the hard cold hour
which the night fastens to all the timetables.
The rustling belt of the sea girdles the shore.
Cold stars heave up, black birds migrate.
Deserted like the wharves at dawn.
Only tremulous shadow twists in my hands.
Oh farther than everything. Oh farther than everything.
It is the hour of departure. Oh abandoned one!"
1263,Emotion,DespairPoemsBeyondDespairPoembySarahLJohnsen,"I love the hours of misty morn
When clouds descend and kiss with dew

I love the hours of warm sunlight.
Your beauty is everything I see
And I feel you almost in my sight;
But your spectrum is a mystery.
I love the hour of magic light.
All colors are pleasing to the eye
While I think of you in seraph flight
Aureole, wings, in chromatic sky.
I love the hours of blissful night
And I feel you close in candlelight.
When I fall asleep you hold me tight.
With your love and hope, I greet the light."

At the shores

As the companion abandons
The new one is quick to embrace
Its heavenly bliss
To witness the sight
A magical touch
To forget the rest
Let,
The bygone footprints be bygone
Crumbled Abodes be orphaned
It's an infinite search
On an orbit of canvas
So much to unlearn
So much to unburden
Just in case,
Got queries to pose
Please reserve them for
The desert of despair"
1267,Emotion,DespairPoemsUncataloguedSmallActsOfDespairPoembyPattiMasterman,"It really bothers me when someone doesn't conclude their thought,
their eyes following something I can't quite make out yet.
From my vantage point, it's still up there somewhere, over the trees-
or caught up in them- something they deemed it necessary that I should know-
But then they stop, and they close their mouths; all unknowing,
or else in denial, that they left that kite just hanging uselessly
somewhere in the still opaque skies.
Children are pointing somewhere now, as it floats overhead,
an unmanned kite, of home and duration unknown.
The sun reflects mutely off it's bare bones and tensile membranes;
in imagination, an unseated kite can go on flying forever,
but like a blind or unpiloted aircraft, even its seconds
must be numbered.
And the unknown colors and possible direction haunts me,
like a deathbed confession, that never made it out
before the tongue froze forever to the palate.
Somewhere it's burning now, with a low flash of flame,
it's small jettison of fuel only a black smudge, against the horizon-
The treasure is lost; the disclosure never came-
no one was saved.
No one was saved."
1268,Emotion,DespairPoemsSomewhereAroundDespairPoembySofiulAzam,"for Sonja Broderick
'...the nameless pain from which one feels there can be no way out,
and one knows despair is absolute.'
- from The Mimic Men by V. S. Naipaul
1.
As I wait for the return of hopes and grace,
always I feel I shake with fears copulating
with each other faster than atoms in a chain reaction,
and all the nightmares of mimicry I have reaped
and stored so far in the granary of my mind
must have been planted
by the long lineage of my ancestors.
It's not that I am always up against them,
but I think I could have assured you:
I must be shopping around despair.
It seems as if it were made sure
the seedlings of despair I saw growing faster
get proper fertilizers and the rain.
I will reap a good harvest of despair soon.
2.
Life's not what it was before any more,
and could even be rejected by freshers
as something that only brings grief to the eager eyes -
no permanent release from all of my sighs.
It brings nothing but endless good-byes.
I know I won't stand up on the ground again.
3.
I wonder what the hell we always do
in living out our life like rats in the graveyard
or cockroaches in the discarded loft.
Every chance there is to fumble around despair.
Yes, I do feel despair is absolute,
aspirations never spill over into reality
as you might have seen from a glass
cold babbling wine falling onto the tablecloth.
4.
Rabbits we are in the roughest valley
where doom itself thrives,
always trying to scuttle far away,
feeling coldness rushing in our channels of blood,
just when hungry eagles swoop down on them
like the monsoon wind upon thatched cottages.
5.
Always we hear ear-blasting clatters of cars
clumsily crashing on the streets,
and terrific screams do chloroform us.
Yet, we all wake to another disaster
and find it's dark all around.
As darkness with the nightfall does
rain upon the life we make, I wonder
if such hours of dark luminosity
much longer than necessary
could measure the worth we bring
out of our conviction that's been
drab as a long-used copper coin,
a farrago of a Shakespearean clown's
nervous sanity and nonsense,
a kind of somber procrastination -
ghosts yet to be exorcized from a pristine chapel.
You know there's no ‘only other way around.'
This is simply our life in a snarl
where often dreams are deported
as if convicts of an old dynasty,
later guillotined before the party of nightmares,
where frailty and fright fraternize,
making our gaze shift from one muddy scene to another,
where downright convulsion is the whole caboodle.
Now curious news for numerous others:
in the abyss of deepest darkness
we are fighting this monstrous hybrid of despair
born not from a mother's womb;
and, of course, will wide jaws of the monster
be closing over us straight off;
later at dawn, we will soon be a lump of excrement
stinking among clusters of dewy grass.

'lost' in the shallowy depths of imagination.
i try my best not too scream,
as my heart had known nothin but elation.
i see u taking shade under a tree,
am not sure whether the drops comin out are your tears.
and i wish the one you were waiting for was me,
so that i can come and throw away your fears.
i wish i could come and stand by your side,
and make sure that you will never cry.
not taking care whether i am swept by any tide,
and makin sure that am always there to standing by.
am staring at the moon in the sky so blue,
am feeling that cold mist blowing on my face.
i wish the one next to me was you
right now and right here at this place
i want us to jump and soar the sky,
hand in hand watching the stars go by.
then i want to gift u that big fat moon,
not caring even if its a dumb stupid noon.
my love for u is like a chest made of gold,
i see your eyes ah! they're so bold.
when i think of you my heart's so cold.
these feelings i think i cant fold
i sometimes wish that i could feel your hand,
and before i realise they slip off like sand.
my dreams revolve around a person no matter what i do,
oh my love! that person is you.
this feeling i have never throws me down,
i have lost a heart that was never found.
long back i knew you as a good friend,
i knew you since i dont know when.
i sometimes find words hard to find,
thats probably because you are always on my mind
i think of you each and everyday,
i dont know why we are so far away.
thats probably why i hate god so much,
now you're someone i cant even touch.
the only thing i request you is to wait
i'll come and lift you before its too late
so what i say is when i dream,
i almost see you everywhere.
but when i wake up i often scream,
as i see you nowhere there.

Are two sides

Increase our deposits
And never try

Am I my body?
Well, Descartes explained, we are talking about
Two incompatible substances:
The unextended and indivisible mind
In contrast with the extended and divisible matter,
Res cogitans versus res extensa.
Yes, but am I my body?
How is the contact created
Between the mental
And the physical worlds?
Princess Elizabeth of the Palatinate asked.
Well, somewhere at the base of the brain,
In the pineal gland, replied the philosopher.
Oh, I have a problem with that,
The princess remarked.
For, if the brain exists in space,
How can the non-spatial mind dwell in it?
And Descartes threw up his hands
In despair."

Or the weather changes
Or some hurt goes away

Where to go leaving Thee,
Thou my sole hope?"
1284,Emotion,DespairPoemsOdeToDespairPoembyCharlotteSmith,"FROM THE NOVEL OF EMMELINE.
THOU spectre of terrific mien!
Lord of the hopeless heart and hollow eye,
In whose fierce train each form is seen
That drives sick Reason to insanity!
I woo thee with unusual prayer,
'Grim visaged, comfortless Despair:'
Approach; in me a willing victim find,
Who seeks thine iron sway--and calls thee kind!
Ah! hide for ever from my sight
The faithless flatterer Hope--whose pencil, gay,
Portrays some vision of delight,
Then bids the fairy tablet fade away;
While in dire contrast, to mine eyes,
Thy phantoms, yet more hideous, rise,
And Memory draws from Pleasure's wither'd flower,
Corrosives for the heart--of fatal power!
I bid the traitor Love adieu!
Who to this fond believing bosom came,
A guest insidious and untrue,
With Pity's soothing voice--in Friendship's name;
The wounds he gave, nor Time shall cure,
Nor Reason teach me to endure.
And to that breast mild Patience pleads in vain,
Which feels the curse--of meriting its pain.
Yet not to me, tremendous Power!
Thy worst of spirit-wounding pangs impart,
With which, in dark conviction's hour,
Thou strik'st the guilty unrepentant heart;
But of illusion long the sport,
That dreary, tranquil gloom I court,
Where my past errors I may still deplore,
And dream of long-lost happiness no more!
To thee I give this tortured breast,
Where Hope arises but to foster pain;
Ah! lull its agonies to rest!
Ah! let me never be deceived again!
But callous, in thy deep repose,
Behold, in long array, the woes
Of the dread future, calm and undismay'd,
Till I may claim the hope--that shall not fade!"
1285,Emotion,DespairPoemsInDespairPoembyMamtaAgarwal,"What is the world coming to?
Though carrying weapons is taboo
Children are happy totting the gun,
Whether to settle scores or just for fun.
When did innocence get lost and things changed?
It some how seems shocking and strange.
Too much T V, films is the reason
Reason elders for this violence and aggression.
Isn’t there lack of communication?
This has had deeper ramifications.
The young yearn for someone to share
Their confusion, but no one has time to spare.
If you are not there when your child needs you,
You will be the last to know what he brews
When he turns to his peers
To share his angst and fears.
A child is born out of a moment of ecstasy,
It is sad then you become too busy
To teach your child right from wrong,
And make him morally strong
Did you consider the likelihood
Of sacrifices you’ll have to make for parenthood?
And teach him to stand his ground
And not be bullied by any hound.
It is time to figure out
How to bring a turnabout.
In order to sort out this mess
Everyone has to try to impress
That none is above the law.
We have to overcome our flaws,
So our kids do not go astray.
Good sense prevails, I hope and pray.
Its already late
Don’t leave their future to chance and fate."
1286,Emotion,DespairPoemsTheSongOfDespairPoembyGertStrydom,"Somehow you are missing from my memory.
The night falls slowly, coming with tranquillity.
Deserted is our once happy home as you are gone,
my whole life has turned into stone.
You swallowed all our possessions, left an open door,
and only empty spaces on the wooden floor.
In your love I once was lost,
but your betrayal came at an extremely high cost.
You wanted me only for the body’s bliss
and went to a lover and that is the way that it is.
Too many times I had to draw curtains back,
in life and coming death change the ways that you did act.
Too many times as my wife
you were part of me, were too important in my life.
Now what was once ours fades to oblivion,
as life not ending just moves on and on.
This is the time of departure
when birds go to their nests in nature,
when to ashes wood in the fireplace burn,
when you left on a journey of no return.
Much too slowly this night moves on, once happy one."
1287,Emotion,DespairPoemsTheIronyOfDespairPoembyLaurenPhillips,"the silence breaks the noise;
dark and fearful
as shadows consume the light
and the sun that shown with radiance;
bright and guiding
has been swallowed by the night
tears stream from eyes;
sad and lonely
she reaches for the gun
screams are muted for the silence;
long and hopeless
made her decide her life was done
the single bullet in hand;
cold and silver
thinking the choice she's making is right
looking for the second bullet;
hurriedly and desperate
she thinks for a second: she never thought she might...
placing the pistol at her neck;
scared and shaking
soon of her life there would be none
the gun shot breaks the silence;
loud and echoing
with this, out from behind a cloud peeks the sun."
1288,Emotion,DespairPoemsARealDespairPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"I shall call on you not out of despair
I will be there when it has gone beyond repair
It won’t look in niceites and fair
It is definitely blown over  by air
I shall be on your side for all the times
It has been  witnessed  in recent times
You too stood for values and principles
I was always there as staunch disciples
The clouds were gathering storms
The relation was strained and not remaining warm
I could see great difficulty and  danger
It should not have been spoiled with anger
The shadow looming large over our relation
There was going to be big mark in question
How could I thwart off the situation?
It  still needed  some solace or evaluation
I was not expecting to do a wonder
But still I had many questions to ponder
I had lot more to do the good to the friendship
It was to remain in tact as companionship
I could emotionally hide my feeling
It was inwardly pinching and killing
I had earnest try to keep it in tact
This was to be the  centre core in fact
I would love to be on his side
The speculation was very wide
I had nothing to hold back or hide
There might have been some deviation slidr
I shall strive for nice spot
It may not be considered than big blot
We may blow some times cold or hot
The wordy dual is unnecssarily fought
I may still go for fair name
People may have no chance to blame
It will be nice and pefect bond
I always stood for it and was very much fond"
1289,Emotion,DespairPoemsTheBenchSeatedInDespairAfterJacquesPrevertPoembyMiroslavaOdalovic,"No willow tree to toss his hair
no paloma bianca in white to clad
this is the bench seated in despair
of creatures upon the earth widespread
of features upon the surface unsaid
he smiles at the crowds
the crowds go mad
he laughs at the clouds
in white to clad
and it's  a smile no one can bear
horrible laughter of a mutant pain
the customs at which there's nothing to declare
no belief no relief no grief
just a sky and a grin
despair is his sin"
1290,Emotion,DespairPoemsDespairPoembyDianeJimenez,"I look around me, and I'm in despair.
I glance at each and every corner
I feel so alone.
My wants and dreams for my children
Just one, be not in despair
Yet I see another one of my children
falling thoughts of my deadly despair,
getting nowhere, going nowhere.
This same vicious cycle.
Oh! Lord I must change this hurt that I have given
my children.
Lord! Help, help them to break this inheritance
to not fall upon their children.
Help me! for I'm in despair for happiness and
peace for my children.
They have tried to make a change,
from this grieving and despair, a peace of mind,
a will to make my days upon this grieving world
better.
If I could just make that one difference, I would
live much happier and peaceful."
1291,Emotion,DespairPoemsNoManCanCompassADespairPoembyEmilyDickinson,"477
No Man can compass a Despair—
As round a Goalless Road
No faster than a Mile at once
The Traveller proceed—
Unconscious of the Width—
Unconscious that the Sun
Be setting on His progress—
So accurate the One
At estimating Pain—
Whose own—has just begun—
His ignorance—the Angel
That pilot Him along—"

Falls on a world of chaos, and alone
I lie, and listen for the single string
Of Hope, with strainèd ears, but hear no moan
Nor any sound, save only the dull beat
Of my starved heart, that totters on the brink
Of abjectness, reason dethroned, her seat
Usurped by folly. Dear God! let me sink
Forever out of sight in nothingness,
As crazed stars fall from heaven. Woe is me!
Is death too merciful for my distress?
Or does my pain mean nothing unto Thee?
Life's stony road I've suffered passing well,
Now its lone sign-post points to my soul's hell."

1296,Emotion,DespairPoemsDespairPoembyMengJiao,"Despise poetry, and you'll be named to office.
But to love poetry is like clinging to a mountain:
frozen, holding tight, facing death,
days of sorrow followed by sorrow.
The bourgeoisie are jealous of those
who love poetry: they flash teeth like knives.
All the old sages are long since dead,
but bureaucrats still gnaw their bones.
Now I'm frail, dying like a frond.
All my life I sought a noble calm,
a calm I could never achieve.
And the noisy rabble mocked me."
1297,Emotion,AngerPoemsAngerPoembyLeslieRodriguez,"Anger threatens to steal me away
My soul burns with fire, my sanity strays
My heart beats faster, one single beat
My face reddens sudden from the intense heat
Anger came quickly
As quickly as can be
My thoughts think the worst just wanting to be free
It came so fast I can hardly remember
While my heart beats with rage and a sole burning ember
Anger fell upon me and tore me apart
My brain fries from the burn, from the hurt, from the start
I begin to wonder how much I can endure
As I ball up my hands struggling to gain composure
The storm swells up inside me and wears down everything like erosion
I know soon it will blow
Like a time bomb explosion
A giant volcano, about to blow up
The lava spilling over, ready to erupt
Anger reaches over to a boiling temperature
These feelings all too childish, irresponsible, immature
Anger threatens to take me away, my eyes now to blind
Everything seems red to me, the tint not all too kind
Anger spills out over, through every open space
Giving another memory, that never I can erase"
1298,Emotion,AngerPoemsAngerLindasStoryPoembyLonnieHicks,"There is this angry place
she said
that's been inside me since
my earliest days.
And when I  need
I go there
for power
and resistance.
If ever
someone
hurts me
I let it out
to go free
and kill
or hurt back
and allow
it to take retribution.
It makes me feel strong
It makes me feel not so weak.
Only thing
is it is starting to get out of control.
After getting out
sometimes
it will not go back in
It remains out
and hurt
some people
it shouldn't.
That's the thing
about this Anger
thing
I'm afraid
most times now.
I am not in control.
It is.
Now it is Scary Anger
and I blank out at times
to wake up
shocked to see
what it has done.
I need help with it."

1300,Emotion,AngerPoemsAngerPoembybriefrenderingsJoeFazio,"Anger, a spark, within all of us.
There, anger is lurking, waiting to
ignite the dynamite, that will
cause an explosion of words,
and actions, that can not be taken back.
Anger, is the roadblock, to anything
and everything, worthwhile in life.
Anger, seemingly an involuntary reaction,
to rejection of thought or action.
Anger, an interpretation, of unacceptable behavior.
Anger, almost always followed by regret.
Anger, an emotion. who's children are,
anxiety, fear, frustration, animosity, passion,
outrage and a thousands of other, emotionally
affecting articulations.
Anger, the replacement of reason.
What is the enemy of anger? The
enemy of anger, is, patience, understanding

far better off, without.

1301,Emotion,AngerPoemsAngerPoembyProfNiamatAliMurtazai,"Anger spreads poison in mind
Destruction it leaves behind.
It snatches all our senses
And increases all our expenses.
Bloody sword in its hands it keeps
And climbs up on thoughts bulky heaps.
It becomes blind in its darkness
Hatred it can only express.
It cuts and bites with nails and teeth
Thorns ae spread  in flowery heath.
It casts eclipse to sun and moon
But when is punctured its baloon
Often it sits with head on knees
And is heard saying ' please, please, please.'"
1302,Emotion,AngerPoemsAngerFindsAlwaysItsReasonsToBePoembyPattiMasterman,"Anger finds always its reasons to be,
And sometimes may use a more powerful voice
Than it really possesses; as birds fluff their feathers
In mock-deadly duels, when choosing a mate.
But anger too, has it's own place and time,
Though it is made weak, by continual use;
Like the hand always lingers, over the Queen
Feinting the win, in a tired game of chess.
If you would choose rightly, which to forget
And which to lose sleep, while it plots it's revenge,
The kind of anger that's best not ignored: the kind
Says no word; counting all your heartbeats."
1303,Emotion,AngerPoemsAngerAndJealousyPoembyFrancisDuggan,"Anger and jealousy are siblings both self destructive in their own way
Of the damage they give rise to we hear and read of every day
In assaults and murder and every violent sort of crime
So many people because of them in prison serving time
Anger and jealousy to assertiveness different in every way
That only does seem a fair thing to say
Those who are assertive speak with a clear mind
To outbursts of anger they are not inclined
Jealousy and anger out of control
Blocks out the light from the windows of the soul
Non human friendly that cannot be denied
Worse flaws by far than even arrogance and pride
To violence and crimes against others they do lead
Anger and jealousy are siblings indeed"
1304,Emotion,AngerPoemsAngerPoembyAshleyStone,"Inexplainable is her mood
Undescribable is her mood
No smile, no frown
Never up and never down
She's merely a body taking up space
Sucking in air, never changing her face
Starring in plain dismay
Aloof
Whenever you look upon her face
Anger is what you think
She doesn't smile and she doesn't shout
She simply stares filled with doubt
Questions run through her mind
Am I happy or am I mad?
Anger is what she should feel
After all she's been through
Instead,
She's just here"
1305,Emotion,AngerPoemsAngerRagesInsidePoembyAmyKerswell,"Anger is bubbling away at me.
Burning a whole in my heart.
Making me burn with rage.
I have good reason to be angry.
I only wish
I could make them pay.
Put them through
What they did to me.
Anger is destroying me.
For Im hell bent on revenge..
I would love to dish out.
My own justice.
But I cant.
Anger Buabbles away.
Like a swishing sound
Of the waves.
Like a brook babbles
Anger takes ahold."

I secreted in the darkness of my heart
I thought I hid it well from everyone’s view

A thick trunk no reason could uproot
Anger was just a seed when I forgot
To forgive and hid in my heart!"

That needs not even air
To propagate contagion

And burns a flaming red.

From destroying sensibilites
In that haze of its red mist."

Don't use it
With your thoughts
Don't amuse it
Don't feed it

Don't keep it
To the dark wells of your mind
You must lead it
Drown it
Supress it
Don't let it
Come up with
Mud and water
Don't let it closer.
You can't calm it
You can't teach it
Don't warm it
Burn it
When it hurts you
Hurt it
Reach it
But don't hold it
Try to fold it
Into shapes
Then throw it
In a jar
And brake it
Swallow the shreds
To taste it
Tastes better with your blood?
Waste it
Spit it out
And keep it out
Watch it
But don't touch it.
You can't bear it
You can't take it
You can't make it
Weaker.
It speaks for itself, speaker
It eats for itself, eater
Catcher and coveter
Not seeker."

To go and never look back
You feel that you hate people
And you hate yourself

But you want to punish yourself
To broke every thing that make you happy
And you want to be in the cage of sadness forever
You think all these things when you are angry
Your brain tell you that you are wrong but your heart want to explose...
But after few time you'll forget
And you'll be stronger than you were
And finally you realize that you learnt many things and your belief in God has increased
Which give you the power to fly...to reach be on the sky
And you'll know that everywhere you go God will protect you
Just trust..."

This outlook I have you needs to say the same
I love you deep down inside
I wish you would see
That you’re the only princess for me
The anger I have deep in side
Comes out when I least expect it
This anger I have in me should just go away
This anger I have is an annoyance
This anger I have has messed my life up
This anger I have is stupid
Anger you have messed up my marriage
Anger you have messed up my life
Anger you have destroyed who I am inside and out
Anger you are the devil
Anger you are all that is bad
This anger I have in me has made me fight
A fight that was not worth it

Anger you made me do the wrong things
Anger you are the feeling that I would never miss
Anger you have caused me so much sorrow
Anger you have caused nothing but grief.

Violence burns within me;
A potent drug, rage.

The mountain's height:

Pitiful worm.
I am danger incarnate:
Death personified.
Be thankful I am sane,
And controlled;
-Bottled anger-
If I were not,
You would cease to be."

I keep it all inside

For If I lose it all

It keeps coming back
For it is my sin
It's burned in me
It haunts me day & night
Carved into my core
It is my only sight
It's the only thing I know
It's all that is me
It's the only emotion I show
I wish I could be free

Anger, borne of dry desire

When tamed, a friendly flame
That fuels the vision
To fight for the right.

1316,Emotion,AngerPoemsGnawingAngerPoembyKentHolman,"She sat looking at me,
Not listening to a word.
Every time we talked, she
Said my opinion was absurd—
You should have seen my face;
The anger I showed was a disgrace.
For years, I have lived with such anger,
Gnawing anger, the kind that lingers
Like roadkill. To be sure, I am not stranger
To rage. Its long bony fingers
Have touched my heart many times,
Urging me to commit heinous crimes.
But to blame anyone for my rage is unjust.
No one is responsible for my fury,
Though I may think so, my eyesight is simply blurry
Anger is seeking a new slave;
As for me, I’d rather be brave,
Before anger puts me deep down in a grave."
1317,Emotion,AngerPoemsAngerAndFrustrationPoembyDavidHarris,"Sometimes we get angry
over the silliest of things,
but it is not anger,
but frustration
over something we cannot do.
If we could have done it,
there would have
been no anger there.
There is no easy solution
to get over it.
It is part of our nature
I am afraid to say.
The sad thing is
it will never go away.
We will always suffer the frustration
and the anger that goes with it.

I don't understand what you say -
One minute you're glad
The next one you're mad
I feel like I'm treading thin ice;
You constantly throw me off balance,
I hold my affection in check -
And then in a minute
You smile, and you win it
I feel like I'm losing my mind;
Why do you make me so angry?
Why do I feel so uptight?
I so want to please you
Instead I just tease you
And then we end up in a fight;
So why don't we just change the game plan,
Agree to be lovers instead -
And when there's an issue
We'll just grab the tissue
And make anger so sweetly in bed!
For my special friend - 'THANK YOU'"

Anger,
is like,
having a  burning coal,

1323,Emotion,AngerPoemsDepressionIsAngerWithoutEnthusiasmPoembysimplyhere,"I read this quote
“Depression is anger without enthusiasm.”
I don’t believe that for a second,
I think depression is loneliness,
Feeling so lonely inside
Even if the world surrounds you
And knowing you cant blame anyone but yourself
But that’s just me.
And even worse
When the people you’d think know you best,
Don’t even notice.
Depression to me is
An overwhelming feeling
of defeat
Feeling that somehow,
In a game, you verses life
You lose
And there is no
Double or nothing
Or a such thing as re-do’s
Some of us accept it
And try other strategies
Others are left
Only to dwell
On what tactics they could have changed."
1324,Emotion,AngerPoemsAngerDoesNotPayPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"Anger is red danger
But a familiar stranger
So It came as no surprise
At the times I have paid the price
More than the usual thrice
Before becoming very wise
The judge said
I should have been put in a cage
If one considers all the damage
I brought on with my rage
I knew
My anger was unreasonable
My anger was invincible
My anger was uncontrollable
But still very reversible
You see
In anger I always surrender
To the pressure I am under
In anger, I ungraciously lose
To the one I righteously accuse
In anger, I immoderately protest
Instead of letting things rest
Then trying responsibly to digest
And deal with issues best
So I say, So I say
Anger does not pay
Anger does not stay
Delay it from display
In time it will only go away
Now I know that
Anger does not pay
Anger does not stay
Calmness you should play
Before you begin to fall astray

every minute the fire burns brighter,
time is ticking,
waiting to see who will be on the other side of this raging flame,
waiting to see what will happen to people who mess with me,
this fire is on raging so hot i cannot put it out,
only in your preasence does it fade away,

the fires take me,
time can only tell what this great anger will cause me to do next,
even the best,
are no better than the rest,
you can wish for it to disapear all you like,
but nothing you try,
will even compare to the firery anger and deep dispair,

to release it into the pits of hell where it came from.."

They were conceived within you
They were nourished, nurtured,
fostered and brought up by you.
High time you realized that
these fiends are your own children
And still not too late to hold them by nose,
provided you have the desire, commitment ‘n courage.
They all are fiends within you
Controlling them, is your baby
No one else in the whole universe
Could or would do that for you."

Even if Your angry all day,
Even if You want quiet time alone,
Or possibly time away from home,
Don't Let the Sun go down on Your anger! ! !
Don't Let anger take hold of You,
That You don't know what You do!
Pray! Right away! Jesus is waiting to hear! !
Tell Him all about it! No Reason to fear!
Than all Your anger will disappear! ! !
Ask Jesus for Forgiveness Immediately! ! !
For the anger that You displayed
To No Longer have anger in Your Heart
So, It won't become a part of You, Everyday! ! !
When Jesus was Upon the Cross! ! !
He said 'Father Forgive Them!
For they do Not no what they do! '
Always Love One another! Forgive All Others!
Just Like Our Father Forgave Me and You! !
Follow Jesus Steps! It's God's Request! ! !

1332,Emotion,AngerPoemsNaturesAngerPoembyFrancisDuggan,"Great buildings before her have toppled like dominos
She made them look as fragile as a castle of sand
Built on the beach by children in the morning
And washed out to sea when the tide floods the strand.
Anything humans do build cannot withstand her anger
The strongest of structures from their foundations she shake
Compared to her we are just tiny insects
There is nothing we can build that she cannot break.
We who are arrogant do not respect her
Though in her bosom we are destined to lay
There is no greater force than Mother Nature
On life and death she has the final say.
There is some price to pay for our pollutants
Our polluting of oceans, waterways and land
Little we seem to know of Mother Nature
And little of her ways we do understand.
On ourselves we invite the anger of Nature
She can shake to rubble our mightiest towers
Yet she can be gentle the one we live off of
And we see her great beauty in her blossoms and flowers."
1333,Emotion,AngerPoemsAngerPoembyTissaCalvert,"Anger is the devil inside our locked up souls,
Anger is the spirit in which I with hold,
Angers the such demond who never is told,
Anger is which never ever grows old.
Anger is a lie when someone's in trouble,
Anger is always there on the double,
That's what anger is!"
1334,Emotion,AngerPoemsAngerPoembyDavinaCaddell,"His anger is a hard summer storm,
Unpredictable and uncontrollable
Like the rain his anger falls upon countless victims.
Like the wind his anger lashes out upon the innocent
Like a summer storm his anger comes
And like a summer storm his anger goes.
It leaves behind destruction and kayos
Dismay and suffering.
His anger comes and it goes
And with all brings, It causes only pain."

Why do you want me to go?
Where am I so supposed to be?
With you all I want to do is scream
Why do you have to be so mean?
Well I don’t care anymore
I will hate you to the core
Can you handle my anger in my mind?
Or will it kill you as I watch you die
And I will never cry."
1337,Emotion,AngerPoemsAngerPoembyRatanBhattacharjee,"Anger is a hydra -headed demon
A demon beating its  furious wings
a volcano belching out  fiery lava
a gloomy sky cracking thunders
a CSTC bus rushing on a smoky road
in the wintry evening
Anger is emptiness or losing
A girl being robbed of her angelic infancy
a nonagenarian mother denied her home
a lost child crying for its parents in the crowded local train
a child that loses her doll
Anger is the foamy sea writhing with pain
The sea that rolls its waves to knock the barge
Or the sapless champak losing its  petals
Or a hilly town without the snowfall
Or on a fuzzy vista a lonely bird calls
Or when I cannot write a single line
Anger comes to me
I become really angry"
1338,Emotion,AngerPoemsAngerPoembyCharlesLamb,"Anger in its time and place
May assume a kind of grace.
It must have some reason in it,
And not last beyond a minute.
If to further lengths it go,
It does into malice grow.
'Tis the difference that we see
'Twixt the serpent and the bee.
If the latter you provoke,
It inflicts a hasty stroke,
Puts you to some little pain,
But it never stings again.
Close in tufted bush or brake
Lurks the poison-swellëd snake
Nursing up his cherished wrath;
In the purlieux of his path,
In the cold, or in the warm,
Mean him good, or mean him harm,
Whensoever fate may bring you,
The vile snake will always sting you."
1339,Emotion,AngerPoemsALoversAngerPoembyMatthewPrior,"As Cloe came into the Room t'other Day,
I peevish began; Where so long cou'd You stay?
In your Life-time You never regarded your Hour:
You promis'd at Two; and (pray look Child) 'tis Four.
A Lady's Watch needs neither Figures nor Wheels:
'Tis enough, that 'tis loaded with Baubles and Seals.
A Temper so heedless no Mortal can bear—
Thus far I went on with a resolute Air.
Lord bless Me! said She; let a Body but speak:
Here's an ugly hard Rose-Bud fall'n into my Neck:
It has hurt Me, and vext Me to such a Degree—
See here; for You never believe Me; pray see,
On the left Side my Breast what a Mark it has made.
So saying, her Bosom She careless display'd.
That Seat of Delight I with Wonder survey'd;
And forgot ev'ry Word I design'd to have said."
1340,Emotion,AngerPoemsAngerPoembyAdensKamwi,"The anger that i feel seems to steal my only joy,
boy! i can't imagine another emotion that erupts into motion,
as quickly as eyes see a floppin' bee.
Anger is a traitor false like a frequent masturbator,
it hides between the lies that materialise between our lips,
if hips don't lie, than do eyes not cry?
Why I wonder do we anger ourselves in ways that prevent days from being ablazed with happy thoughts as preachers taught,
'the sinner will rot in a burning pot' so... is it anger or are we always in danger wether it is September or December?
Is it any wonder that we gather this useless treasure in banks and ignore the noisey tanks that run in Afghanistan or Iran.
Do we prefer to remain ablure of anger?
This emotion, the iron curtain that is certain to pain any person
that chooses to inherit it's possessions that of war, hunger and pestilence, that of scare, dishonor and sins.
So let anger not be amongst You for You will have no clue of how to unglue it's curse. It get's worse with every passing second,
minute and hour. Time takes no shower!
It is a constant power that blooms the flower and melts your butter, so let anger fly and send a taunt to it's reply, ' I, I will not die'"
1341,Emotion,AngerPoemsAngerRagesInsidePoembyAmyLouiseKerswell,"Anger is bubbling away at me.
Burning a whole in my heart.
Making me burn with rage.
I have good reason to be angry.
I only wish
I could make them pay.
Put them through
What they did to me.
Anger is destroying me.
For Im hell bent on revenge..
I would love to dish out.
My own justice.
But I cant.
Anger Buabbles away.
Like a swishing sound
Of the waves.
Like a brook babbles
Anger takes ahold."

I prefer to be at peace
I go away from present danger
and my problems begin to cease
But I grieve, for it cannot last
My anger refuses to be ignored
Painful memories from the past
Have become a ruler and a lord
They rule over my mind with brute force
I cannot help but to cry
Of actions they cause I have much remorse
Because of these crimes, I deserve to die
Anger trapped within
has become my torture, my sorrow, my sin"
1345,Emotion,AngerPoemsAngerPoembyLindaMoore,"Don't make a scene, Refrain
Angry words march through the brain
Mouth clamped shut as not to utter
Quivering body, quaking shutter
Rushing sound in the ears
Eyes blinded, wet hot tears
Furious fists, clench and flex
Out of control, mind forms the text
Pent up, overflowing, ready to implode
Rapid fire has them spent, now words reload
Body turns to walk away
Conscious of the futility to stay
The breath sucked in now released
Personal Power, tenfold increased
Anger tries to take its toll
Beaten by control"
1346,Emotion,AngerPoemsAngerAndForgivenessIiPoembyRayAndrews,"When I am full of anger
I think in anger's terms
Part of my existing life
Is full of anger's germs
Nothing seems a perfect right
Most of things gone wrong
I get such vengeful feelings
When I carry anger along
When I think of forgiveness
I think in forgiveness' terms
My life is held in gentle hands
Softly in those twists and turns
Very few are perfect wrongs
So many things are right
Show me God forgiveness' face
So I can live in light"

There, anger is lurking, waiting to
ignite the dynamite, that will
cause an explosion of words,
and actions, that can not be taken back.
Anger, is the roadblock, to anything
and everything, worthwhile in life.
Anger, seemingly an involuntary reaction,
to rejection of thought or action.
Anger, an interpretation, of unacceptable behavior.
Anger, almost always followed by regret.
Anger, an emotion. who's children are,
anxiety, fear, frustration, animosity, passion,
outrage and a thousands of other, emotionally
affecting articulations.
Anger, the replacement of reason.
What is the enemy of anger? The
enemy of anger, is, patience, understanding

1348,Emotion,AngerPoemsAngerPoembyMamtaAgarwal,"Your anger
Bursts like a thunderstorm,
And torrential rain,
And flashes like lightening.
And when its spent
And an uncanny calm descends.
I feel like an uprooted tree.
Sharp words
Can hurt,
Deeper than a wound
By a sword.
It takes time
Before a scab forms,
And you move on."
1349,Emotion,AngerPoemsAngerAndPatiencePoembyPattiMasterman,"Any time I don't understand something
Or feel unhappy with the way things are going,
Anger steps up, 'use me; let me help'
And I used to give Anger a lot of free rein,
Till I noticed Anger wasn't all that useful
And generally tended to only make things worse.
Now I try to rely more on 'Patience'
As Patience doesn't keep clicking that counter,
Adding up every resentment of the hour.
Besides, I can look straight into Patience's face
And not have one clue what Patience is thinking of.
You know, Anger could learn something from that."

I blow up and I don’t know why

This outlook I have on life needs to change
This outlook I have you needs to say the same
I love you deep down inside
I wish you would see
That you’re the only princess for me
The anger I have deep in side
Comes out when I least expect it
This anger I have in me should just go away
This anger I have is an annoyance
This anger I have has messed my life up
This anger I have is stupid
Anger you have messed up my love for you
Anger you have messed up my life
Anger you have destroyed who I am inside and out
Anger you are the devil
Anger you are all that is bad
This anger I have in me has made me fight
A fight that was not worth it
Anger you made me hit the wrong person
Anger you made me do the wrong things
Anger you are the feeling that I would never miss
Anger you have caused me so much sorrow
Anger you have caused nothing but grief.
Anger just go away

issue ofmine
borne with love,
birthed with care;
i look at you now
the naughty gleam in your eye,
as your worrisome ministrations
wreck havoc with all order.
i look and marvel
at the miracle of your evolution..
from gurgles to mumbles
and thence to comprehensions;
the actions with anger
tempered by the pouts
which dissolve my resolution to be firm.
you, little bundle of joy and woe
all atwitter in a fit of
infantile anger..
i look at you, bewildered
marvelling, as a mother
at what God had me do!
inspired by my year half old daughter who has the strange power to drive me to tears and then be smiling thru them as she licks my face like a little loving poodle!"
1353,Emotion,AngerPoemsTheCausesOfAngerAndItsMedicinePoembyAlGhazaliAbuHamid,"Know, O dear readers, that the medicine of a disease is to remove the
root cause of that disease. Isa (Jesus Christ) -peace be upon him-
was once asked: 'What thing is difficult?' He said: 'God's wrath.'
Prophet Yahya (John the Baptist) -peace be upon him- then asked:
'What thing takes near the wrath of God?' He said:'Anger'. Yahya -
peace be upon him- asked him:'What thing grows and increases anger?'
Isa -peace be upon him- said:'Pride, prestige, hope for honour and
haughtiness'
The causes which cause anger to grow are self-conceit, self-praise,
jests and ridicule, argument, treachery, too much greed for too much
wealth and name and fame. If these evils are united in a person, his
conduct becomes bad and he cannot escape anger.
So these things should be removed by their opposites. Self-praise is
to be removed by modesty. Pride is to be removed by one's own origin
and birth, greed is to be removed by remaining satisfied with
necessary things, and miserliness by charity.
The prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: 'A strong man is not
he who defeats his adversary by wrestling, but a strong man is he who
controls himself at the time of anger.'
We are describing below the medicines of anger after one gets angry.
The medicine is a mixture of knowledge and action. The medicine based
on knowledge is of six kinds:
(1) The first medicine of knowledge is to think over the rewards of
appeasing anger, that have come from the verses of the Quran and the
sayings of the Prophet (pbuh). Your hope for getting rewards of
appeasing anger will restrain you from taking revenge.
(2) The second kind of medicine based on knowledge is to fear the
punishment of God and to think that the punishment of God upon me is
greater than my punishment upon him. If I take revenge upon this man
for anger, God will take revenge upon me on the Judgement Day.
(3) The third kind of medicine of anger based on knowledge is to take
precaution about punishment of enmity and revenge on himself. You
feel joy in having your enemy in your presence in his sorrows, You
yourself are not free from that danger. You will fear that your enemy
might take revenge against you in this world and in the next.
(4) Another kind of medicine based on knowledge is to think about the
ugly face of the angry man, which is just like that of the ferocious
beast. He who appeases anger looks like a sober and learned man.
(5) The fifth kind of medicine based on knowledge is to think that the
devil will advise by saying: ' You will be weak if you do not get
angry!' Do not listen to him!
(6) The sixth reason is to think: ' What reason have I got to get
angry? What Allah wishes has occurred!'
Medicine based on action
When you get angry, say: I seek refuge in God from the accursed evil
(A'oudhou billaahi min as shaytaan ir rajeem). The prophet (pbuh)
ordered us to say thus.
When Ayesha (RA) got angry, he dragged her by the nose and said: ' O
dear Ayesha, say: O God, you are the Lord of my prophet Muhammad,
forgive my sins and remove the anger from my heart and save me from
misguidance.'
If anger does not go by this means, you will sit down if you are
standing, lie down if you are sitting, and come near to earth, as you
have been created of earth. Thus make yourself calm like the earth.
The cause of wrath is heat and its opposite is to lie down on the
ground and to make the body calm and cool.
The prophet (pbuh) said: Anger is a burning coal. Don't you see your
eyebrows wide and eyes reddish? So when one of you feels angry, let
him sit down if standing, and lie down if sitting.
If still anger does not stop, make ablution with cold water or take a
bath, as fire cannot be extinguished without water.
The prophet (pbuh) said : ' When one of you gets angry, let him make
ablution with water as anger arises out of fire.' In another
narration, he said:' Anger comes from the devil and the devil is made
of fire.'
Hazrat Ali (RA) said:
The prophet did not get angry for any action of the world. When any
true matter charmed him, nobody knew it and nobody got up to take
revenge for his anger. HE GOT ANGRY ONLY FOR TRUTH."
1354,Emotion,AngerPoemsAngerPoembyDICKSONMSETI,"It’s a source of revenge,
Master of destruction,
It brings separation,
Encourage discrimination,
The source of pain,
Brings slavery,
Yeah, mental slavery.
Emotion is the enemy of facts,
Feelings is the darkness of reality,
Emotions, feelings are the wrong way of decision,
Let Anger not be the source of decision making,
Focus on the truth, reality and facts."
1355,Emotion,AngerPoemsAngerPoembyKevinFisher,"Shut up, go cry

Never show your face again."

1359,Emotion,AngerPoemsBeSlowToAngerPoembyLindaWinchell,"Be slow to anger
And  much quicker to love.
God didn't make mankind
To hate, hurt and our neighbors begrudge.
He gave each of us the holiest of gifts
Something we all posses.
And in our hearts, is where God’s love does its best.
So when you feel your anger building up inside
Go and give it to God, let in Him there reside.
His love is sufficient for all you see
He lives inside of you and me.
To bring mankind hope, joy and love
He gives it freely, from His Father God above.
It will smoother out any of anger's wrath
He will beat it up with the Holiest of bats!
He will beat it down, deep into the ground
So far, that your anger my friend
Will never again, ever be found."
1360,Emotion,AngerPoemsAngerSpeaksPoembyJasonSummers,"I'm not even going to say a word.
My mind compels me to speak, but for what?
So I can angrily express something absurd?
I can deal with it on my own instead of getting my throat cut.
I'm not even going to say a word.
Many thoughts of what to say spark here and there
Maybe if I try telling someone I can be heard.
If I don't react some way I won't get anywhere.
I'm not even going to say a word.
Yes, I make mistakes and I will own them
And time after time I'd correct them if I could
Because I know anger does not make them stem.
So now I'm saying this
For the simple fact for myself
All I need is to relax and rest
So I don't hurt myself or someone else.

1361,Emotion,AngerPoemsAngerLayByMePoembyElizabethDaryush,"Anger lay by me all night long,
His breath was hot upon my brow,
He told me of my burning wrong,
All night he talked and would not go.
He stood by me all through the day,
Struck from my hand the book, the pen;
He said: ‘Hear first what I’ve to say,
And sing, if you’ve the heart to, then.’
And can I cast him from my couch?
And can I lock him from my room?
Ah no, his honest words are such
That he’s my true-lord, and my doom."
1362,Emotion,AngerPoemsAngerMyEnemyOrMyFriendPoembyangelynagudo,"Anger is my enemy
There is a plenty of anger inside of me
I have to control it now but I don’t know how
My anger is part of my frustration
It fades my concentration in my ambition
It causes me plenty of trouble
It makes my life horrible
Anger form fears in my heart
It makes me broken apart
My body shakes with anger
It will not stop forever
I feel like I’m alone in this world
Nobody say to me any word
But the anger inside of me becomes my friend
It will never leave me till the end
My anger doesn’t leave me
It’s always there inside of me"

It stays deep within me.
I think about what is lost,

Every where I look,
I see what should be mine.
Envy turns to anger,
I think to myself 'who are these people? ,
they do not deserve such a thing I have lost'
I think about what is lost,
and the anger rises inside of me.
It rises to such a degree,
that anger turns to tears."

to things unable and things hard to find;
impatience is a virtue to its clogging kind
penetrating hearts of stone in boldness clime!
So much is painful in tumultous cover
where a depiction in eyes is hard to share;
all things but mellow of malicious iniquity
no wonder t’is world has its fullness agony.
A shaky change have its all-time poll
where swaggarts and mighty wolves enbrawl;
vultures feast its long time hunger’s fare
even those scattered bones in desert fire.
Or you may hear a shady battlecry from afar
Where brawling muscles smite a bloody howl;
No tempest wave can stop a sweltering blow
Only the noblest shadow hide a warrior show!
The zenith of fame serve a bounty swinger;
Killed a few but pain has its beehive’s anger
No love is felt nor a tortous whims appear,
hideous heart conquers an unwitting snare."

1368,Emotion,AngerPoemsangerMyFaithfulFriendPoembyPamThomas,"Anger, my faithful friend, never relenting, embedded in the
pit of my soul, ready to strike when fate and foe deal
their dreaded blows. Embracing you I have, all of my
life, drawing courage and strength in the face of pain.
I’ve been shunned by some, chastised by many when you
reared your ugly little head, but if not for your defense I
would have surely drowned in self defeat. In lack of
self responsibilities when inflicting their pain, my
foes have said, (Anger managment is what she needs) .
I pushed you away my friend, accepting the guilt from
others when clinging to you in times of trouble, but
as I picked my beat and bloody self up one day I
realized it was not my guilt but theirs that I took that
pushed you away.
Many have said that my friend is bad, but I say that
my friend is a gift,  so I could stand with courage and defend.
For God told of the sorrows in this life and knew
you would sustain me till the end. I thank  you

Don't languor
under the name of 'soft'
or 'sensitive.'
Just explode.
It's what you do best.
Curse and swear,
go spare,
put the dagger in
if you dare

Don't spare the pain.
Do it again
and again
and AGAIN.
But not with me......."
1374,Emotion,AngerPoemsAngerPoembySarahIbrahim,"Here I am again
having the same old pain
That same old Stupid Thing
Came along and started to Sting
Inside my room
I drowned in air of gloom
lost my self to the floor
Anger is kicking at my heart's door
The urge to break anything
whatever near me I'll start to swing
Hoping that I can Drive away
Whatever makes sadness song  play
How many time did I cry? ?
and hoped I could run away and fly? ?
Every time I spread my wings
That Horrible voice starts to sing
And it starts to pull me in
But I don't want to give in
Im Sick of Living like this
Taking Life the way it is
I don't want to lose my self anymore
I have the strength to fight im sure
I'll Hold my fists Tight
I will start the Fight
and I will Ride the Chances Flight"
1375,Emotion,AngerPoemshisAngerPoembyElizabethTyeaseCollins,"There he was positioned in front of the
reflection and through the eyes he senses
the hint of anger.
As he stares he yells,
hands clenched and his voice booming
through the walls of his room.
He yells at his stupidity and his insanity,
of his depression restraining him whole,
he yells at the reflection that's in his way
of what he really was.
Every word he's yelled he's inflicted
on his kids,
every dropp of anger led from abuse he's installed
upon marks of misery on his own flesh and blood.
He points a finger at this madman that stands before him
pointing back,
and tells him that he's nothing,
that his anger is overpowering everything that
he use to be,
that with all the people he should blame
for his unhappiness it should be him
His eyes tell a story of a lonely little
boy inside his depressing heart,
now a grown man with kids of his own and still
he yells in fright.
This battle on his own is slowly wearing down,
because inside he's losing what he had,
that even his daughter at sixteen can't deal with his
prescence being around her because he's so sad.
So he looks with the anger through his eyes he's dead,
but inside he's still that little kid,
so when he burns all his bridges down,
he's gonna be by himself instead.
Touchy subject but I wrote it because of my father.
Thank you for reading."

1377,Emotion,AngerPoemsControllingAngerBeforeItControlsYouPoembyMamtaAgarwal,"When toxic and volatile emotions
Are causing confusion and commotion,
Feelings are hijacked, hot thoughts race,
Mind gets enveloped in a rage.
As a consequence, visibility comes down,
It’s wise to shift gears and slow down.
Switch on the wipers
And clear the fog on the mind’s mirror.
Lest you forever live to regret
And wonder how I met with an accident.
Take few deep breaths, and count to ten,
As anger clouds the perception.
Your ability to discern goes haywire
So whatever you say backfires.
First deal with your inner pollution,
To stop firing deadly ammunition.
Remove yourself from the object of your ire
Lest you shoot arrows of fire
And give in to your primitive instinct,
Do something that your mood uplifts.
When the fog finally lifts
You’ll realise, perception does shift.
Then you’ll be glad
Things didn’t get out of hand.
Anger is our worst enemy
Causes havoc in our life and body chemistry."
1378,Emotion,AngerPoemsNotFromThisAngerPoembyDylanThomas,"Not from this anger, anticlimax after
Refusal struck her loin and the lame flower
Bent like a beast to lap the singular floods
In a land strapped by hunger
Shall she receive a bellyful of weeds
And bear those tendril hands I touch across
The agonized, two seas.
Behind my head a square of sky sags over
The circular smile tossed from lover to lover
And the golden ball spins out of the skies;
Not from this anger after
Refusal struck like a bell under water
Shall her smile breed that mouth, behind the mirror,
That burns along my eyes."
1379,Emotion,AngerPoemsSonnetOnAngerPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"Remember Man that Anger is futile!
Restrain your temper bad when ‘fumes’ arise;
Apologize if guilty, in high style,
And write your Anger off or play it nice.
Mere counting helps to dissipate Anger;
But slamming doors and raving mad aren’t right;
Poetry puts the ‘plane’ into hanger!
When Anger comes, Man loses his insight.
The more you write, the stinging tone gets less;
The balls you smash will fall away off-court;
Painting, cartooning help Anger harness;
Just hold your temper making it your forte!
An action rash in angry mood too fails;
When calm returns, a better sense prevails.

And I decided everything came to an end
I was irate for no reason
I acted as if my choice was treason
He sat with me like everyday
But today we did not talk or play
I avoided him as much as I could
Because I was angry with him, my friend
He tried to solve things out
By having a little spout
I turned my face away
Because I was angry with him, my friend
All his tries were in vain
He was true but I took it feign
Whatever so, I shunned him
Because I was angry with him, my friend
A friend or foe, now I thought
It baffled my mind, a doubt
But I bored him, ignored him
Because I was angry with him, my friend
What if I heard him through out?
Wouldn’t our fury be hindered?
Then we would still be friends
I should listen to him, my friend
He said words of fret and regret
He said of defense and confusion
He was a sad, mad lad
I forgave him all at once
He was my friend after all!

Nearly killed me for asking the loan of a glass of beer:
May the devil grip the whey-faced slut by the hair,
And beat bad manners out of her skin for a year.
That parboiled imp, with the hardest jaw you will see
On virtue’s path, and a voice that would rasp the dead,
Came roaring and raging the minute she looked on me,
And threw me out of the house on the back of my head!
If I asked her master he’d give me a cask a day;
But she, with the beer at hand, not a gill would arrange!
May she marry a ghost and bear him a kitten, and may
The High King of Glory permit her to get the mange."

Sometimes it is difficult for me to control my anger"

Is weight upon soul

It burns inside, and you feel it
But you not listening to your reasoning
Nor paying attention to your past
Let go, would be easy
But you hold on, like its priceless
If there is anyone loosing
That person would be you
Common, enjoy the freedom
And see the people smiling
If the eye, a window to the soul
Then anger,  a veil over the eyes
Get those rocks off your feet
Lift up those veil off your eyes
Let your true self reveal
The beauty you hold inside"

ANGER IS WHAT I FEEL WHEN I'M NEAR YOU'"
1388,Emotion,AngerPoemsMyAngerPoembylindseyashton,"A twisted fear of my own emotions, my tortured temper raises,
Piercing screams, contorted thoughts, haunted by angered faces.
They race around my confused mind, and strangle all that’s sane,
They take the anger to my hand and force me to inflict pain.
My anger feeds on my tears and when its full it is ready,
Racing through my pounding veins, taking over my body.
The screams are getting louder, my veins are pumping hard,
My anger is taking over, it leaves me feeling scared.
I take the blade to my sweating skin and slowly begin to cut,
Not deep enough to reach my veins, but deep enough to hurt.
I can feel the anger flowing, trickling down my arm,
Slowly cutting into my skin, I’m beginning to feel calm.
As my anger lessens, my head begins to ache,
This fully active anger is more than I can take.
My arms display my minds illness, and still no one can see,
What my haunted, twisted mind is forever doing to me.
Once the blood dries on my arms, my anger lays to rest,
Soaking up all my tears to once again put me to the test.
My mind is now hollow and empty, all has gone away,
Though my anger is no longer here, my thoughts are still astray.
Now I’m left with nothing, I feel so numb and alone,
Not having any thoughts at all, I lay here on my own.
Its going to come back and get me, I just don’t know when,
Its going to come and take over my mind and my arms again.
The anger is part of who I am and with me it wants to stay.
No one can make me better, no one can take it away,
It wont let you take it from me, it will hide from you, you’ll see,
Then when you think that I’m ok, it will come back for me.
Don’t try to understand me, I don’t expect you to,
I just want you to help me, be there when I need you,
Forgive me when I cannot smile, sit with me when I can’t speak,
Hold out your hand to me when I am feeling weak.
I understand if you cant do this, but please don’t then tell me its ok,
Because my anger is getting stronger and will get me for good one day."

I have to control it now
My anger causes me plenty of trouble
There is plenty of anger inside of me

Anger is a strong feeling of displasure
It is a grief that I have inside of me
How can I control it?
What triggers my anger?
Can I recognize it?"

So close to exploding
I am so close to the edge
No second thoughts before knowing
My body shakes with anger
The line is so close
Slowly starting to overstep that line
My eyes start to tear up
Softly falling down my cheeks
Anger invades me
Precisely and carefully taking over
Anger...Anger...Anger
The human passion that can help or destroy me
I feel like I'm alone in this small world
But the anger becomes my friend
My body crumbles to the ground
I wake up screaming
My mother comes to rock me to sleep."

Seeing anger in your face
Stomping on the floor
As you start to make a disgrace
You fist against the wall
Forming cracks as you hit
Your temper isn't all
Your mind just seems to flip
You become a different person
A person who's unknown
You make people tense
Whenever you come to show
We would prefer to stay away
Not follow in your tracks
Your temper's not okay
Because your anger's in large stacks"
1392,Emotion,AngerPoems098150WaysToOvercomeAngerPoembyGanChennai,"PHYSICAL RESOLVES FOR ANGER:
Close your eyes,  Focus on breath
Ask, Am I right? , Affirm, I will not shout
Speak in lighter voice (Most  Impossible)
Take a bath, Listen to favorite music
Go for a long Walk or a Careful Drive
Clasp palms firmly or
Fold hands across chest
Be Aware of hands
Look above your head
Awareness means Anger is done away
Walk Left and Right, Walk in circles
Look at the mirror, Focus on your eyes
Smile a Bit, Laugh a Bit, Scribble something
Say, 'You are Bloody Punk, If you get Anger'
Say, ' I am Godlike, I won't get Anger'
Place finger on Mush Area Horizontally or Vertically,
It puts physical barrier on Shouting
Meditate, Practice Yoga, Exercise
Drink Cold Water, Say 'Cool Down'
Say 'Om Shanthi' or Amen
MENTAL RESOLVES FOR ANGER:
Think Anger is Animalistic, Anger is Fire, Anger is Health Hazard
Anger is Anti-Relation, Anger is weakness, Think End Result of Anger
Be willing to overcome Anger, Resolve to end Anger
Think, Should the Pot (Relationship)            be Broken?
FEAR, WORRIES, FRUSTRATION – ROOT CAUSE OF ANGER:
Fear of Loss is Anger's root cause
Physical or Emotional it may be
Take Five Slow Deep Breaths
Pray - 'God give me strength, this moment
Be with me and Lead me through this crisis'
Some Worries put You In Deep Frustration, Anger
Have faith in God, Faith can move Anger, if not Mountains
Believe God Leads You, Have Faith, Everything happens for a Reason
Worrying a bit helps, Worrying a lot spoils
Anger means, No Inner calm, No inner Peace
Hate, Fear, Worries, Frustration, Anger are compatriots in Hell
Love, Courage, Calmness, Peace, Joy are compatriots in Heaven
Hate and Love Can't co-exist as Fire and Water can't
Believing is half done winning all battles
Say, I choose Love and Joy, I don't get Anger
ANGER IN FAMILY:
After Angry Tussle is over, Reconcile your partner or children
'I Love You So much, That's why I get Anger towards you'
You are so dear; Can I get Anger towards, Bill Gates?
Tell something and cajole knowingly it is nonsense,
Kiss, come to terms saying let's go Hotel, Pay few 100 Bucks
Introspection and Analysis  help come over Anger
Accept when you get Anger, say, I am sorry
When in Good Mood, Tell your partner,
If I get Anger, I will put 25 Sit-ups clutching my Ears
Do Perform Sit-ups at least in isolation, closed doors, Nothing to be Ashamed
ANGER FOR GOOD PURPOSE:
Anger is not bad if it serves purpose
Sometimes you may have to Act with Anger (Acting)
Towards Your Employees, Sub ordinates, Children
You should know you act with Anger
Purposeful Anger is Reasonably Correct
TAIL PIECE ON ANGER:
If nothing works, keep a Mouthful of Water.
Advise others not to get Anger, At least you will follow a Bit,
Master should be at least a good student.
Pat yourself (Really) , Whenever you overcome Anger
Scribble something like this, Put a little Tom-Tom in Poem Hunter
A Research like this will help at least Author, Even if not Poetic.

I am vulnerable,
true to flesh and bone,
I am human,
capable of making the light dissapear within my fingertips.
I love and hate,
as such reactions towards the darkness I look on knowing that I
just won't make it...
Cracked up smiles and blurry faces try to escape the side of your,
sweet prescence,
thinking that a girl so ignorant such as she could sustain her
anger much longer.
She must be human for she feels what she's been taught.
Self pity is what she wants,
so her selfishness she will get,
even if her veins burn with envy,
or tower over with regret.
You've tried so hard to stay so strong
but obviously not enough,
You know you can make it through to him
so act like you're tough.
These burned bridges are slowly finishing it's trail,
and silence will be joined at the end,
until then she'll stay a ruined creation of the world,
she'll live or make ammend."

and bursts throught fast.
The swelling breast
stretches the sinews

bringing into combat
all focuses of strength.
Restrained the sighing heart
descends the peak,
resting uneasily
and declaring weak.

1395,Emotion,HopePoemsHopePoembyEmilyJaneBrontë,"Hope was but a timid friend;
She sat without the grated den,
Watching how my fate would tend,
Even as selfish-hearted men.
She was cruel in her fear;
Through the bars, one dreary day,
I looked out to see her there,
And she turned her face away!
Like a false guard, false watch keeping,
Still, in strife, she whispered peace;
She would sing while I was weeping;
If I listened, she would cease.
False she was, and unrelenting;
When my last joys strewed the ground,
Even Sorrow saw, repenting,
Those sad relics scattered round;
Hope, whose whisper would have given
Balm to all my frenzied pain,
Stretched her wings, and soared to heaven,
Went, and ne'er returned again!"

And i hope
That my dreams are so clear
And when i wake up my eyes have no tears

Because I am hoping. Right?

How is it that hope can leave me
Trembling in the darkness?
How is it that something so “good”
Should leave me feeling helpless?
Dare I hope to hope?
What difference does it make?
Fate will be fate in the end,
It will either “make or break.”
Does Fate regard my hope?
Does She listen? Or care?
Am I shooting for a star that
Simply isn’t there?
I cannot know! Oh, God
Why must I struggle with
This doubt that pulls at me
Rends me, limb from limb?
What sort of hope leaves pain
Where it should instead leave joy?
Is this hope at all? Or perhaps
Some wicked demon’s ploy?
I cannot know! Dear heaven!
How can I even begin to dare
To hope for something – anything?
Is no assurance there?
No promise? No guarantee?
I cannot stand it! I cannot!
The doubt is a plague
In my every thought.

In a hope that leaves me dry
And lost? How can I dare
To hope in hope? How can I?"

And sent me from above
Wings such as clothe an angel's form,
The wings of joy and love.
With these to Pisgah's top I fly
And there delighted stand,
To view, beneath a shining sky,
The spacious promised land.
The Lord of all the vast domain
Has promised it to me,
The length and breadth of all the plain
As far as faith can see.
How glorious is my privilege!
To Thee for help I call;
I stand upon a mountain's edge,
O save me, lest I fall!
Though much exalted in the Lord,
My strength is not my own;
Then let me tremble at His word,
And none shall cast me down."

I know that the blessed,

As I write this poem,
only for you.
Something I thought,
I could never do.
I hope you accept this poem,

Times have seemed to change,
yet so many things remain the same.
There are so many things I have learned,
and so many pages that I have turned.
People are always changing,
trying to play the part.
Yet the only movement I felt,
is the one inside my heart.
The Gods have shined down on me,
to give me the courage to write to thee.
Yes or no, right or wrong,
my faith in us, will be forever strong.
Although my will was not enough,
to share my feelings before you left.
I respect our friendship the way it exists,
I can't help wondering if more could exist.
I think of the good times that we shared,
I never knew the burdens you bared.
I really wish I knew your pain,
I'd have done anything to take it all away.
There were so many things I wanted to say;
but here I am writing so far away.
Thousands of miles and an ocean away,
my feelings for you will always remain.
I haven't much to give,
only one life to live.
So little money and so few possessions,
a simple man with no obsessions.
For my hope carries me on,
and my faith makes me strong.
My heart and soul and love for you,
these are what I offer you.
With a soul,
as stong as you;
when I sleep,
I dream of you.
My faith and thoughts of happiness,
you're my sanity in this world of madness.
You remain in my thoughts everyday,
and I hope we will meet another day."
1401,Emotion,HopePoemsAPastoralBalladIiHopePoembyWilliamShenstone,"My banks they are furnish'd with bees,
Whose murmur invites one to sleep;
My grottos are shaded with trees,
And my hills are white-over with sheep.
I seldom have met with a loss,
Such health do my fountains bestow;
My fountains all border'd with moss,
Where the hare-bells and violets grow.
Not a pine in my grove is there seen,
But with tendrils of woodbine is bound:
Not a beech's more beautiful green,
But a sweet-briar entwines it around.
Not my fields, in the prime of the year,
More charms than my cattle unfold;
Not a brook that is limpid and clear,
But it glitters with fishes of gold.
One would think she might like to retire
To the bow'r I have labour'd to rear;
Not a shrub that I heard her admire,
But I hasted and planted it there.
O how sudden the jessamine strove
With the lilac to render it gay!
Already it calls for my love,
To prune the wild branches away.
From the plains, from the woodlands and groves,
What strains of wild melody flow!
How the nightingales warble their loves
From thickets of roses that blow!
And when her bright form shall appear,
Each bird shall harmoniously join
In a concert so soft and so clear,
As -- she may not be fond to resign.
I have found out a gift for my fair;
I have found where the wood-pigeons breed:
But let me that plunder forbear,
She will say 'twas a barbarous deed.
For he ne'er could be true, she aver'd,
Who could rob a poor bird of its young:
And I lov'd her the more, when I heard
Such tenderness fall from her tongue.
I have heard her with sweetness unfold
How that pity was due to -- a dove:
That it ever attended the bold;
And she call'd it the sister of love.
But her words such a pleasure convey,
So much I her accents adore,
Let her speak, and whatever she say,
Methinks I should love her the more.
Can a bosom so gentle remain
Unmov'd, when her Corydon sighs!
Will a nymph that is fond of the plain,
These plains and this valley despise?
Dear regions of silence and shade!
Soft scenes of contentment and ease!
Where I could have pleasingly stray'd,
If aught, in her absence, could please.
But where does my Phyllida stray?
And where are her grots and her bow'rs?
Are the groves and the valleys as gay,
And the shepherds as gentle as ours?
The groves may perhaps be as fair,
And the face of the valleys as fine;
The swains may in manners compare,
But their love is not equal to mine."

O'er the real dead, in dull earth laid asleep—

That passed and left me in the sun's bright rays.
Now though you go on smiling in the sun
Our love is slain, and love and you were one.
You are the first, you I have known so long,
Whose death was deadly, a tremendous wrong.
Therefore I seek the faith that sets it right
Amid the lilies and the candle-light.
I think on Heaven, for in that air so dear
We two may meet, confused and parted here.
Ah, when man's dearest dies,'tis then he goes
To that old balm that heals the centuries' woes.

One little star benignant peep,
To light along their trackless path
The wanderers of the stormy deep.
And thus, oh Hope! thy lovely form
In sorrow's gloomy night shall be
The sun that looks through cloud and storm
Upon a dark and moonless sea.
When heaven is all serene and fair,
Full many a brighter gem we meet;
'Tis when the tempest hovers there,
Thy beam is most divinely sweet.
The rainbow, when the sun declines,
Like faithless friend will disappear;
Thy light, dear star! more brightly shines
When all is wail and weeping here.
And though Aurora's stealing beam
May wake a morning of delight,
'Tis only thy consoling beam
Will smile amid affliction's night."
1412,Emotion,HopePoemsHopePoembyJayPNarain,"What is hope, ask a bee in cold winter days,
she hangs around the pruned rose bushes,
with the hope that someday the spring will come,
and the flowers will bloom again in the garden.
What is hope, ask the blue bird pair in early spring,
they work diligently to bring every twig and grass,
to build their nest in the corner nook of my house,
I see the hope in the eyes of this lovely pair,
They are dreaming of a happy home for their family.
What is hope,  ask a lonesome soul,
When the uncertainties linger around in mind,
hope is the only refuge to calm our fears,
When the loneliness sends one in depression,
the hope of a companionship overshadows the despair.
What is hope, ask a human being,
our life is a sand castle of hope on a sandy beach,
with the lingering fear of drowning in occasional high tide,
our destiny, our future, and our own survival,
hangs around the magical hope, the hope that is the eternal inspiration."
1413,Emotion,HopePoemsEnjoyHopePoembySandraOsborne,"So many
Different dreary  worlds,
That it’s hard to make a choice,
Hard to choose at all,
Hard to have to.
Ahh, that’s it isn’t it? Choice.
The great commanding curse
Of freedom.  It’s very source.
No Freedom without it,
Only a painful apathy,
With no worry, and no hope.
For hope is always tight with worry,
Hope and dread, did I make the right choice?
Did I choose wrongly? The stress, anxiety
Over the future, over it’s hope.
Yet, and still, there are no wrong choices,
Just fleeting, frozen moments.
Forever, and without changes,
With no way to make them.
So don’t worry,
Just choose and go, follow
Freedom’s path to the next choice,
And don’t worry,
Enjoy the hope."
1414,Emotion,HopePoemsSonnetXxvFalseHopeProlongsPoembySamuelDaniel,"False hope prolongs my ever certain grief,
Trait'rous to me and faithful to my love;
A thousand times it promis'd me relief,
Yet never any true effect I prove.
Oft when I find in her no truth at all,
I banish her and blame her treachery;
Yet soon again I must her back recall,
As one that dies without her company.
Thus often as I chase my hope from me,
Straight way she hastes her unto Delia's eyes;
Fed with some pleasing look there shall she be,
And so sent back, and thus my fortune lies.
Looks feed my Hope, Hope fosters me in vain;
Hopes are unsure, when certain is my pain."
1415,Emotion,HopePoemsWhenThereIsNoHopeAndNothingToHopeForPoembyShalomFreedman,"WHEN THERE IS NO HOPE AND NOTHING TO HOPE FOR
When there is no hope and nothing to hope for
When no specific path presents itself
When there seems no way out
When one has already tried so much
And not succeeded
When one is older and weaker
And knows one cannot be as good
As one once was
When that too was not good enough
When the only way open
Seems a natural going down
When there is no hope and nothing to hope for
And when one begins to think of ‘miracles'
In a way one has never done before
When there seems no way out
And nothing to hope for
And one in desperation tries to think and think
Look and find
A new way
That will succeed at last
And nothing appears and nothing comes
When there is no hope and nothing to hope for
And Desperation deepens
And one cannot find the way out."

These mortal bones against my body set,
For all the puny fever and frail sweat
Of human love,—renounce for these, I say,
The Singing Mountain's memory, and betray
The silent lyre that hangs upon me yet?
Ah, but indeed, some day shall you awake,
Rather, from dreams of me, that at your side
So many nights, a lover and a bride,
But stern in my soul's chastity, have lain,
To walk the world forever for my sake,
And in each chamber find me gone again!"

It is conceived in the mind
Believed to be blind
Hope is a quest to be free
An open door or key

A belief in something strong
In things unseen or unheard
Hope sounds absurd
But we can live on hope and dreams
On schemes built on itself
Hope and dreams are our wealth!"

1420,Emotion,HopePoemsHopeOrHopeAgainstHopePoembyKumarmaniMahakul,"Hope is an expectation or
Desire for certain event,
It relates to persons, things
Or to circumstances it is inherent.
Not only men but also animal
And birds, reptiles have hope,
All live on hope or hope against hope
Hopeless persons have no scope.
Men live in hope and
In hope they dream,
To dream many lovely things
Is too dream of a team.
Hope is the reason of attachment
And it is the art,
It is too reason of detachment
And it is the heart.
Maximum people hope to get
Perishable things they want,
But these are such things
Those bring men daunt.
Hope to lead valuable life
And value in life is the best,
We must hope peace and bless of God
There actually are the zests."
1421,Emotion,HopePoemsFloweryFieldsOfLoveAndHopePoembyUriahHamilton,"I’ve seen dark eyes
Of imminent oblivion,
I’ve felt the warm breath
Of the hounds of death
Breathing against my neck.
And it has been
A long season of recriminations
Since the days of youth
When a woman’s face
Shone like the sun.
But conflagrations of desire
No longer take me higher,
They just incinerate
My ardent dreams,
Strangle me in ropes
Of despondency.
My wounded mind
Hallucinates possibilities,
Then slides into
A darkening drift
Of pessimism,
An avalanche of fear.
All thoughts explode,
Fulminations of failure,
Tirades of defeat,
A heartbreaking wail
For a life incomplete.
In desperate times,
I know I need
A near-death experience
To receive an epiphany,
A glimpse into eternity.
If there are
Flowery fields
Of love and hope,
I need to find
Those precious blooms
Before I close my eyes
To a final sunset."
1422,Emotion,HopePoemsHopeDiethHopeLivethPoembyWilliamMorris,"Strong are thine arms, O love, & strong
Thine heart to live, and love, and long;
But thou art wed to grief and wrong:
Live, then, and long, though hope be dead!
Live on, & labour thro’ the years!
Make pictures through the mist of tears,
Of unforgotten happy fears,
That crossed the time ere hope was dead.
Draw near the place where once we stood
Amid delight’s swift-rushing flood,
And we and all the world seemed good
Nor needed hope now cold and dead.
Dream in the dawn I come to thee
Weeping for things that may not be!
Dream that thou layest lips on me!
Wake, wake to clasp hope’s body dead!
Count o’er and o’er, and one by one
The minutes of the happy sun
That while agone on kissed lips shone,
Count on, rest not, for hope is dead.
Weep, though no hair’s breadth thou shalt move
The living Earth, the heaven above
By all the bitterness of love!
Weep and cease not, now hope is dead!
Sighs rest thee not, tears bring no ease,
Life hath no joy, and Death no peace:
The years change not, though they decrease,
For hope is dead, for hope is dead.
Speak, love, I listen: far away
I bless the tremulous lips, that say,
“Mock not the afternoon of day,
Mock not the tide when hope is dead!”
I bless thee, O my love, who say’st:
“Mock not the thistle-cumbered waste;
I hold Love’s hand, and make no haste
Down the long way, now hope is dead.
With other names do we name pain,
The long years wear our hearts in vain.
Mock not our loss grown into gain,
Mock not our lost hope lying dead.
Our eyes gaze for no morning-star,
No glimmer of the dawn afar;
Full silent wayfarers we are
Since ere the noon-tide hope lay dead.
Behold with lack of happiness
The master, Love, our hearts did bless
Lest we should think of him the less:
Love dieth not, though hope is dead!”"
1423,Emotion,HopePoemsToHopePoembyJohnKeats,"WHEN by my solitary hearth I sit,
And hateful thoughts enwrap my soul in gloom;
When no fair dreams before my ""mind's eye"" flit,
And the bare heath of life presents no bloom;
Sweet Hope, ethereal balm upon me shed,
And wave thy silver pinions o'er my head!
Whene'er I wander, at the fall of night,
Where woven boughs shut out the moon's bright ray,
Should sad Despondency my musings fright,
And frown, to drive fair Cheerfulness away,
Peep with the moonbeams through the leafy roof,
And keep that fiend Despondence far aloof!
Should Disappointment, parent of Despair,
Strive for her son to seize my careless heart;
When, like a cloud, he sits upon the air,
Preparing on his spell-bound prey to dart:
Chase him away, sweet Hope, with visage bright,
And fright him as the morning frightens night!
Whene'er the fate of those I hold most dear
Tells to my fearful breast a tale of sorrow,
O bright-eyed Hope, my morbidfancy cheer;
Let me awhile thy sweetest comforts borrow:
Thy heaven-born radiance around me shed,
And wave thy silver pinions o'er my head!
Should e'er unhappy love my bosom pain,
From cruel parents, or relentless fair;
O let me think it is not quite in vain
To sigh out sonnets to the midnight air!
Sweet Hope, ethereal balm upon me shed,
And wave thy silver pinions o'er my head!
In the long vista of the years to roll,
Let me not see our country's honour fade:
O let me see our land retain her soul,
Her pride, her freedom; and not freedom's shade.
From thy bright eyes unusual brightness shed---
Beneath thy pinions canopy my head!
Let me not see the patriot's high bequest,
Great Liberty! how great in plain attire!
With the base purple of a court oppress'd,
Bowing her head, and ready to expire:
But let me see thee stoop from heaven on wings
That fill the skies with silver glitterings!
And as, in sparkling majesty, a star
Gilds the bright summit of some gloomy cloud;
Brightening the half veil'd face of heaven afar:
So, when dark thoughts my boding spirit shroud,
Sweet Hope, celestial influence round me shed,
Waving thy silver pinions o'er my head!"
1424,Emotion,HopePoemsEvelynHopePoembyRobertBrowning,"I.
Beautiful Evelyn Hope is dead!
Sit and watch by her side an hour.
That is her book-shelf, this her bed;
She plucked that piece of geranium-flower,
Beginning to die too, in the glass;
Little has yet been changed, I think:
The shutters are shut, no light may pass
Save two long rays thro' the hinge's chink.
II.
Sixteen years old, when she died!
Perhaps she had scarcely heard my name;
It was not her time to love; beside,
Her life had many a hope and aim,
Duties enough and little cares,
And now was quiet, now astir,
Till God's hand beckoned unawares,---
And the sweet white brow is all of her.
III.
Is it too late then, Evelyn Hope?
What, your soul was pure and true,
The good stars met in your horoscope,
Made you of spirit, fire and dew---
And, just because I was thrice as old
And our paths in the world diverged so wide,
Each was nought to each, must I be told?
We were fellow mortals, nought beside?
IV.
No, indeed! for God above
Is great to grant, as mighty to make,
And creates the love to reward the love:
I claim you still, for my own love's sake!
Delayed it may be for more lives yet,
Through worlds I shall traverse, not a few:
Much is to learn, much to forget
Ere the time be come for taking you.
V.
But the time will come,---at last it will,
When, Evelyn Hope, what meant (I shall say)
In the lower earth, in  the  years  long  still,
That body and soul so pure and gay?
Why your hair was amber, I shall divine,
And your mouth of your own geranium's red---
And  what  you  would  do  with  me,  in   fine,
In the new life come in the old one's stead.
VI.
I have lived (I shall say) so much since then,
Given up myself so many times,
Gained me the gains of various men,
Ransacked the ages, spoiled the climes;
Yet one thing, one, in my soul's full scope,
Either I missed or itself missed me:
And I want and find you, Evelyn Hope!
What is the issue? let us see!
VII.
I loved you, Evelyn, all the while.
My heart seemed full as it could hold?
There was place and to spare for the frank young smile,
And the red young mouth, and the hair's young gold.
So, hush,---I will give you this leaf to keep:
See, I shut it inside the sweet cold hand!
There, that is our secret: go to sleep!
You will wake, and remember, and understand."
1425,Emotion,HopePoemsHopePoembyFriedrichSchiller,"We speak with the lip, and we dream in the soul,
Of some better and fairer day;
And our days, the meanwhile, to that golden goal
Are gliding and sliding away.
Now the world becomes old, now again it is young,
But ""The better"" 's forever the word on the tongue.
At the threshold of life hope leads us in--
Hope plays round the mirthful boy;
Though the best of its charms may with youth begin,
Yet for age it reserves its toy."

The scorching-Summer has not had mid-show'rs;
The air is hot and sultry, very dry;
The trees have scarcely any leaves or flow'rs.
In Life, things turn unbearable, so oft;
Our patience gets outlasted to its brink;
Who will say words that soothen every heart?
Our sinful souls thirst for a graceful drink.
Yet, miracles will happen although late;
The God of Love and kindness watches us;
There is nothing called destiny or fate;
God gives the tolerance for every stress.
So, wait with patience for times better , Man;
For things happen according to God's plan."
1427,Emotion,HopePoemsTheLightOfHopePoembyRachelSlimm,"Endless dark - or so it seems,
life is shattered, with all our dreams
of joy and hope, the fading light,
and darkness, darkness for all in sight.
No words can speak of pain that's borne,
or fears unfounded, the sharpest thorn,
deserted mind, with heart and soul,
the wish of death, the bell will toll.
A mind of riddles, flesh we scorn,
and hope for day, the light of dawn.
The night is long, the darkness set,
the hope of morn, existing yet?
But morn will be, and dark will fade,
the light of hope, the desert shade,
the winter's comfort, summer's breeze,
as blooms of spring, the sun appears,
a welcome friend, the silence broke,
my soul returns, my demons choke,
faith and hope I once more find,
in shadows of my heart and mind.
Reason warped by darkness' might,
arights in friendship's glorious light,
survival comes from God's own power,
endurance through my darkest hour.

1432,Emotion,HopePoemsThePleasuresOfHopeExcerptPoembyThomasCampbell,"PART I (excerpt)
...
Where barbarous hordes on Scythian mountains roam,
Truth, Mercy, Freedom, yet shall find a home;
Where'er degraded Nature bleeds and pines,
From Guinea's coast to Sibir's dreary mines,
Truth shall pervade the unfathomed darkness there,
And light the dreadful features of despair.
Hark! the stern captive spurns his heavy load,
And asks the image back that Heaven bestowed.
Fierce in his eye the fire of valour burns,
And, as the slave departs, the man returns.
Oh! sacred Truth! thy triumph ceased awhile,
And Hope, thy sister, ceased with thee to smile,
When leagued Oppression poured to Northern wars
Her whiskered pandoors and her fierce hussars,
Waved her dread standard to the breeze of morn,
Pealed her loud drum, and twanged her trumpet horn;
Tumultuous horror brooded o'er her van,
Presaging wrath to Poland--and to man!
Warsaw's last champion from her height surveyed
Wide o'er the fields, a waste of ruin laid;
""Oh! Heaven!"" he cried, ""my bleeding country save!
Is there no hand on high to shield the brave?
Yet, though destruction sweep these lovely plains,
Rise, fellow men! our country yet remains!
By that dread name we wave the sword on high,
And swear for her to live!--with her to die!""
He said, and on the rampart-heights arrayed
His trusty warriors, few but undismayed;
Firm-paced and slow, a horrid front they form,
Still as the breeze, but dreadful as the storm;
Low murmuring sounds along their banners fly,
Revenge, or death,--the watch-word and reply;
Then pealed the notes, omnipotent to charm,
And the loud tocsin tolled their last alarm!
In vain, alas! in vain, ye gallant few!
From rank to rank your volleyed thunder flew;
Oh, bloodiest picture in the book of Time,
Sarmatia fell, unwept, without a crime;
Found not a generous friend, a pitying foe,
Strength in her arms, nor mercy in her woe!
Dropped from her nerveless grasp the shattered spear,
Closed her bright eye, and curbed her high career,--
Hope, for a season, bade the world farewell,
And Freedom shrieked--as Kosciusko fell!
The sun went down, nor ceased the carnage there.
Tumultuous murder shook the midnight air;
On Prague's proud arch the fires of ruin glow,
His blood-dyed waters murmuring far below;
The storm prevails, the rampart yields a way;
Bursts the wide cry of horror and dismay!
Hark! as the smouldering piles with thunder fall,
A thousand shrieks for hopeless mercy call!
Earth shook; red meteors flashed along the sky,
And conscious Nature shuddered at the cry!
Oh! righteous Heaven! ere Freedom found a grave,
Why slept the sword omnipotent to save?
Where was thine arm, O Vengeance! where thy rod,
That smote the foes of Zion and of God,
That crushed proud Ammon, when his iron car
Was yoked in wrath, and thundered from afar?
Where was the storm that slumbered till the host
Of blood-stained Pharaoh left their trembling coast,
Then bade the deep in wild commotion flow,
And heaved an ocean on their march below?

To warm with life and be itself again?
Something about me daily speaks there must,
And why should instinct nourish hopes in vain?

And everything seems struggling to explain
The close sealed volume of its mystery.
Time wandering onward keeps its usual pace
As seeming anxious of eternity,

To die unworthy of a second spring?"

Emptiness is nothing

You call me an escapist,

Cups of poison steeped in shame.

Even ghosts fear to enter.

Thy airy dreams on peaceful pillows shed,
And weave for thoughtless brows, a garland gay.
Farewell low vallies; dizzy cliffs, farewell!

To hide, where meditation loves to dwell,

As we live our lives in every which way
We must keep our heads up
And accentuate the positive
That is the attitude that we must have
Because we all have one life to live"
1440,Emotion,HopePoemsLoveFaithAndHopePoembyBobGotti,"Love is one identifying mark that sets Believers and others apart.
Men will know us from others when we have love one for another.
Love covers a multitude of sin, when you have Christ’s love within.
It was Christ’s love on the cross that covered the sins of the lost.
No greater love to comprehend than giving one’s life for a friend.
In His love, God did condescend, saving sinners like us, my friend.
We display the love of Christ, when we become a living sacrifice.
It’s a reasonable service to Him; As His Love washed away our sin.
If in your life you give God His place, He will then fill you with faith.
This Faith centers upon Him; as Christ turns you from a life of sin.
Faith becomes your foundation, the moment you receive Salvation.
Friend in your newly found Faith, you will be led by God’s Grace.
And friend your Faith is assured, as you put your Hope in The Lord,
Not in your life or other men but Hope in the One who God did send.
For Christ is The Hope of all men, He is The Beginning and The End,
As Christ is The Hope of certainty, that goes on well into Eternity.
My friend, Faith, Hope and Love, they are all gifts from God up above,
And if you glean from up above, you will see that the greatest is Love.
God’s Love produces in us a Faith that helps us point to God’s Grace.
Grace appeared to all then, and Christ remains The Hope of all men.

1441,Emotion,HopePoemsWorkWithoutHopePoembySamuelTaylorColeridge,"All Nature seems at work. Slugs leave their lair--
The bees are stirring--birds are on the wing--
And WINTER slumbering in the open air,
Wears on his smiling face a dream of Spring !
And I, the while, the sole unbusy thing,
Nor honey make, nor pair, nor build, nor sing.
Yet well I ken the banks where Amaranths blow,
Have traced the fount whence streams of nectar flow.
Bloom, O ye Amaranths ! bloom for whom ye may,
For me ye bloom not ! Glide, rich streams, away !
With lips unbrightened, wreathless brow, I stroll :
And would you learn the spells that drowse my soul ?
WORK WITHOUT HOPE draws nectar in a sieve,
And HOPE without an object cannot live."
1442,Emotion,HopePoemsLamentationsOfJeremiahIiiHopeOfReliefThroughGodsMercyPoembyProphetJeremiah,"1 I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.
2 He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light.
3 Surely against me is he turned;
he turneth his hand against me all the day.
4 My flesh and my skin hath he made old;
he hath broken my bones.
5 He hath builded against me,
and compassed me with gall and travail.
6 He hath set me in dark places,
as they that be dead of old.
7 He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out:
he hath made my chain heavy.
8 Also when I cry and shout,
he shutteth out my prayer.
9 He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone;
he hath made my paths crooked.
10 He was unto me as a bear lying in wait,
and as a lion in secret places.
11 He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces:
he hath made me desolate.
12 He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.
13 He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.
14 I was a derision to all my people;
and their song all the day.
15 He hath filled me with bitterness,
he hath made me drunken with wormwood.
16 He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones,
he hath covered me with ashes.
17 And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace:
I forgat prosperity.
18 And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:
19 remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.
20 My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.
21 This I recall to my mind,
therefore have I hope.
22 It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not consumed,
because his compassions fail not.
23 They are new every morning:
great is thy faithfulness.
24 The LORD is my portion, saith my soul;
therefore will I hope in him.
25 The LORD is good unto them that wait for him,
to the soul that seeketh him.
26 It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.
27 It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.
28 He sitteth alone and keepeth silence,
because he hath borne it upon him.
29 He putteth his mouth in the dust;
if so be there may be hope.
30 He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him:
he is filled full with reproach.
31 For the Lord will not cast off for ever:
32 but though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion
according to the multitude of his mercies.
33 For he doth not afflict willingly,
nor grieve the children of men.
34 To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,
35 to turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High,
36 to subvert a man in his cause,
the Lord approveth not.
37 Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass,
when the Lord commandeth it not?
38 Out of the mouth of the Most High proceedeth not evil and good?
39 Wherefore doth a living man complain,
a man for the punishment of his sins?
40 Let us search and try our ways,
and turn again to the LORD.
41 Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.
42 We have transgressed and have rebelled:
thou hast not pardoned.
43 Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us:
thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.
44 Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud,
that our prayer should not pass through.
45 Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.
46 All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.
47 Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.
48 Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water
for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
49 Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,
50 till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.
51 Mine eye affecteth mine heart,
because of all the daughters of my city.
52 Mine enemies chased me sore,
like a bird, without cause.
53 They have cut off my life in the dungeon,
and cast a stone upon me.
54 Waters flowed over mine head;
then I said, I am cut off.
55 I called upon thy name, O LORD,
out of the low dungeon.
56 Thou hast heard my voice:
hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.
57 Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee:
thou saidst, Fear not.
58 O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul;
thou hast redeemed my life.
59 O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong:
judge thou my cause.
60 Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me.
61 Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD,
and all their imaginations against me;
62 the lips of those that rose up against me,
and their device against me all the day.
63 Behold their sitting down, and their rising up;
I am their music.
64 Render unto them a recompense, O LORD,
according to the work of their hands.
65 Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.
66 Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD."

1444,Emotion,HopePoemsHopeForTheFuturePoembyJosephTRenaldi,"Today we face the trying times
Of heartache and pain.
Many hopes and dreams are shattered,
And prayers seem to be in vain.
With the hope of peace diminishing,
The heart has no definitive song.
We've waited for an end to hostilities,
But the struggle seems so long.
Yet - there is hope for the future,
Liberty and freedom are still in command,
But God will make the ultimate decisions.
He will evaluate our worldly demands,
And he holds the future in his grasp.
Why should we despair?
He mourns and counts every tear,
And he hears and reviews every prayer."
1445,Emotion,HopePoemsSonnetWhisperingHopePoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"A girl of beauty, shy and innocent!
She liked to stay aloof in her own world;
She read a lot of books while in convent:
Stood first in school in every exam held!
She had few friends and stayed away from boys!
Her dress was neat although simple and cheap!
She sang some songs alone in high-pitched voice;
She prayed a lot and in her heart did weep?
My elder sister, lovely, sweet and nice,
She joined Health Service as a Government Doc;
'One blunder in her life proved her unwise! '
She serves the sick and poor by hearty talk!
Did God ignore her desires in life?
Lord, save her soul and keep her safe ’midst strife!

Metals and odorous woods and cunning gold,
Fowls of the air and furry beasts untold,
Vineyards and harvest fields and fruitful trees

Vouched passage to her secret ways of old
Whence knowledge should be wrung, nay power to mould
Out of the rough, his occult destinies.
But tired of these he craved a wider scope:
Then fair as Pallas from the brain of Jove
From his deep wish there sprang, full-armed, to cope
With all life's ills, even very death in love,
The only thing man never wearies of--
His own creation--visionary Hope."

One day all will have freedom
All will live in peace

Holding on to our hope
Noticing all the beauty
Feeling all the freedom
When we walk in love

If we trade darkness for sunshine
Trade hate for love
Trade defeatism for hope
Trade bondage for freedom
To enjoy a world full of beauty.

If we look we will find the peace
If we look we will find the freedom
If we look we will find the sunshine
If we look we will find the hope
If we look we will find the love.

Share the beauty
Share the hope
For this world to be full of peace
By us all living in the sunshine
For a new world full of freedom.
Let us all feel the freedom
By learning to love
Each other like we love sunshine
And seeing each others beauty
Together we will have peace
If we hold onto hope.

To treasure our beauty and sunshine

Dimmed by no gray -
No gray!
While the winds wing us
Sighs from The Gone,
Nearer to dawn
Minute-beats bring us;
When there will sing us
Larks of a glory
Waiting our story
Further anon -
Anon!
Doff the black token,
Don the red shoon,
Right and retune
Viol-strings broken;
Null the words spoken
In speeches of rueing,
The night cloud is hueing,
To-morrow shines soon -
Shines soon!"

With locks of gold, and eyes that shamed the light;
I prayed that God might have her in His care

(Sweet mother-earth was but a lying name)
The path she showed was but the path of wrong
And shame.

1458,Emotion,HopePoemsWhatIsHopeHopeIsLikePoembyAmbrosiaAmbrosia,"Hope, a magical word of four letters
Although everyone struggle to hold fast, scared of loosing it,
Never vanishes from anyone’s life, well what is hope?
Hope is like morning sun
Although an hour late or early,
Never forgets to rise, to start lively life
Hope is like twinkling stars
Although for a while hide behind dark clouds,
Never stop emitting starlight, even in the darkest night
Hope is like enchanting moon
Although disappears for a fortnight,
Never fails to sooth us wherever, however, whatever we are
Hope is like tender grass root
Although gets crushed for few days
Never give up, peeps out beside the hardest rocks and tiles
Hope is like nature
Although attacked by miscreants, calamities
Never allow anyone to perish its infinite flora and fauna
Hope is like newborn baby
Although cry a bit after birth to proclaim its entry
Never get in the way of putting smile on anyone’s face
Hope is like tomorrow
Although comes with mixed bag of joy and sorrow
Never ignores anyone, its there for everyone
Hope is like faith in GOD
Although faints occasionally in difficult times
Never disappoints anyone in the end
RAY OF HOPE SHOULD NEVER GO OUT OF ANYBODY’S LIFE"
1459,Emotion,HopePoemsASongOfHopePoembyDavidSmithWhite,"I refuse to be depressed,
'cause I'm totally obsessed,
with the feeling that I'm really lying.
It's an idea that I detest,
but once gotten off my chest,
I know I'll feel less and less like crying.
I won't yield to grim despair;
I must just grin and bear,
'cause I've other irons in the fire, frying.
If I'm burnt out or I scar,
when my words have turned to char,
it's not because this Smithy's stopped trying.
So life goes on and on,
and I know I'll carry on,
with the hope of a song in my heart.
I know I must be strong,
lest my quest to belong,
is diverted or goes wrong from the start.
By now I think you've guessed,
that life is no idle jest;
what scares us most is not just the fear of dying.
It is the panic and the stress,
of emotions long suppressed;
the narcotic of self-love and self-denying.
With the passing of the days,
I know I'll find a way,
to keep that song singing in my soul.
If my life begins to fray,
at ambition's sad dismay,
there is resource in disarray controlled.
So if you find you're not impressed,
by the things that I express,
and the knot of love between us is untying;
will you not think me a pest,
if I honestly confess,
that my life with you was truly satisfying.
Though there's no objective test,
we must know that we're possessed,
of a love that's true and real and gratifying.
And if we live our lives with zest,
and keep striving for the best,
we cannot lose unless no one is buying.
So as time begins to fade,
I'll keep the promises I made,
to press that song forever to my breast.
And as the closing act is played,
when the bill of death is paid,
my final breath will sing me to my rest."

To bid the shapes of fear and grief depart;
Come, gentle Hope! with one gay smile remove
The lasting sadness of an aching heart.
Thy voice, benign Enchantress! let me hear;
Say that for me some pleasures yet shall bloom,--
That Fancy's radiance, Friendship's precious tear,
Shall soften, or shall chase, misfortune's gloom.
But come not glowing in the dazzling ray,
Which once with dear illusions charm'd my eye,--
O! strew no more, sweet flatterer! on my way
The flowers I fondly thought too bright to die;
Visions less fair will soothe my pensive breast,
That asks not happiness, but longs for rest!"

Confusion mounting screams of dismay

free from feelings of where and when
The calm of his face in darkness shown
with a majestic grandeur; he left his throne
Thus he spoke to the people aloud

Through the crevice comes a ray of light

For yonder look the land’s in sight'

Because the skies are fair;
The tempest may come on apace
And overcome thee there.
When far above the mountain tops
Thou soarest, over all –
If, then, the storm should press thee back,
How great would be thy fall!
And thou wouldst lie here at my feet,
A poor and lifeless thing, -
A torn and bleeding birdling,
With limp and broken wing.
Sing not too loud, O bird of Hope!
Because the day is bright;
The sunshine cannot always last –
The morn precedes the night.
And if thy song is of the day,
Then when the day grows dim,
Forlorn and voiceless thou wouldst sit
Among the shadows grim.
Oh! I would have thee soar and sing,
But not too high, or loud,
Remembering that day meets night –
The brilliant sun the cloud."

An ever brighter burnish than before
And turns to wash it from her welling eyes
And breathes the blots off all with sighs on sighs.
Her glass is blest but she as good as blind
Holds till hand aches and wonders what is there;
Her glass drinks light, she darkles down behind,
All of her glorious gainings unaware.

The wrong side of spilt milk
All hope lies in tomorrow
Forgetting yesterday
All hope is stored in thoughts
Arranged to form a play
There’s laughter and there’s intrigue
There’s sadness and there’s pain
Yet by the final act
Laughter rules again
All hope lies in tomorrow
Aphrodite by my side
To walk a brave new world
Athena as my guide
All hope lies in tomorrow
Under Helios’s light
To trust tomorrow to Themis
Her justice and her right"
1477,Emotion,HopePoemsHopePoembyHollyHeron,"I've heard hopes enough,
Enough to keep you alive,
They say that hopes a joyous feeling,
Hope that they''ll come back,
Hope they'll see their mistake,
But hope hurts more than the the deepest betrayal,
It keeps you awake at night,
With dreams that tomorow,
Well, that tomorrow everything will go back,
Back to how it was,
Back to love and happiness,
And then in the morning when nothings changed,
When your all alone,
Wondering why,
Then you know the truth of hope,
That hope gives you sleepless nights,
The pain thats throbbing in your chest,
The knowledge that for all your want,
It will never be the same,
And that hope is the biggest betrayal."
1478,Emotion,HopePoemsHopePoembyFloraAParham,"AS I LOOK INTO THE FUTURE,
I HOPE FOR PEACE.

FOR IN THIS LIES THE HOPE OF MANKIND.
GOD IS LOVE

LIFE IS GOD'S GIFT TO MAN.
HOPE IS THE WANTING OF A BETTER FUTURE
OF A RICHER MEANING OF WHAT LOVE IS ALL

And life becomes hell
Hope floats
Even as the world deserts you
And friends are few
Hope floats
Even as the only thing you have
Is a loneliness that is scary
Hope floats
Even as all seems lost and
Time remains a few grains of sand
Hope floats
Even as life seems beyond complaint
And strains of joy become faint
Hope floats
There may be nothing else to do
Than survive
And yet…as the self becomes distant
From the soul
There's a voice that says
Hope floats..."
1480,Emotion,HopePoemsHopePoembyRandallJarrell,"The spirit killeth, but the letter giveth life.
The week is dealt out like a hand
That children pick up card by card.
One keeps getting the same hand.
One keeps getting the same card.
But twice a day -- except on Saturday --
The wheel stops, there is a crack in Time:
With a hiss of soles, a rattle of tin,
My own gray Daemon pauses on the stair,
My own bald Fortune lifts me by the hair.
Woe's me! woe's me! In Folly's mailbox
Still laughs the postcard, Hope:
Your uncle in Australia
Has died and you are Pope,
For many a soul has entertained
A Mailman unawares --
And as you cry, Impossible,
A step is on the stairs.
One keeps getting the same dream
Delayed, marked ""Payment Due,""
The bill that one has paid
Delayed, marked ""Payment Due"" --
Twice a day, in rotting mailbox,
The white grubs are new:
And Faith, once more, is mine
Faithfully, but Charity
Writes hopefully about a new
Asylum -- but Hope is as good as new.
Woe's me! woe's me! In Folly's mailbox
Still laughs the postcard, Hope:
Your uncle in Australia
Has died and you are Pope,
For many a soul has entertained
A mailman unawares --
And as you cry, Impossible,
A step is on the stairs."

Mend my heart with golden thread
Weave your healing all around
In and out through my soul
Patches of love to cover the void
Made from the finest in the land
Tenderly spin me a new dream
One of love and hope in between
Cradle my heart
In finest silk
Softly and sensual to the touch
But strong for many years of wear
Show me with pride
Give me to one who will cherish
A slightly used but still useful heart
One that will keep them warm with love forever more"
1482,Emotion,HopePoemsHopeIsLifePoembyGSivaShankar,"Once in your lifetime,
You would have thought that
What am I doing with my life?
You might think that your future is blank.
You may think your career is in a crossroads.
You may think that you have made bad choices.
You may even think that life is full of shit.
But know this,
Whatever happens, happens for a reason.
You are here for a reason.
There is a purpose for your existence.
Think of this whenever you feel down, whenever you feel that that life sucks.
Everything happens for the Greater good,
Always think of this after every failure.
“HOPE IS LIFE.”"
1483,Emotion,HopePoemsDonTGiveUpHopePoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"Don't give up hope
Don't give up hope
There is still a whole slew of scope in hope
I know how you feel
Your predicament is unpleasant and real
Before you crumble and stumble
Like a lone wolf in your solitary struggles
I hear the sadness in your tongue
Realize that your suffering will pass
Its duration may be long
Hang in there, be strong
I know the words to your plightful song
You are not where you wish to belong
But giving up hope is forever wrong
A flower never fumbles and gives up hope
While waiting for its daily water
Hope is all to it that matters
Don't give up hope
Don't give up hope
Clutch on tight to all ropes
There is still a whole slew of scope in hope

Jumping on the bed Christmas morning
Giddy and laughing
Hope carries him on fairy wings
Down the stairs to the den at six a.m.
And giggles as he whispers
""You know it's gonna be there.""
Hope fills his eyes with wonder
As he surveys the packages
As he selects the first one
As he tears through
The paper
And the ribbon
And the tissue
Hope squeals with eagerness
And tells the little boy that he
Will find his new train
And when the little boy finds
A sweater instead
Hope never lets up
""Just open the next one,
You know it's gonna be there.""

Until there are no packages left
And the floor is littered with
Empty boxes
And hope never says another word
While he sneaks out the window
Smiling from ear to ear
Leaving the little boy alone to answer
The knock at the door
Hope swirls around the young man's head
Before sitting in the seat beside him
Giddy and laughing
Hope carries him on fiery hooves
Down the road to the party at eight p.m.
And giggles as he whispers
""You know they're gonna be there.""

As he surveys the room
As he greets the first one
As he tears through
The awkwardness
And the doubt
And the tension

And tells the young man that he
Will find his new friends

A closed society instead

You know they're gonna be there.""

Giddy and laughing
Hope carries him on a magic carpet
Across the gap in the bed to the arms of his wife at ten p.m.
And giggles as he whispers
""You know she's gonna be there.""

Walking arm and arm down the cold sanitary corridor
Warm and caring

Down the hall to the semi-private room

A stroke instead

""Just come one more time,
You know he's gonna be OK.""

And hope never says another word

Smiling from ear to ear
Leaving the son alone to answer
The knock at the door
And the little boy
And the young man
And the husband
And the son
Go to the door
Looking to see if hope has come back
And pain walks in
And pain doesn't swirl
And pain doesn't giggle
And pain doesn't jump on the bed
And pain doesn't hold his hand
With giddy excitement or warm assurances
Pain just makes his intentions known
And tells them to wake up
There never was a train
And the friends would only let you down
And love is conditional
And your Father is dying
And after making his announcements
Pain doesn't sneak through the window
Grinning from ear to ear
He walks into the kitchen and
Makes a sandwich
And says, ""You should get to know me.
I'm gonna be here for a while.""
And pain doesn't whisper
And pain doesn't tempt them
To keep looking, and greeting and reaching out
He just sits there eating his sandwich
And asking for a glass of milk
And perhaps a cookie
If it's not too much trouble
And pain doesn't carry them
Anywhere on anything
He just follows them around
Never more than a few paces back
And pain reminds them
That he's gonna be there
When they wake up
And when they go to sleep
And if they want him to leave
They're gonna have to ask him to go
And they better mean it
Because if they don't
He'll be back
And he'll knock on that door
As soon as hope sneaks out
The window"

1487,Emotion,HopePoemsHopeIsNotLostPoembyJessicaMillsaps,"When the desperation hit
When the people cried in the streets
When everything felt at loss
Hope stayed, even though fleaing would be easier
When the eyes were full of tears.
When kids and families were torn apart
By that last desperate grasp
Hope tried
When all else gave up
When all else backed off
When people lost all they had
Hope flew
When they cried
When the world was shocked with desperation and dispair
When nothing seemed good
Hope worked
When those four planes crashed
When the buildings fell
When the lives were lost
Hope was there
Hope was only a tiny glimmer
Hope was still there
She ran to those who needed her
She worked to help
When all else failed
Hope didn't
She flew through us all
Letting us know, we still had her
We just needed to look hard enough
Hope was there
Hope remembers"

As long as you have a little you are still doing okay.
Everything will be alright, the sun will start to shine,
Spring brings more hope but you may just have to look harder for it sometimes.
So, do not fret and do not cry,
The warmth of the air, the blue of the sky
Will dry your tears most of the time."

1491,Emotion,HopePoemsHopeIsATatteredFlagPoembyCarlSandburg,"Hope is a tattered flag and a dream of time.
Hope is a heartspun word, the rainbow, the shadblow in white
The evening star inviolable over the coal mines,
The shimmer of northern lights across a bitter winter night,
The blue hills beyond the smoke of the steel works,
The birds who go on singing to their mates in peace, war, peace,
The ten-cent crocus bulb blooming in a used-car salesroom,
The horseshoe over the door, the luckpiece in the pocket,
The kiss and the comforting laugh and resolve—
Hope is an echo, hope ties itself yonder, yonder.
The spring grass showing itself where least expected,
The rolling fluff of white clouds on a changeable sky,
The broadcast of strings from Japan, bells from Moscow,
Of the voice of the prime minister of Sweden carried
Across the sea in behalf of a world family of nations
And children singing chorals of the Christ child
And Bach being broadcast from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania
And tall skyscrapers practically empty of tenants
And the hands of strong men groping for handholds
And the Salvation Army singing God loves us…."
1492,Emotion,HopePoemsWithFaithAndHopePoembyErnestineNorthover,"The tears fall, but no one's there to heed them,
The heart it mourns, but no one sees the hurt.
An emptiness has seeped into the brainstem,
One's feeling dazed, and no longer alert.
Such desolation haunts one's whole persona,
What can one do, and just where can one go,
You feel as if you've now become a loner,
How droplets, when they're prompted, freely flow.
To cry can be a painful kind of action,
One weeps for someone one has loved so well,
Yet grieving gives release, if just a fraction,
Which heals the ache and lets sadness dispel.
Only time will ease such utter sorrow,
That comes from losing someone Oh, so dear,
But with the dawning of each new tomorrow,
With faith and hope you'll find a panacea.

That while my footsteps tread the flowery sod
And the great woods embower me, and white dawn
And purple even sweetly lead me on
From day to day, and night to night, O God,
My life shall no wise miss the light of love;
But ever climbing, climb above
Man's one poor star, man's supine lands,
Into the azure steadfastness of death,
My life shall no wise lack the light of love,
My hands not lack the loving touch of hands;
But day by day, while yet I draw my breath,
And day by day, unto my last of years,
I shall be one that has a perfect friend.
Her heart shall taste my laughter and my tears,
And her kind eyes shall lead me to the end."
1494,Emotion,DepressionPoemsAStateOfDepressionPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"Speak out my dear
Why hath thou in a state of depression?
Speak out my dear
I stand here waiting for thy confession
Depression is not a sign of weakness
Neither an indication of madness
I stand here not to judge you
Simply to take heed to what is true
Depression is not a crime
It only calls for love through time
Depression is a silent voice
Rooted deep inside to stop a crying noise
Speak out my dear
Why hath thou in a state of depression?
Speak out my dear
I stand here waiting for thy confession
What have you lost along the way?
Retrace your steps, I say
Who have you lost?
Take heart, everything in life must rust
What is it you want?
Grant me a permit in your hunt
But first of all let me be blunt
Condemn yourself not for your mistakes
That is what it takes for you to be awake
Life is meant to be messy and greasy
The road is not meant to be easy
Speak out my dear
Why hath thou in a state of depression?
Speak out my dear
I stand here as a friend
My compassionate heart is yours to lend
Merely to give you inspiration
And redeem you of your depression
Thus, speak out my dear!
Why hath thou in a state of depression?

A state of agitated depression
Now facing the liquid depression
Like a closed session
Needing medical attention
Making my agitated confession
Liquid depression my obsession
Liquid depression my only material possession
Years of oppression before the recession
See the expression of my depression
Liquid depression leaving a facial impression
At it's own discretion

And a singer in a jam session
Or a poet at the blog talk radio session
You can't forget the internal impression
The repossession of my liquid depression

no pain no gain

it hurts my heart
it has and it hurts

what could it be?
well it could be
my father drinking?
yes that's it

to me being depressed is my dad
and his drinking
so now what do I do
Hell is so bad
well you need to go
and talk to your dad
I know it seems hard
and you are scared
but don't be afraid
if he loves you then he cares
So that's what I did
and I am no longer sad
but I can tell you one thing
I am no longer in hell... and no longer sad

Eating me alive, and depression
Is lying inside....
As the thin dark ropes falling from the sky
The brown knots are dancing in front of my eyes

'God, am I losing my mind? '
I hold my blade and cut my unloved wrist
It's bleeding still but I can't feel relief yet
I ran to the balcony as am looking down and wondering
If the height is enough to smash my head over the floor?
Will it be enough to break my out through this door?
The monster inside my head is calling my name
And asking me to suicide...
It screams inside and then orders me to die
Die dying...
You are not alive
Just cut it deeper and die...you don't want to survive

What is happening with me,
Leave me alone I say, let me be,
Everything gets to me this misery,
I must divert my thought on the good things when negativity pulls me down,
I must think positive and redesign my life,
Yes, this is what I must do,
Burying my head under covers is not the way for me or you,

It all takes some time,
But before you know it things will work out just fine."
1503,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionMonsterPoembyCHARMAINESIMPSON,"Spinning faster and faster, spiraling down, down,
Depression creates a suffocating heaviness
which consumes and smothers your entire being.
As i recall this space in time,
it seems as though viewing an experience that belongs
to a stranger.
My physical body defeated,
so tired there is no movement.
Eratic thought patterns that make no sense.
Who is controlling these thoughts?
My mind is in control,
which now belongs to the very dark powerful emotion of
Depression.
This emotion gathers together, confusion, negativity, loss,
misery, self hatred, guilt, and doubt,
all joining forces and circling faster, causing dizziness
and taking me down to a cold, dark place full of sadness.
This sadness so overwhelming it comes crashing,
over and over like pounding waves,
its too dark to see anything,
the next wave crashes over with no time for a breath
before the next wave floods tears that fall
as though they will never stop falling.
Nothing makes any sense -
I am lost, it is dark, it is cold, I am scared,
in this darkness i fall deeper into this nightmare.

Borrowed for cries
Tears are all shy
Like wings that won't fly
Like eyes that won't see
Like lips that won't speak
Like lungs that won't breathe
Like freedom that's not free
It won't just pass through
It is really stuck on you
Like glue
Like gum on a shoe
It's like an eclipse
Let the words pass through your lips
Let the tears in your eyes stick
Making the stress in your mind slip
I know it's like being raped
Like all your thoughts are being taped
Like you have to keep your fists shaped
Like the tears in you have turned to rain
Well this whole thing is not your fault
Your life is not at a stop
There is a way to crack this vault
There is a word you could call
Your life is not all flat
There's a chance you could catch
There is a way, that is a fact
Depression is what caused all that"

fuzzy clouds of sorrow and regret

unable to concentrate on anything but my pulse
I will myself to numbness, nothingness

I see faces but don’t recognize my reflection.
I want to scream but haven’t the energy,
so instead I bury myself under my blankets of despair
and pray that the world will go away.

1506,Emotion,DepressionPoemsTheDarkCloudOfDepressionPoembyMichaelShepherd,"The dark cloud.
It sits around your head
or inside it, more like.
Around your mind,
or inside it.
Around your heart,
or inside it.
Does it reach your knees?
Seems like it, some days.
Your toenails perhaps?
If you let it, it has a voice.
Please don’t listen to it;
that’s really dangerous;
it makes general statements
as if it knows you better than you know yourself
like, ‘your…’ - no, it claims to  BE you -
so, it’s ‘MY life is pointless..’
Have you noticed, it’s
never in front of you,
always somewhere behind you,
whispering over your shoulder
so on a bad day, it’s there in the bed with you
the moment you awake; not of course
in kissing range, that might be fun – but behind you,
murmuring in a bedly voice
‘WE are really down this morning aren’t WE? ’
or it catches up with you in the bathroom
or a bit later, like when you review the day’s appointments
or start out for work.
The First Aid for depression is of course well known
(to everyone else, at some other time…) :
put some music on, sing in the shower,
sit in the brightest light,
toast your hidden beautiful self
in orange juice; take some vigorous exercise,
seek out good company in
someone or something; be
good company yourself, for someone else..
they all work, for a time; but don’t you wish
for the classic fairy tale encounter –
there you are walking through the dark wood
of the dark cloud, and suddenly
the monster springs out in front of you
in all its horror; for the first time
you meet it face to face; it’s
terrifying, but a curious relief:
now you know it’s not you after all,
but something else; you look it in the eye,
you don’t retreat, but march towards it,
say Boo (for linguistic reasons, rather abstruse)
and as you get nearer and nearer to it, the monster
gets smaller and smaller, until…
and then, marching back
triumphant with a spring in your step,
you may feel like
nailing it with a poem, to say
wow I’ve survived;
have a great day!"

But we all wish that the depression would fly away just like angels would!"
1509,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionPoembyKristenFreeland,"Depression sets in
When you wanna die
You're not willing to try
Depression sets in
When you cant take it
And all you wanna do is cry
You're seventeen
And all you can think
Is this life is long and hard.
There's gotta be something
There's gotta be a way
To stay happy
And never have to cry
Never have to be so upset
Where you just wanna die
But nothing is like that
Nothing can make you happy
And depression sets in"
1510,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionPoembyDarrenHarris,"Depression is running through my head,
These thoughts make me think of death,
A darkness which blanks my mind,
A walk through the graveyard, what can I find?
Black shadows walk in between the graves,
How many lives have not been saved?
Six feet under if not more,
How I’d like to go down and explore,
The feeling of lying in a box,
I can’t get out, is it locked?
Is it day or is it night?
Are birds singing or have bats taken to flight?
I know one day this is where I’ll go,
Am I afraid? I don’t think so!
Will I be able to explore the feeling of death?
After I’ve taken my last breath?
Or will I be a shadow in between the graves?
Will I know how many lives have not been saved?
After this life is there another one?
With a different moon and a different sun,
I won’t go to hell as I’m already there,
A place full of sadness, a place full of despair,
So there’s nothing to live for, no future no past,
So I might as well end it, end this life at last."
1511,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionPoembybrandireissig,"depression is not what you want in your life
depression is not the answer to your problems
depression effects your mind and your thoughts
depression is anger and lashing out at people
depression is something you feel when no else cares about you"
1512,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionDestroyedMyLifePoembyAnastasiaMimi,"Depression destroyed my life.
It told me I was no good.
It told me I was all bad.
It told me I was not loved.
It told me I didn't deserve treatment.
It told me I deserved to die.
Depression destroyed my life.
I listened to what it was saying.
I told myself I was no good.
I told myself I wasn't loved because I was bad.
I didn't seek treatment to feel better.
I tried to kill myself for his entertainment.
Depression destroyed me.
I am left picking up the pieces.
He has left me alone.
He said it was to late for help now.
He left me scared and confused.
He is still here.
He wants to keep me.
And he will keep me.
Depression destroyed my life.
All I am asking is that it does not destroy yours."
1513,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionPoembyZoeSEM,"Depression in so many
It's always so sad to see
The numbers are uncanny
Just take a look at me
So many in pain unseen
As depression numbers rise
Sometimes life can be so mean
Just look into my eyes
Afraid to go home
Don't know how to deal
You're feeling so alone
This is how I feel"
1514,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionPoembyESPNCHICK,"depression is when you are sucked into a cold lonely world
where you don't have anyone to love
no one by you're side
you wish you could die
cutting with tears
you want help but no one can say anything right
you're words are cold
depression leads you down a broken road
you keep walking forever down that road
you're heart is bleeding from all the pain people has caused
its a disease from people you love
they hurt you so bad and they act like they care
they don't know what its like being you
they never dealt with anything like this
depression pulls you under
drowning in you're own tears and blood
not even a single rose can fix whats been broken
you're so alone so far away from paradise
wishing that death would soon arrive
depression hurts like hell"
1515,Emotion,DepressionPoemsYolindasDepressionPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"Yolinda often was depressed
she then stayed home, inside her nest.
To help her illness she used gin
it quickly did restore her grin
but alcohol's welcome effect
was not expected to correct
her melancholy disposition
thus it required repetition.
She managed thus for many years
depression and some other fears.
And on her deathbed she required
the liquid she so much admired.
It helped, this time she drank a quart
before she left for God's resort."
1516,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionPoembyKaylaMclendon,"Depression is like a wave pulling you further in
You don't feel up to facing anyone or anything
Depression is a huge emphasis on feeling sad and low
You feel like you're in a dark place with no where else to go
Depression is like you're falling deeper into a blackhole
Your mind feels violated and as though you have no control
Depression is having little energy and lack of motivation
you feel tired and don't want to engage in conversation
Depression is used in the wrong context by naive people
They don't understand the seriousness of how it affects people
Depression is isolation, withdrawl, low self-esteem, and much more
You will never understand it unless you've been through it before"
1517,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDeepestDepressionRevisedPoembykrissibwilliams,"Staring at the walls...at the pictures that hang there
each photo...of it all
each step of our relationship..that started, with lust, wanting and care
the last picture that is hung
showing the ultimate happiness, of us being in love
I GET THE DEEPEST DEPRESSION
just staring at these things...
the photos on the wall
and the finger that holds my engagement ring
looking around the room, looking at it all
now just filled with dread, n, doom
the dieing roses in the crystal vase
marks the symbol..of the day
when it all was lost, n, went away
the photo album that we made
starts with the pictures of our 1st date, where it started
the last picture is of us, in love
3 days, b4 love was departed
is of the day you proposed, look at it, we are so in love
a red box that had matched
the teddy bear with the red herat attached
in which you gave to me b4 the proposal, inside it held the ring
to unite our love, to bring
us 2gether, from now til 4ever
I GET THE DEEPEST DEPRESSION
JUST LOOKING AT THESE THINGS
the 2 wine glasses,4m which we drank, sealing the deal
a begining to our new fate
n to our proposal, we gave, love cheers, and thanks
the card thats hung,4m the dieing flowers in theyre crystal vase
that you gave.....to me..b4 you kneeled onto 1 knee
uttering the most 4 words a man can say...
all of it is now gonn..just taken away
just in such a short time....3 damn days
I GET THE DEEPEST DEPRESSION
JUST HOLDING THESE THINGS....
the pictures, the wine glass
the teddy bear with the red heart attached
the photo album, the 1st photo, in which we started
the courtship, that blossomed into a beautiful relationship
the last photo, hung on the wall...its left me so broken hearted
the cards i kept in a shoe box, from you, giving to me through
no reason @ all, my birthday, holidays, n anniversary
each card filled with words of love, each card, having its own diversity
I GET THE DEEPEST DEPRESSION
JUST HOLDING, N, TOUCHING, OR LOOKING AT ALL OUR THINGS
to the life we had, the home we made
that just vanished...poof, went away.....
DEEPEST DEPRESSION OVER EVERYTHING....
ESPECIALIALLY THE FINGER THAT WEARS MY ENGAGEMENT RING....."

She smiles and shows good impressions
Never does she show her depression
And to fake good impressions
Even though her smiles are fake
She still hides her mistakes"
1519,Emotion,DepressionPoemsManicDepressionPoembyIwishiwasasinvisableashemademefeel,"Tears on my pillow,
cuts on my wrist,
use a razor,
if bleeding resists...
Resist temptation,
to seek help and advice,
let pain be your friend,
let pain be your life.
Don't eat food at all,
become fragile and weak,
self mutilation,
forget how to speak...
Listen to the voices,
the ones in your head,
they say they hate you and want you dead!
Finally through the darkness,
you see hope,
a closet, a chair,
a short length of rope...
After you fall your painful life ends,
Manic depression your only true friend! !"
1520,Emotion,DepressionPoemsLetNotGoDepressionDepressionDepressionDepressionPoembyUdiahwitnesstoYah,"I am loosed, I am free
I have no responsibility
No longer to be found
The shackles and chains that had me bound
A new life waits ahead
It is the unknown what I most dread
Though I'm free as a dove
I'd surrender if bound by your love
Let not go is my plea
Please bring again my captivity
Without you I am lost
Hold onto me no matter the cost

1521,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionIsnTObviousSuicideIsPoembyAmyLouiseKerswell,"Depression isn't obvious but suicide is.
My pain nobody sees.
My my mangled body they shall see.
My head was all but a mess.
Depression overtaking me.
Suicide was to be my bid for freedom.
Becuase deppression isn't obvious but suicide is.
Depression is never obvious even when its staring them in the face.
But now suicide will be obvious  how can it not?
Now my life is too much to bear.
Suicide I shall commit.
Now its obvious but its all too late."
1522,Emotion,DepressionPoemsVillanelleOnDepressionPoembyBeatriceDahlen,"Depression is a fact of life for me.
As much a part of life as food and air,
It hovers like a dreaded entity.
It scatters joys like useless stale debris,
And sews the ashes of my dreams in gloom.
Depression is a fact of life for me.
It poises like a shadowing banshee
With somber wings just waiting to enshroud.
It hovers like a dreaded entity,
And I can almost always guarantee
Secreted in my spectral holidays
Depression is a fact of life for me.
My life becomes a frequent abductee
Purloined by mirthless bird of prey
It hovers like a dreaded entity..
A vulture pouncing when my back is turned,
But hidden, and not easily discerned.
Depression is a fact of life for me
It hovers like a dreaded entity."
1523,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionIsPoembyJodieLouisePollock,"Depression is Loving someone with nothing in return,
Depression is Slowly living instead of jumping head first,
Depression is Acknowledging the mistake but without learn,
Depression is Not trying, giving into your lifes curse.
Depression is Cutting and cutting thinking you cant stop,
Depression is Staying quiet thinking no-one will care,
Depression is Floating around with the desire to drop,
Depression is Ignoring the people who always seem to be there.
Depression is Trying to end the life youve been given,
Depression is Watching other people watch you,
Depression is Giving up instead of being hard driven,
Depression is Depression, do you feel it too?"
1524,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionPoembyJessicaLicklider,"everyone sufers from it
which makes us feel like sh.t
there r different kinds
some some people lose their minds
some people no how to handle it
and then don't think and end it
people that have depression
may make pain an obsession
its something u can't run away from
suicide is the way for some
people take their lives
because suicide thrives
some can't take it so they take a gun
im surprised it don't ruin everyone
depression it hurts
and the pain just exerts"
1525,Emotion,DepressionPoemsAnotherDepressionPoembyShirleyHanley,"Oh my God the pain
of desperation
within the walls
of my depression...
the greyness of it all
a world awash in muted tones,
blandness as its epitome
blocking life's rainbows
from existence within my memory
reaching deeply with suffocating tendrils
that wrap my soul in confusion
and disgrace...
a great sadness
abounds here, locked
behind closed doors, awaiting
loves anxious arms
that come no more...

At least you're not depressed.
If you say you're upset because you're depressed...
At least you're not in physical pain.
If you're upset because you're in physical pain...
At least you have your mind.
If you're upset because you're tired, depressed, in physical pain, and in danger of losing your mind...
At least you're alive.
And, if you're upset because you're dying...
At least when you're dead you won't have to worry about all of the above."

i sit still and cry
hoping everyday
i change my destructive way

because i am drowned in sorrow
no one knows the tears i shed
while lying in my bed
every night i prey
to feel better the next day
but never stopping to think
maybe this is my way"
1529,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionPoembytouyang,"Depression is the sorrow in your heart…
Depression is the feeling of being alone…
Depression is knowing your best isn’t enough…
Depression is knowing no one cares if your dead or alive…
Depression is the hate and anger you get when life is too hard…
Depression is when you feel like the worlds on your shoulders…
Depression is the feeling that you get when you get when you know
That what ever you do no one cares and it doesn’t matter…
Depression is knowing when you tried tried and tried again but failed…
Depression is knowing that when you are dead no one will even remember your name…
Depression hits hard and harder every day…
Depression is the feeling of dying slowly every day…

1532,Emotion,DepressionPoemsTheDepressionOfThe1930sPoembyMargaretRodkey,"The depression of the 1930's was the time of my childhood days,
There were a lot of worries and hardships in many ways.
Whatever time people could spare, they would help each other out,
Bad times also came when there was a draught.
The depression of the 1930's our parents would help make quilts of all kinds,
They would work long hours, day and night, it was alot on their minds.
Fathers would work on the W.P.A. just to make ends meet,
Breaking stones was very hard work, some of them fell to their feet.
The depression of the 1930's there were problems about work, severe
winters and war,
People never know from day to day what may be in store,
There were children of all ages, sick with an illness,
Some of them passed away with the long nights of stillness.
The depression of the 1930's made it bad for all ages,
Work was scare, there was pay of low wages.
During the depression, we all learned how to survive,
A lot of people shared the hardships by showing love and being alive.
The depression of the 1930's will be in my heart for the rest of my life,
I, Margaret L. Hockenberry, now Margaret l. Rodkey lived in those hardships
of struggle and strife
My parents were loving and caring in every way,
They taught me to respect people and show them we care."
1533,Emotion,DepressionPoemsPostnatalDepressionPoembyTeedyDawn,"I fear my little child.
I fear that she will not feed and grow strong and healthy,
I fear that she will stop breathing when I am out of the room or selfishly asleep,
I fear that she will become ill because of something I have done or did not do,
I fear that she will be in pain and I will not know why.
I fear that her father will reject her,
I fear that her father will reject me,
I fear that her father will compete for her love and that she will love him more,
I fear that her father will be distant and that she will not love him enough.
I fear that others will think that I am incompetent,
I fear that others will assume that I am capable,
I fear that others will force upon me unhelpful or unwanted advice,
I fear that others will believe I can cope.
I fear the loneliness of endless days without contact,
I fear the emptiness of endless nights without love,
I fear the weakness of endless days without proper meals,
I fear the weariness of endless nights without sleep.
I fear inexperience.
I fear uncertainty.
I fear guilt.
I fear despair.
I fear my little child."
1534,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionPoembyFredBabbin,"There is a rat
I call Depression
Inside me,
Eating at my innards.
The pain goes to my throat
So I am choking on my tears
My tears of blood.
Would that I could
Write of something else,
Would that I could.
And I am so very tired
If I could only end it all
Looking at words on the page
that reflect back to me
my misery.
And where am I?"
1535,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionPoembyMandyLee,"I'm scared that I have fallen,
into that rift yet once again.
The black hole that I had feared,
the one i rotted in as I lain.
Even worse to me is the thought,
that I never did ever climb out.
And all that I have been,
is merely a voiceless shout.
From a depth too far to reach,
in a land too far below.
A place I tried to run from,
Yet is a place I always go."
1536,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionAMixOfPoemsAndMinePoembywickedwacked,"Depression is a fight
Depression is a flight
Depression is a thief
That should be locked up
Depression steals your view on life
And even your very life
It brings to you seclusion
Worse than that of a grave
And darkness
Worse than that of a cave
It keeps you away
It doesn’t allow you to be gay
It keeps you back
It doesn’t allow any comeback
It keeps you pressured
It keeps you shattered
It brings to you tearing tears
With depression there is no in-between
You’re in a dark tunnel
With no light to be seen
Depression we say is a selfish state of mind
But when we get depressed there is no other we can find
Depression is predator and we’re all its prey
Tick tock tick tock goes the clock
Its only a matter of time
Before the ultimate climb"
1537,Emotion,DepressionPoemsdepressionPoembyBrokenHearts,"Depression is …
Feeling alone
Depression is …
Knowing this will never change
Depression is …
Knowing your best isn’t good enough
Depression is…
Knowing nothing you do matters
Depression is …
Realizing your best days have gone
Depression is …
Looking forward to the end
Depression is…
Knowing no one really cares that you are looking forward to the end
Depression is…
Is knowing no one cares if you take your own life"
1538,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionPoembyBeckyGinn,"A black hole, closes in
Blocking the light, cold within.
A swallowing mass, empty and black
Tears me apart, supermassive attack.
Icy hands rip out my heart
I’m so messed up, i’m torn apart.
I cannot breathe, it’s suffocation
I’m on my own, in isolation.
The darker it gets, the less I see,
I’m trapped, there’s no way out for me.
Behind a smile, in me hide,
No-one knows, i’m dying inside.
Yet I wake each morning and carry on
I will not cry, i must be strong!"
1539,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDrugsDepressionPoembyRoseMcCraven,"When you try to make it better
With the truths you hold so close
And the lies made up apart of you
To the ones you hate the most
Something screams inside I'll never change
When your thoughts are painted black
Someone chose for me to be this way...
And there's only me to thank
And when your heart falls in the way you think
There's really no turning back
And the ones you think you thought you loved
Could never judge the way you act
You've played this part for way to long
Now the center stage is clear
Grab my wrist and hold it tight
Tell me nothing's left to fear...
I thought words could explain the way I feel
But now I know that's just a lie
Grab my wrist and hold it tight
I'm coming home tonight
When I go just leave the door unlocked
I'll make it worth my while
When the high gets low
And my conviction stands
Just look at me and smile..."

I must be fed.
I need the taste of your blood.

I love how it flows like a river.
Always making you quiver.
You thought you were so stroung.
But you couldnt of been any more wrong.
I am your soul.
I am keeping you whole.
I love to watch you drool.
You are nothing but a fool.
I will never go.
This you must know.
I am your history your now and I am the futer.
I am your second minute and hour.
I am an insane cannibal.
Just like a crazed animal.
I will eat you from the inside out.
This you will have no doubt.
Do you know who I am?
I am no saint I am no lamb.
Have you become wise?
That I am the devil in diguise."
1541,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionPoembybriefrenderingsJoeFazio,"Be not depressed. Depression, is the thief of happiness.
Like all thieves', he must be combated and defeated.
Like all thieves', depression must be fought with great
vigor and resolve.
Depression, the dark cloak of reason, that blocks most
rational thought and any chance of happiness.
Depression, an emotional straight jacket, confining the
depressed to an infusion of negativity and haplessness.
Depression, withdrawal of social interaction and an
elongated state of sadness.
Depression, a disease that like a cancer, eats away
at your very being.
Depression, a desperate battle between living...and
merely existing.
Depression, an enemy, that one must seek help
to do battle with.
Do not stand ideally by, for depression, will steal your
very soul.
The enemies of depression, are social interaction, happiness, love, understanding and seeking medication or help in some form. DO IT!

teeth clattered under the ground.
Handcuffed you walk in inequality
to qualify for hanging till dead.
I may not tell myself
what was happening to me.
Moving in opposite direction
the bird was able to catch the smell.
My stance was always making a stroke
in the canvas of a tormentor
abbreviated in a muscular arm
starting violences of sleep.
Corralled in doorframes, keeping
the lights off, this was the nemesis
for asking for the change. Haungered, the
human being, absorbed by the
absence of chains which were not
coming in sight.

“Depression is anger without enthusiasm.”
I don’t believe that for a second,
I think depression is loneliness,
Feeling so lonely inside
Even if the world surrounds you
And knowing you cant blame anyone but yourself
But that’s just me.
And even worse
When the people you’d think know you best,
Don’t even notice.
Depression to me is
An overwhelming feeling
of defeat
Feeling that somehow,
In a game, you verses life
You lose
And there is no
Double or nothing
Or a such thing as re-do’s
Some of us accept it
And try other strategies
Others are left
Only to dwell
On what tactics they could have changed."

She's half crazed, animal like, out of control and wild"
1552,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionShowsRealityPoembyAnaxxx,"My knees are so weak
Yet running
Running
For what?
Does it worth all that?
Why should I spent my years
Working
Learning
Searching for means to live
If I know
Inside me
I won't enjoy living it
Running, running...
For what I'm searching?
For cure?
I enjoy being sick!
For happiness?
It will never exist
For the reason that I'm still here?
I cannot find it out yet
What am I doing?
Why am still running
It's the time, to be selfish
To think of my own
Way
To live!
I'm still here?
Why should I care again for this life?
So many chances I gave
But it just won't get better...
Why am I still asking for help?
Why am still seeking it from this mortal world?
It won't give me the answer,
It won't give me a a damn
Why am I still trying to come back upon my feet?
For that I'm sick to seek
Why should I go on with  it
When I know that it is just a half empty pot of blood?
If it won't hurt you
It will just break upon the floor
Why should I even keep on repeating
The same everyday?
I'm sick of u!
you call ur self life? ?
You are just one big lie
This perfect solution...
The words upon my body..
I engrave, razor and pain
A perfect poem to write...
words,
are bleeding
till the last word
the last dropp of blood, falls
it will hit the floor
to draw the last line of this image
that is showing  the opposite of what u see
the choice that was hidden for many years
I'll  remove it to the surface
for others to see it, to realize
happiness is by..
Living our own death everyday,"
1553,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionAbuseAndSuicidePoembyAdrianCordova,"A wind blows across your face, leaving a itch on your nose.
You reach up to scratch it, but your arm doesn't move.
You look down only to see your skin is made of glass.
You panic, and suddenly feel out of breath.
Taking shallow breaths you begin to worry.
You know that the slightest movement will cause you to shatter into pieces
The wind continues, making your itch worse.
You know your going to sneeze, but what can you do?
Then it happens, your body brakes into pieces, but the pain never comes though, why?
Because you woke up.
You remember a summer as a little kid, playing hide and go seek with your parents.
You decide to go hide in the barn.
Hiding behind the haystack there you wait.
Sometime later, the stale smell of hay is replaced by a rancid sticky smell that you remember but can't place.
When you emerge, you've discovered your parents laying across the barn floor.
Their throats have been ripped out.
You scream and try to run.
But it's to late, they rise and bring you into their dark embrace.
Then you wait for the inevitable, for the pain of the teeth sinking into you skin.
But it never came, you know why?
Because you woke up.
One day you look into the mirror, sadness and frustration pour out of you eyes.
You want it all to go away.
And yet you find yourself thinking of everyone around you, your friends who care about.
And somehow I'm put into the mix, mabye it's because deep down you could possible know that I love you.
Then with an anger you rip your wrists apart with your nails.
Locking your bathroom door, you whisper something.
It sounded like “I'm sorry”
Then you get in your tub of ice water.
An hour later your still there, your cloths stained by your own blood.
The tub doesn't seem to be full of water anymore…
You wait for the hypothermia, but it never came.
You know why?
Because you died forty-five minutes ago from blood loss.
So, if anyone knows the answer, how can you survive depression and abuse, but not yourself?"
1554,Emotion,DepressionPoemsASlaveToDepressionPoembyAldoKraas,"I am a slave
To depression
Because I have to live with it
And that is a hard thing to do
Also that is a hard thing to keep under control
For me"
1555,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDeepDepressionAndTheLackOfAnyYearningPoembyTedSheridan,"I remember as a child I had a deep seeded fear of heights
I would envision my demise long prior to even a possible fall
Once as a teenage boy I knocked a front tooth from my mouth
When I jumped twenty feet into a drainage ditch next to our house
My mother rushed me to the dentist with my tooth in milk
He soon restored my youthful smile
But did little if any at all to replace my fear of falling
As I still panicked whenever I even stood close to a ledge....
For the last sixty years I have managed to cope more or less
Always waking up before any tragedy occurred
But last night upon being led to this cliff in my life
I jumped and have not landed yet
as I knew it was a bottomless pit I was entering...."
1556,Emotion,DepressionPoemsWindsOfDepressionPoembyPdishere,"Twilight declares its arrival
The waves crash against the rocks
The traffic moves slowly
The crowds buzz by
We can't look eye to eye.
The mood was light
Now silence hangs low
Thoughts create a tornado
From him to her and her to him
Suddenly melancholy spurts
And words follow.
The winds of depression
From the fathoms of the ocean
Swayed-
Our mood
Our talks
Our thoughts
Our love
For a while
And no more.
Lights glowed bright
Waves calmed
Traffic smoothed
Crowds did not bother
Luckily,
Oceans have a shore
Winds changes course
The winds died down
Depression sucked out
Eyes found the strength
To look at another of their kind
Only you were around
With a heart full of love.

1557,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionIsAWorldPoembyFerretGirl,"Depression is a world
Depression leaves you lost
Depression drops you into a never ending black hole
You want to get help
But you can't
When you do
You wish you didn't
Depression leaves you numb
With fear
Depression leaves you no hope
No ambition
Nothing to look forward to
Tears well in your eyes
Depression leaks out
Out into the open"
1558,Emotion,DepressionPoemsWarOnDepressionPoembyFerretGirl,"Depression is a fight
Or a flight
Depression is a theif
That should be locked up
Depression steals...
Happiness
Motivation
Sleep
Your appetite
It steals your view on life
It steals how you view yourself
Sometimes it even steals your life"
1559,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionPoembyStephanMcLean,"I scream but there's no sound,
I cry but there's no tears,
Is this life,
Or am i isolated with emotion.
No one is listening,
I dont think anyone cares,
Is this life,
Or hell with normal people.
I try to act normal,
But no one know's the thoughts inside my head,
My so called life,
Filled with thoughts of being better off dead."
1560,Emotion,DepressionPoemsTheBlackDogDepressionPoembyDallasNyberg,"There’s a black dog scratching at my door - demanding he come in
Although I try to ignore him - the black dog always wins.
Once inside he haunts my soul and dictates my thoughts and deeds
and like a fool I heed him and I pander to his greed.
Those who’ve never met him would doubt his presence here
They scoff his very mention and scold my tears and fears.
Little do they realise that my world is falling down
and they just dismiss my feelings and ignore that I’m around
Late at night the black dog lurks and hinders me from rest
depression overwhelms me and my heart sinks in my chest
the tears I cry are done alone - and pray - never in a crowd
for a man to cry its just not done - such weakness - not allowed
Get a grip the wise ones cry - grow up and act your age
Only you can fix it – just turn another page!
If was that simple then it would be done and dusted
but the black dog says pay no heed - no ones to be trusted.
So on it goes each dreary day - this world of pain and sorrow,
I just wish I could go to sleep and not awake tomorrow
but the black dogs bark will bring me back to endure another day
where my sun has lost its wondrous shine and my sky is dank and grey
I have a sinking feeling that the black dog has a plan
that will test the very fibre of this backward sliding man
he will of course suggest that I just end this stupid life
and he will then simply wander off and destroy another’s life
until then I must pay him heed and succumb to his demands
and resign myself to tears and fears and make no worthwhile plans
and when my time on earth is done and my wasted life’s gone cold
you’ll have no need to feed my dog - he has feasted on my soul."
1561,Emotion,DepressionPoemsTheDepressionPoembycarlybachor,"Depression takes over my body.
making me dizzy, sick, and sad.
as i walk the halls with a blank face
i'm dieing inside with so many thoughts it takes over my body.
i walk the halls with tears running down my cheek.
with black merky makeup running down my blank expressionless face.
i woundered if anyone noticed
whenever my teacher sounds my name, my heart starts to ache, surprised someone actually knows i exist.
i wounder if anyone notices the depression taking over.
i smile blankly but crying endlessly inside.
no one knows 'me'.
all those lies catch up with me.
all those memories haunt me.
there's just so much that time cannot erase.
i wounder if it'll ever change.
i pray but then what happens?
Depression is my disease that doesn't go away.
i've tried many times to get rid of it but never did go away.
so i listen to music to get the pain away....tempararily."
1562,Emotion,DepressionPoemsMountDepressionPoembyVictorOsorio,"I'm worried about you
You want to be like me
Why? Don't you want to live?
It's very sacred up here
It controls your fear
It controls your pain
You'll look for help right away
Depression puts up a shield
You'll become what I am
If this is what you want
Join me and leave yourself behind
On second thought
It's crowded, stay where you are
Do not commit this sin
Think about Mount Depression
Now fall back to nowhere
I never want to see your face
Find yourself first
Everything else will fall into place."
1563,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionPoembyDavidKeig,"I got these pills for christmas
but not from santa claus
i got them from the pharmacy
with the greengrocer next door.
They're really very nice pills
i take them all the time
and even when its raining
i say the weather's fine.
They're very cost effective
about ten bucks a week
and for all the good they do for me
they're really very cheap.
I have to say i'm nervous
each time i get a scrip
i whisper what i'm buying
they often have to read my lips.
You see i suffer from depression
and i'm scared if people know
they think i'm all peculiar
and say 'sorry gotta go'.
It's quite lonely being lonely
it's lonely by myself
it's lonely being a victim
of imperfect mental health."
1564,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionPoembyChristinaPhan,"Depression
Hurt very much
I feel it when someone break my heart
I feel down and be by myself
You can't focus
You can't do anything
Don't you see baby
What you done to me
Depression
Can be when one of your family or relatives die
It's hard to face it
We have to deal with it and move on with our life
It going take one step at time
We can think back on good memerioes
Don't let this get to you too much
Depression"
1565,Emotion,DepressionPoemsWhenDepressionOwnsTheHeartPoembyDARRELKINCAID,".......It's a depression so deep it finds a way into the Soul,
traveling through every pore of your Heart.
A depression so enlarged, it encompasses every bit
of your Reality,
leaving that Reality, a mere cloudy memory.
A depression so dense, it compresses every will
you once had,
bowing you down to accept that will, as it's own.
A depression so devious it takes you piece by piece,
consuming, each piece,
day by day.
A depression so truly disheartening,
it Leaves You,
with no other emotions.
A depression so dangerous,
it slaughters,
Everything.
Inside.
Of You."
1566,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionPoembyAliChapman,"Depression is being lonely in a room full of people
Depression is being constantly tired but never able to sleep
Depression is longing to be with others yet not being able to cope with company
Depression makes you lose your appetite and eat yourself fat
Depression is smiling to hide the pain inside
Depression is when the soul dies but the body keeps on living
Depression is forgetting who you used to be
Depression is not knowing if you could survive without it
Depression is being sad when nothing is wrong
Depression is not caring whether you live or die
Depression is having no interest in the things you used to love
Depression is lying awake for hours in bed at night contemplating the best way to kill yourself only to realise that you can’t be bothered."
1567,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionHurtsPoembyjJOCAREY,"Depression hurts when you grow old
And life  has passed you by
No more dreams to think about
Or even wishes to come true
You lose a friend and then another and
There's no past to talk about
No laughter, only tears to shed
That others cannot see
Depression hurts no matter what you try
It breaks you down till nothing matters
Life doesn't matter either
You come or go, who cares
No one that really cares too much
No friend thats left to tell your troubles to
No love that puts its arms around you
And holds you close.
Why stay and sit in this old chair
With nothing to do day after day
Smoke cigarettes, why not
Its too late now to care
Goodbye to this life I would gladly say
Why God won't take me now
I do not know because he knows I want to go
Home with others that I love
There's more up there than down here
More love from friends in heaven
No friends do I count down here
Depression hurts, it hurts down deep inside
It breaks your heart and destroys your mind
Your thoughts are eratic and blown
Until the thoughts that used to come
Are gone forever,  depression hurts"
1568,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionASenryuPoembySandraMartyres,"Depression results
When ideas are supressed

1569,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionObsessionPoembyNathanLea,"My life seemed picture perfect with a loving wife and son, with a bun in the oven my life had just begun.
But my head couldn’t leave the pillow, getting out seemed too hard to swallow, I knew something major in my life really needed to be done.
When the warm embrace of death surrounds your tired soul.
My mind was outside my body and my head was full of fog.
I went to the doctor, I went to the shrink, and every one of them told me that I had to have a long think.
Do I want a life of shallow thoughts that were hidden by beer and pain, or do I want to be the person that I used to be again?
Strangers thought that I was self centred and emotionally inept. But what it was I really desired was love and self respect.
For so long I endeavoured to wear an emotional mask but the duration of time has eroded the comfort of this façade.
My persona had vanished, I was unable to make a decision. This uncontrollable process, devoured me of fulfilling my vision.
If I wanted to help my family, then first I needed to help myself, I checked into a specialised clinic, ashamed, disillusioned, and under a wrath of stealth.
I found the counselling a godsend, the nurses full of wit and charm, this empathy had a positive effect and restored my former humility and calm.
The loved ones in my life couldn’t understand and see, that at this point in my life the focus had to be me.
You don’t have to feel this way, you don’t have to feel like you can’t get help. You don’t have to wallow in your own misery just to find a sense of self. Help is available  in many different ways. Ownership of your state of mind, is the most difficult step to take.
Take pleasure in life’s subtle things, and acknowledge every success, place your self in the hands of experts, and you will benefit without duress.
I learned that life really was worth living, no matter what my state of mind. The deeper I looked inside myself the more demons I would find.
My thoughts were full of paranoia, of hatred and of fear, all my thoughts came from a cloud that was lodged between my ears.
When you’ve lost your job or can’t go to work and there is nothing to look forward too, when you’re too anxious just to leave the house and there is nothing you feel you can do. The future feels so helpless it seems like nothing could make it right. If sleep is non-existent and your thoughts keep you up all night.
I promise you will get better, just give help a chance, you may not see it clearly now but soon you’ll get up and dance. Dance with all your family, dance with all your friends but more important than anyone else dance within your self.
By Peter Bouboulos and Nathan Lea"
1570,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionPoembylouisrams,"sitting at home in deep thought
medical help i had sought.
a case of depression is what they said
so i went home and went to bed.
i refused to believe that's what it could be
but denial is always first, as was told to me.
how is that possible? how can it be?
i've always been happy and carefree.
he had said:
i keep my anger bottled up inside
it is something which i learned to hide.
no two cases are ever the same
and there's no reason to feel ashamed.
depression is a state of mind
which affects your body all the time.
it will make me sluggish and tired
and wanting to hide.
i won't want to talk to anyone.
that is when depression has begun.
i may sit in a corner all by myself
wondering if i'm living in hell.
i feel as if life has turned its back on me.
but in my heart thats not what i see.
i start to ignore the way i look
and the toll that its took.
then i take a good look in the mirror
'and what do i see'
everything that was told to me.
i see my face completly withdrawn
and the appearance that i formed.
i see all my loved ones that i've hurt
including the wife that's giving birth.
i realize then that i can not do it alone.
that i must seek the help that i need
to stop this inner bleed.
i fell down to my knees
and asked the LORD to hear my pleas
to give me the strength to do my best
and for him to do the rest.
as i got up from my short prayer
i heard a voice say in my ear.
'help yourself and i will help you'
thats all you have to do."

After consuming a bottle of Beam

She thinks of jumping into a pool
With a heavy brick tied to her neck
After she eats - she always throws up.
I know a girl who cuts herself, so her legs hurt
In the blood she finds relief
She doesn't know the other way
To help her deal with emotional pain
He thinks he is too ugly and will never change
So he's depressed
She thinks she is too fat
So she's depressed
She thinks that her parents don't love her
So she's depressed
Their solutions are worse than their problems...

Intertwined, amongst my veins
Self worth, self love
Are lost, within the pain
Anguish and shattered dreams
Lie embedded in my heart
A glimpse of personal torture
Revealed, within the art
A medicated mind
Does it offer resolution?
Candy coated prescriptions
Swallowed, without solution
Blind to the rising sun
Of opportunity, to thrive
Another breath inhaled
Without purpose, without drive
Shackled to depression
Consumed by failure, and disgrace
A crying soul unseen
I walk invisible, without face

Like a ten-ton truck.
One minute you are down
Then you are up.
With depression
there is no in-between.
You are in a dark tunnel
with no light to be seen.
You try to pull through
Try to cheer up.
You are sick of people
telling you:
'Enough is enough.'
It's energy-sapping
And you're always feeling rough.
When you're feeling worthless
friends and family you can't trust.
They are hanging around
Making a scene.
You know that they are worried -
still - you want them to leave.
Depression
is a very selfish
'State of Mind'.
But when you got Depression
no other 'State' can you find
When people say to you:
'It's time to cheer up.'
That is when it hits you
Like a ten-ton truck..."

Don't want to die

So I get out paper and pen
Once again depression sneaking in
I'm so lost within my soul
Pain from the past, trying to control
Darkness trying to steal my light
Trying to turn my day, into night
Got myself a brand new life
Need to bury the past, keep out the strife
My mind I struggle with from day to day
Please make the bad stuff, go away
They say that time heals all pain
Will my day come, or is it all in vain?
So once more I need to write
And maybe later, my day turn bright."

You don't feel upto facing anyone or anything
Depression is a huge emphasis on feeling sad and low
You feel like you're in a dark place with nowhere else to go
Depression is like you're falling deeper into a black hole
Your mind feels violated and as though you have no control
Depression is having little energy or lack of motivation
You feel tired and don't want to engage in conversation
Depression is used in the wrong context by naive people
They dont understand the seriousness of how it affects people

You will never understand it unless you've been through it before"

Bleed to nothingness in the night
Perhaps then my soul will fly
Unite with the wind and muggy air
Feel the warmth of joy's arms
So do what you want to my useless heart
Chop me to pieces or burn me alive
If death is my only way to salvation
Then I want to open the darkened door now."

my life has gone down the black hole of deep depression
my life has gone down to hell
so now i lie me, down to die
i have no reason to keep on suffering
my life is not worth living
i shall walk into the shadows and leave the sunshine deserted like me
you shall not find me amoung the others
for i shall be in the dark ally's of confused beings and far away
i shall join my fellow destroyed soul's
like the man whose feelings were swallowed by the dark black moon
this depression has caught me
like a cat with a bird in its claws of dispair
sometimes i feel like a disease is haunting me inside
i feel like a squashed soul-; shattered
happiness and joy gone forever
my life revolves around pain and sorrow
that's all i have to live by
my eyes are being deceived
the sun has disapeared
or did it never exist?
darkness summonds me out to do its will
never freeing these souls and i
soon i shall come out and seek revenge
on those who sent me down into depression
death so powerful
once you have it
you can't give it back
lost forever in an unknown universe

1584,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionPoembyBrianCounsell,"A period of crying can betray the soul
Showing the pain that makes us whole.
Without pain what would happiness be?
Would it be there for us to see.
Would we not know happiness
Without pain how could you tell what was best?
Is our pain in a way needed?
Is it somehow misleading?
Trying to show us, yet we get caught,
Too selfish to busy with my own thought.
But when you are happy think of the pain,
Oh think how good it is to be happy again."

I only frown
I have no smile left
Depression is a theft
I hate that I feel this way
I wish my feelings will go away
But I guess they're here to stay
I feel like I don't care
But I swear
That I can't bare
To be without feelings
And my heart isn't healing
Like it should
But I would
Do anything to take the pain away
I'd do it today
I wish I could talk about it
But my parent's would throw a fit
If they found out my reasons
It's just not the right season
To tell them how I feel
But I'll make you a deal
I'll tell you
If you believe it's true
Do you?
Good because you should
Now I could
Tell you all about it
But please don't throw a fit
It's because of my dad
He makes me so sad
And then he gets mad
At me for nothing
And I'd do anything
To make him proud of me
But he can't see
That I try too hard
I play the wrong card
Because he has no clue
That I'm sick with the depression flu
And my mom
Tries to play dumb
She says she'll love me no matter what
But she still treats me like a mut
I still have feelings
Even if my heart isn't healing
I can still feel the pain
That they're making me gain
I want you to accept me
But you can't see
That I am what I am
And you side with them
And you don't accept me
I just want to be me
And I want them to love me
I wanna make them proud of me!
*(A poem that tells so many secrets of mine, A poem where my parents wished they weren't mine, A poem that proves I'm not fine.) *"
1587,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionBluesPoembyDrPeterBouboulos,"There was a time not too long afar,
Where life was the norm;  mortgage, partner, dog and car.
The journey of life has no set plan,
It may seem to be traveling straight and narrow,
But against all wishes it may unexpectedly fan.
During this voyage we all aim to seek,
For many a person their vision is cloudy, and bleak.
When your life begins to deviate from this norm,
Your minds response is governed by an instinctive form.
To do or die, to fight or flight, if the mind is not of health,
There is no defense that can be bought by wealth.
The mind is powerful we all know,
In times of crisis it is its own foe.
When your head hits the pillow late at night,
All you crave is some respite.
Your thoughts won’t shut down to give you rest,
This will eventually delet your smile, to a frown at best.
When your thoughts are foggy amongst a cloud you can’t fathom,
You begin to spiral down this unwarranted chasm.
The fog is a black dog.
It roams freely and bites at will, without intervention and self preservation.
Its bite will inevitably kill.
The black dog is a clone of ones’ mind, open for all to see,
Allow it to roam and it will devour you, as it has to me.
One out of four, this dog will seek.
Its jaws are too powerful for the emotionally meek.
I have been bitten by this indiscriminant and unforgiving beast.
I thought I alone could conquer and resist its total debilitating feast.
I chose to ignore its prior warnings of desire.
My conscious mind made me a liar.
How naive I was, to reason,
That I alone could defeat my own minds’ treason.
We start to deflate in mood and aspiration,
Like an unloved child’s toy we end up in misery and condemnation.
The isolation is a factor that affects all bitten.
Yet we are told, we will improve, because, it is written.
To those who are bitten, and have become infected,
We succumb to dark desires, without being detected.
The black dog hides behind many masks,
This temporarily allows us to perform our daily tasks.
With the duration of time and self denial,
There comes a point where no mask can be retrieved, from an endless file.
Tired, weary and socially inept,
The ever tightening hold, will never ease, until you accept.
We all try to escape and ignore the realism of today, (whether through the use of masks, alcohol or drugs) ,
We all visibly start to self decay.
Ownership of the problem is the first step to take,
Discard these masks, they are an emotional fake.
See your doctor, search on the net,
Just ensure you are informatively well kept.
Seek a referral for specialist care,
The first meeting will seem daunting, but it will confront the dog, in an emotional dare.
The journey to improvement requires time and fare,
It hastens when we are amongst those, who truly show care.
A simple hug, a little smile,
Will work miracles to exhaust the internal fire.
Once all the masks are gone and you are finally self aware,
Always be true to your heart, and refute, any potential dare."
1588,Emotion,DepressionPoemsPantoumOfTheGreatDepressionPoembyDonaldJustice,"Our lives avoided tragedy
Simply by going on and on,
Without end and with little apparent meaning.
Oh, there were storms and small catastrophes.
Simply by going on and on
We managed. No need for the heroic.
Oh, there were storms and small catastrophes.
I don't remember all the particulars.
We managed. No need for the heroic.
There were the usual celebrations, the usual sorrows.
I don't remember all the particulars.
Across the fence, the neighbors were our chorus.
There were the usual celebrations, the usual sorrows
Thank god no one said anything in verse.
The neighbors were our only chorus,
And if we suffered we kept quiet about it.
At no time did anyone say anything in verse.
It was the ordinary pities and fears consumed us,
And if we suffered we kept quiet about it.
No audience would ever know our story.
It was the ordinary pities and fears consumed us.
We gathered on porches; the moon rose; we were poor.
What audience would ever know our story?
Beyond our windows shone the actual world.
We gathered on porches; the moon rose; we were poor.
And time went by, drawn by slow horses.
Somewhere beyond our windows shone the actual world.
The Great Depression had entered our souls like fog.
And time went by, drawn by slow horses.
We did not ourselves know what the end was.
The Great Depression had entered our souls like fog.
We had our flaws, perhaps a few private virtues.
But we did not ourselves know what the end was.
People like us simply go on.
We had our flaws, perhaps a few private virtues,
But it is by blind chance only that we escape tragedy.
And there is no plot in that; it is devoid of poetry.
Anonymous submission."

A poem of frustration, rage, bitterness, resentment, disappointment, envy, sadness, sickness, despair, depression, fear-
All feelings of down and darkness and shame and lust and emptiness
A poem of ugliness inside and anger which has no goodness in it
A poem to blame myself and the world
A poem of guilt and loneliness and nothingness and sadness again and again
A poem no one ever needs to feel
A bad poem on bad things
Ugly ugly ugly
As if even the earth were made in the image of darkness and death
Such a sad bad poem and such inner anger and sickness and sadness
What can it all mean?
When I am a person of such good intention
Who wants the best for us all?
What can it all mean
When God wants us to be better and better and good?
I don’t know.
I am just a little complaining discontent not yet at the end of my road perhaps.
God help me out of this again, please."
1590,Emotion,DepressionPoemsDepressionPoembyjessjayne,"Depression is when you hate everyone around
Depression is when you don't want to make a sound
Depression is when all you want to do is cry
Depression is when you feel like your dying inside
Depression is when you thoughts wonder all the time
Depression is when you can't sleep even though your tired
Depression is when you don't want to go on
Depression is when you can't stop shaking outside
Depression is when you hide who you are
Depression is when you put on a mask to hide what you feel
Depression is when you feel weak all the time
Depression is when you give in to everything around
Depression is when you don't care what happens anymore
Depression is just another day in my life

1591,Emotion,DepressionPoemsLonelinessAndDepressionPoembyRebekahJoh,"You have an empty feeling that comes from within
You long to share your feelings but no one will listen
You reach out for open arms, but nobody is there
Your tears fall to the ground, but nobody cares
You pick up the phone, but have no one to call
You feel overwhelmed; your mind is a crawl
You lay in your bed in the light of the moon
Just so you don't see those who aren't there for you
The flames spark inside you and heat up your fear
Your thoughts are suicidal, your days are so drear
Emotional fires burn up in your head
Fires of love and pain and regret
Consumed in your own darkness, you slowly fade away
Your once blue and sunny sky has turned to clouds of gray

1592,Emotion,DepressionPoemsBipolarDepressionPoembyMandyHoward,"Many ask, if I'm high,
Many ask, if I'm low,
Many ask, why are you so happy?
And many ask, why are you so sad?
Many questions asked, and I don't answer,
Many don't ask questions, and I'm left to question myself,
Many ask, what's wrong with you?
And many ask, what's wrong?
Many seem confused, but I don't care,
Many don't care, and now I'm confused.
Many wonder,
Many care,
Many laugh,
As I breathe for air.
Many know me, and I couldn't care less,
Many don't know me, and now I couldn't care more.
For those who don't know me,
I'm full of ups and downs,
Twists and turns,
Lefts and rights,
Many roller coaster rides.
My energy goes up and down,
My brain twists and turns,
My mood swings from left to right,
And then from right to left,
And then once more just a couple more times,
It's like a never-ending pendulum.
I think of life as an emotional roller coaster ride,
That has no beginning,
And has no middle,
And most of all has no ending.
Confused much?
I would think so...
But do you understand...
...What it's like to live with Bipolar Depression? ..."

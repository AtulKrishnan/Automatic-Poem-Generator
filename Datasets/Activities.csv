Through the rest of my years
Through the happiness
And the sorrows that bring tears
Dance with me
Consent to be my wife
And we’ll dance together
For the rest of our lives

1,Emotion,DancePoemsTheDancePoembyMelvinaGermain,"Andre fell in love with her beauty,
her royal elegant appearance.
She carried herself proud, purring
like a kitten, never boisterous or loud.
Stroking her perfect body, touching
her curves oh so gently.
He felt like the king of the ball, stood
handsome and so very tall.
Together they made their royal entrance,
totally captivating the audience.
Proud as can be,
they danced- for all to see.
Screams of elation filled the crowd,
while this royal couple took their bows.
A dance performed with perfection,
no need for criticism or direction.
An applaud broke out, a standing ovation.
Smiles laughter an awesome celebration.
The competition ended in glory,
now on with that fairy tale story."
2,Emotion,DancePoemsVisionsOfTerroristsDanceInMyHeadPoembyBEAUGOLDEN,"We are Americans went nuke in 41
We are Americans we have the biggest gun
We now fight a war of attrition
We underestimate all our competition
We fight to maintain our hegemonious crime
We really don't care if we get there in time
We build a new weapon that kills before threat
We send in a soldier who isn't dead yet
We send in a soldier who comes back to life
We send home an alien to impregnate his wife
Visions of Terrorists soon walking our streets
Visions of Terrorists soon buying our meats
Visions of Terrorists dance in my head
Clinton and Rushdie will leave us for dead
Visions of Terrorists torture my brain
America, the collective, is going insane

3,Emotion,DancePoemsDanceWithMeInTheKeyOfLifePoembyGeorgeJeroneBrotherDeBuffJefferson,"Holding the strings of vibes
We move to dance of life
When I look I see your essence
In space now empty
Quiet where the shout of whisper
Voice unheard in heart beats
Come here and dance
Hear the song of my mind
Dance to my beat in life
Let me hold you close to me
I feel my song is you
I want to sing you play to you
My beautiful song you be
Let me turn you
In step with my life
Move with me to music of life
Dance to pain of life
To joy of reality
The song for us to dance
Your moans of pleasure
Move me to love you
I now want to dance with you
Our finger touch our lip meet
Kissing to beats of jazz before
The blue come down on my soul
On I am coming to be true
To need what you be for me
Let just dance to our song
What the matter I’m the same as
Before your beats is my beat
Come dance with me come need me
I wait for you to know
I am for you only
Dance come dance your story with me
Move to life up and down
Dance with me I need you to dance
The dance of life in song of love"

One Two Three Four
Forwards. Sideways.
Sideways. Back...
Victor Sylvester, Victor Sylvester,
I thought of you yester-
day, white tie and tails,
trousers as tight
as a ball without a ballroom,
Cuban Romeo moustache and
patent leather hair...
drumming out strict tempo
the tempo of our lives
learning to dance girlfriends
into bed or into wives...
do they still teach ballroom
to your hissing records,
down in Cheam or Purley,
head up, shiny shoes,
pressed tight, breast to breast,
adolescents wondering
if a jockstrap would be best?
now it's coming back, I see,
One Two One Two
swing her round and pronto,
but watch, don't dropp her onto
that shiny shellacked floor...
Ou sont les disques d'antan, je me demande?
....gone and played, the yesteryears..
our sweaty-sweet Sylvester years..
one two, one two,
our memory's locked embrace..."
5,Emotion,DancePoemsIWantToDancePoembyRachelBeu,"How does it feel to be?
On the floor with all eyes on you?
To move so swiftly and gracefully
To be loved
What is it like to dance?
What is it like to feel your partner?
And when do you start
Before the song ends and all you’ve
Hoped for comes to a halt
And time seems to stand still
Leaving you lost
Standing alone with your partner still in motion
How does it feel to be in love?
How does it feel to cry of a broken heart?
How does it feel to know stop from start?
What is it like to dance?
I want to know
I want to feel
I want to be able to cry
I want to love
I want to move
I want to sing like you
I want to breathe
Can you give me one last chance?
Can you teach me?
Can I learn?
That is what I want
That is what I need
Help me to Dance"
6,Emotion,DancePoemsAnOrchardDancePoembyNormanRowlandGale,"All work is over at the farm
And men and maids are ripe for glee;
Love slips among them sly and warm
Or calls them to the chestnut-tree.
As Colin looks askance at Jane
He draws his hand across his mouth;
She understands the rustic pain,
And something of the tender south
About her milkmaid beauty flits.
Her dress of lilac print for guide
Draws shepherd Colin where she sits,
Who, faring to her lovely side
To snatch his evening pension tries,
But skimming like a bird from clutch
The maid escapes his Cupid touch,
And speeding down a passage flies
Not fast enough to cheat his eyes.
Ah, sweet-lip ways and sweet-lip days,
And sweetheart captures of the waist,
How swiftly still the virgin runs
She's sure at last to be embraced!
Now Colin fires at kiss delayed,
And faster flits the red stone floor
Till Fortune yields the tricky maid
A captive at the pantry door!
The farmer with his fifty years
Is not too old to join the fun;
He pulls the milkmaids' pinky ears
And bids a likely stripling run
To find the fiddlers for a dance:
And in the cherry orchard there
A tune shall mingle with romance,
And love be brave in open air.
The village wakens to the bliss,
The crones and gaffers crawl to see
The country game of step and kiss
Beneath the laden cherry-tree.
The chairs and benches now are set,
Old John is wheedled from his pet,
The cider cup with beady eyes
Responds to winkings of the skies.
The farmer, burly in his chair,
Now claps for ev'ry fond and fair
To foot it on the grassy patch
While rustic violinists snatch
From out those varnished birds of wood
A tune to jink it in the blood.
Now Jane and Colin in a trice
Float sweetly round not less than thrice
Before their motion draws a pair
To revel with the dancing air.
The thrush, that on his velvet wipes
His juicy bill, protesting pipes,
And, somewhat as a piccolo,
Doth race the concord of the bow.
A virgin yonder by the tree
Rejects a mate who saucily
Would press, if she might only start,
Her modest homespun to his heart.
Ah, sweet-lip ways and sweet-lip days,
And sweetheart captures of the waist,
Though like a finch the maiden flies
She's sure at last to be embraced.
The orchard now is in full bloom
With rosy cheek and snowdrop throat;
The stars invade the growing gloom,
And rarelier sounds the blackbird's note.
But in this dewy little park
Love burns the brighter for the dark,
And till he use a stricter rule
Dear Cicely's cheek shall never cool!
The fiddlers storm a tomboy tune,
The shepherds closer clasp the girls
While skirts the more desert the shoon,
And rebel leap the loely curls.
The farmer glows within his chair
And muses on the dancing time
When he and she--a matchless pair--
Were warm and nimble in their prime.
God bless the man who, duller grown,
Can feel the younger heaven anew
By granting to his maids and men
A romp by starlight in the dew!
Ah, greenwood ways and greenwood days,
And soft pursuings of the waist,
The cheek must yellow out of praise,
And bent be those who once embraced!
And now they pant against the trees,
And, using darkness for their plan,
Girls loose the garters at their knees
And mend the clumsiness of man.
One virgin, thankful for the dance,
About the music shyly trips--
Her Love's a fiddler, and her love
Pops fruit in Paganini's lips;
Or finding on the starlit tree
The wife and husband cherry there,
She hangs the couple at his cheek
And hides the stalk with tufts of hair.
The girls are at the cider-cup,
And shepherds tilt the yellow base
Until a giddy amber flood
Runs, kissing, over Cicely's face,
And Dora's upper lip doth shine
With winking beads of apple-wine.
The fiddlers scrape a farewell tune,
The dancers dwindle in the dusk
While summer puffs of easy wind
Bring hints of cottage garden musk.
And thus the revel dearly ends
With milkmaid's palm in shepherd's hand,
And lovers grow from only friends
Where plum and pear and apple stand.
Ah, sweet-lip ways and sweet-lip days,
And sweetheart captures of the waist,
How fast so-e'er the virgin flies
She's sure at last to be embraced!"
7,Emotion,DancePoemsGhostDancePoembyRayLucero,"Long ago a prophet appeared,
A Piute Medicine Chief known as Wovoka.
He spoke to the Lakota people and others,
Of how to banish the white man.
They knew not they faced such great numbers.
This Messiah taught the Ghost Dance,
And promised come next spring,
New soil would smother all white men,
Sweet grass would cover the land,
Wild horses & buffalo would return,
All who danced the Ghost Dance,
Would be taken up into the air,
Suspended while new earth was laid down.
Kicking Bear assured Sitting Bull that,
If their people wore Ghost Dance shirts,
White mans bullets could not strike them so,
They painted their shirts with sacred symbols.
Indian agents grew nervous, moved quickly,
Telegraphing Washington for more troops.
Soldiers surrounded Sitting Bulls camp,
A fight ensued and many were killed.
Ghost Dance was thwarted,
before magic could fulfill...
'The Second Coming” prophecy belonged to the white man,
For they worshiped 'A Most Jealous god”"
8,Emotion,DancePoemsFirstDancePoembyNehaDua,"Like an infant in the cradle
I rocked in his arms and penned this fable
The sweet lucid lyrics of the song
Made me forget right and wrong
He looked at me as if a rainbow in the sky
My heart skipped a beat and I felt so shy
My silky black hair acted as a veil
But his one touch and I let myself sail
He held me close and his lips touched mine
As if a thirsty soul tasted french wine
My fingers then reached his curly hair
Ang got entwined without care
I envisioned our future in those moments so pure
He is my soulmate my heart said for sure
The time should stand still was my wish
I know I was acting childish
One last embrace and that will be all
For I have to rush back before my dad's call
Mesmerized by the thought of that beautiful evening
I am writing this while his intoxicatins smell still lingering.."

10,Emotion,DancePoemsDanceDanceAndDancePoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"Dance, dance and dance
Dance at once
If you get chance
To celebrate joy
With intention to enjoy
Keep cool
Even if someone calls you fool
Keeps you on target
And tries to seal your fate
Loose no patience
And keep silence
With no reaction
For alter action
I am not worried
And carried
By simple accusation
That spoils good relation
Be in joyous mood
With nutritious food
That may be simple
But rich in contents for individual"

12,Emotion,DancePoemsDanceAMultiColouredDanceOfRainbowPoembyChrisGVaillancourt,"Words can fail like magnets not sticking to the fridge
and we all complain when the rent is due again.
Pay your bills and meet the obligations of
the world, never mind attending to the
payment of your soul.
The new voice is speaking, the new religion
has been announced. We are to celebrate
everything and tradition we are to renounce.
Dance a multi-coloured dance of rainbow
prisms and inter-faith delusions.
We are to ignore the truth of the Gospel
for too many find that it offends.  We must
not have complaining and so we must merge
into one blend. Let the fires burn so
brightly as we burn away the words
we do not like. Dance a multi-coloured
dance of rainbow prisms and
inter-faith delusions.
Men should not sleep with women, for
that is not the way the new voices want
it to be. Instead they should seek male
partners and live in illusions of
conformity. We must not call a spade
a spade for in doing so we ignore
the new mindset.
Dance a multi-coloured dance of rainbow
prisms and inter-faith delusions.
No need to wave flags for we must
not cause nationalism to exist. Only
one nation is right and that is the
propaganda we must believe. So we
watch our televsions and rejoice
in the latest American war.
Dance a multi-coloured dance of rainbow
prisms and inter-faith delusions.
The parade has begun, and the marchers
have lined up like soliders in a drill.
The banners are ready ot wave, the
sound of music will soon flood the
streets. We will march for equality
and conform ourselves to a plastic
sheeted state of being.  Dance a
multi-coloured dance of rainbow
prisms and inter-faith delusions.
And though the old ways will not die,
we will pretend they do not matter.
We will surrender ourselves to
immoral methods of existing. We
will speak only of politically correct
topics and we shall never disagree.
Dance a multi-coloured dance of rainbow
prisms and inter-faith delusions."
13,Emotion,DancePoemsFivePoemsToPonderInvitationToTheDancePoembyMargaretAlice,"1. My Criterion For Success
You say you find merit in a theory that is based
on a meaningless universe, created by chaos -
quite by chance, inadvertently spawning life,
then intelligence; now that life is self-aware and
clever enough to study itself and realise it is
caught in a meaninglessness in a random universe
that will be destroyed one day, all life will become
extinct - leaving no trace of its passing in a material
universe – pray tell, what merit did you find? It
sounds like living hell… Is this theory the reason
for your defeatist attitude, calling the world bad,
society at large is going to pieces and life is not
worthwhile – and where’s the merit in that?
Why is it meritorious to think life horrible, to be
destroyed one day, having flickered just for a
short while in eternity? Is that why you wear
negativity like a black mantle around you? You
won’t take any chances, you say, you fear
taking risks, you made your philosophical bed
long ago – and now mean to sleep on it –
come what may – where’s the merit in that?
I prefer to know that all we think is based on
assumptions that one day will be overthrown,
therefore I choose the best theories and make
hope my own, I trust in tomorrow and expect
non-physical life after death, and should it not
happen, can’t cause me sorrow; I will have
had the happiest life that could be – and
that is my criterion for success!
2. I Will Try To
I did not expect to see a second-hand book-
shop in the latest new centre of shops but
suddenly – what should I see;
“The Atlantis Blueprint” A book written by
Rand Flem-Ath and Colin Wilson – the very
same subject I had settled upon as one for
my December Holiday – it gives me goose-
bumps – did the gods listen to my request –
they must have, to answer so literally.
I shall rewrite or summarise in long-hand all
holiday-long; I’m overjoyed, singing a song;
I’m so happy, you forgave me for being
obnoxious all week-end; I can dream my own
dreams, I have been given a second chance
to try and improve, and I will try to!
3. Karl Maria von Weber – Invitation to the Dance
And I couldn’t withstand it, the invitation to the
dance, I had to join in, dancing in my baggy pants
and I became the different characters, called
forth by every change of phrase, the pretty ladies
with wide dresses, the men with scabbards dancing
in a row, the flowers twirling slowly, the fairies
dancing in a circle, it was an operetta, I realised,
presented by young children - all dressed up and
dancing with their props, all was twirling, whirling,
then the short, strong movements of the “men”
advancing in aggression, the ladies with their elegant
strides, all turning circles, gliding round the stage –
then the stage became the kitchen, and I was back
again, happier than before, sure life must hold
some deeper meaning which I would find someday…
4. To A Special Friend
Thank you for listening
to me when the vastness
of space is spinning
such a fastness –
spinning in my head;
when I’m balanced
on a tightrope between
grey realities and colourful
eternities, living the
bubbles of fantasy;
your gaze steadies
my tread, helps me
to slow down, to stop
the kaleidoscope moving
in my Head,
to pull out a picture and
describe the view to you,
afford me a chance to see
the sights I always miss in
my fast flight between images…
5. A God On Earth…
I have always looked up to my big brother
to me he has always been a god on earth,
not grown-up, yet capable of doing everything
long before I could master it - he was
Different from everybody else – when he
consented to play with us, the younger ones,
the sun came out, the world felt safe, all
was right, and it happened so few times
My brother is more talented than others
and I’m scared of him, he knows my weak
points, my juvenile sins, he sees me within
a cloud of childhood sorrows and guilt
And I still see him as a god on earth..."

15,Emotion,DancePoemsWillYouDanceWithMeAgainPoembyPdishere,"Will you dance with me again?
Like we danced beneath the stars
Swaying in each others arms
To the music of a thousand guitars.
Will you dance with me again?
Like we danced the first time around
When breaths mingled and cheeks caressed
And all we heard was the heartbeat loud.
Will you dance with me again?
Like we did when we kissed
Gently first, and then with passion
When two lives got woven into one.
Will you dance with me again?
Just this one last time
For I want to feel loved
Before the end of lifetime!

16,Emotion,DancePoemsDreamersDancePoembyGeoffWarden,"I have been touched
By Loves hand
If but one moment in time
And it's feeling
Wheat fields harvest
Can not compare in value or worth
I have felt inside
It's mystical spell
And it's dance upon a thin line so fair
If but for a moment
one small stitch of time
Two souls reached the promise of the rainbow
'Twas late August eve
Beneath full moon sky
She placed her heart in my soulful hand
To this very day
Somewhere deep within
The magic has home to which it resides
That one dreamers dance
We did share long ago
Now holds my heart never letting go"

19,Emotion,DancePoemsDanceDanceDanceTilYouCanDanceNoMorePoembyTomJMariani,"As I drove 'cross town today
To get my Holiday shopping under way
With my car radio tuned in
Classic Rock - - let the dance begin
On comes a Don Henley from 1985
- -'All She Wants to Do Is Dance'- -
Up comes the volume
Down comes all four car windows
Take that you hip-hoppers
Wish I had my old speakers
From my '66 Malibu
Then the lyrics struck me
Maybe I've been watchin'
Too many presidental debates
Maybe just too much CNN
Twenty-four hours a day
I have no idea if this is what
Henley was trying to say
But given the state of America's
Foreign and energy policies
Our refusal to sign
The Kyoto Protocol
Ratified by 170 other countries
To reduce greehouse gases
And our nonplused reaction to that
And the six-year Iraq War
THE IRAQ WAR - -? ? ?
It's our war
Bought and
Paid for
Its cost to date in U.S. dollars
If relevant to you $469,509,480,910
U.S. troups dead
A very relevant 3,865
I said  I'm no sure who Henley
Had on his mind
When he wrote and sang
'All she wants to do is dance'
All I could see in my minds eye
As I drove on
Was my Uncle Sam in a dress
Dancing and wantin' to party
Thats' what Don's song was saying to me
War's in a Surge mode
Demos first 100 days
Are long gone
'And all she wants to do is dance
Rebels being rebels
Since I don't know when
And all she wants to do is dance
Molotov cocktails the local drink
They make 'em up right
In the kitchen sink
Carzy people walkin' 'round with blood in their eyes
And all she wants to do
is dance, dance, dance'
We're busy getting ready
To dance through the Holidays
Macy's and Wall Mart
Already playing Siren's song
And all we want to do is dance
'Never mind the heat
Comin' off the street'
All we want to do is dance
And make romance
We want to party
How did Don know
He'd make me pull over
Park my car and listen
To his refrian
And suddenly
Not feel like dancing

20,Emotion,DancePoems2003TheFirstDancePoembyDeanaRode,"You walk up to me
those blue oceans of yours twinkling
as you take my hand
and lead me towards the crowded room...
As your arm goes around me I smile
while we begin to drift away
into our own little fantasy world
that only the two of us can occupy...
You slowly move in closer
until you're inches away from my eyes
the essence of you going through me
as you softly speak into my mind...
The music has ended now
back to reality we stand
looking at each other with a new light
wondering what will happen the next time we dance..."

Where then shall you go?
When your life on earth is done
What happens to your soul?
You can take a gamble
And live like there’s no God
And later have to scramble
For you’ve played against the odds
Why go and do the devil’s dance
When the victory’s been won
Why leave eternity to chance
Believe in the Father’s Son"

Perhaps I will throw you my heart.

Lower the baskets, dancing,

Falls from the sky,
I gaze in wonder,
As the white flakes fly.
Dancing and swirling,
Through the air,
Like an aerial ballerina,
Without a care.
It lands on the leaves,
On the trees and the grass,
It is silently pretty,
But I know it won’t last.
But just for the moment,
I am taken away,
By the still quiet beauty,
That is here for the day.

Remembering
Old school
Mates,
With whom
I had spent
So much time
But who never
Really knew me
The old neighborhoods,
That taught me
To sail away on
Skate boards
While holding on
To billowing
White sheets
As
Those summer storms
Approached
And
How to fly away
On
The highest kite
Or
To design
Private worlds
Reading
Robinson Crusoe

Much beloved
Who sometimes
Wore her sunglasses
In the dark
A generous grandmother
Who always
Saw my needs

Second calls

Hopes …his were
So sadly
Left over

Of how they

27,Emotion,DancePoemsButInTheWinePressesTheHumanGrapesSingNotNorDancePoembyWilliamBlake,"But in the Wine-presses the human grapes sing not nor dance:
They howl and writhe in shoals of torment, in fierce flames consuming,
In chains of iron and in dungeons circled with ceaseless fires,
In pits and dens and shades of death, in shapes of torment and woe:
The plates and screws and racks and saws and cords and fires and cisterns
The cruel joys of Luvah's Daughters, lacerating with knives
And whips their victims, and the deadly sport of Luvah's Sons.
They dance around the dying and they drink the howl and groan,
They catch the shrieks in cups of gold, they hand them to one another:
These are the sports of love, and these the sweet delights of amorous play,
Tears of the grape, the death sweat of the cluster, the last sigh
Of the mild youth who listens to the luring songs of Luvah.----"

Without music, without obliged to any defined rhythm, I am inching towards it, towards my coffin. Throughout my dancing once again I am watching everything...
I am dancing without music
Dancing without definite steps
Without a rhythm and melody
Dancing towards the coffin
Daylight creeping away streets
Through the deserted ferries
Windless deserts and silence
I am dancing without music
Through colorless dreams
Through unspoken whispers
Through cemeteries
I am dancing without music
I am dancing without music
Dancing without definite steps
without a rhythm and melody
Dancing towards the coffin
Without wearing glass shoes
Without a stockings
Without feeling bleeding feet
I am dancing without music
Through burned gardens
Through spring never visited valleys
Through silence filled emptiness
I am dancing without music
I am dancing without music
Dancing without definite steps
Without a rhythm and melody
Dancing towards the coffin"
31,Emotion,DancePoemsTheBabysDancePoembyAnnTaylor,"Dance little baby, dance up high,
Never mind baby, mother is by;
Crow and caper, caper and crow,
There little baby, there you go;
Up to the ceiling, down to the ground,
Backwards and forwards, round and round;
Dance little baby, and mother shall sing,
With the merry coral, ding, ding, ding."
32,Emotion,DancePoemsFreedomsDancePoembyJessicaMillsaps,"As in the desert,
A sand blows,
It's eastward wings carrying it's wonderous jewels
A lady, dancing no less, her face that of a thousand queens,
Drawing all those about into her deep cavern of mystery,
Her fiery presence both a blessing and a curse,
For there before you now stands the dancer of life.
No lines shall be cut, No rules shall be decided
A wind shall shape the gentle curves,
And water shall give it's shine
As the fire within glows brightly, herself a lady of time
Swords flash in the setting sun,
And veils twirl around her,
A commotion caused over her openess, her trueness
A woman, a woman, not to be free
Not to be opened, not to be seen
No, No, this is not how to be!
She shall not hidden, nor given as a bride
But open her soul, and hold out her pride
There is a dance, a dance to be free
I speak of this dance,
Because between you and me,
It's the dance of the ancients, and the dance of the new
Of the old and the young,
It's the dance of many a tongue,
For this is my dance, my chance to be free
And open and happy, and truely be me"

34,Emotion,DancePoemsTheDanceOfDeathPoembyJohannWolfgangvonGoethe,"THE warder looks down at the mid hour of night,
On the tombs that lie scatter'd below:
The moon fills the place with her silvery light,
And the churchyard like day seems to glow.
When see! first one grave, then another opes wide,
And women and men stepping forth are descried,
In cerements snow-white and trailing.
In haste for the sport soon their ankles they twitch,
And whirl round in dances so gay;
The young and the old, and the poor, and the rich,
But the cerements stand in their way;
And as modesty cannot avail them aught here,
They shake themselves all, and the shrouds soon appear
Scatter'd over the tombs in confusion.
Now waggles the leg, and now wriggles the thigh,
As the troop with strange gestures advance,
And a rattle and clatter anon rises high,
As of one beating time to the dance.
The sight to the warder seems wondrously queer,
When the villainous Tempter speaks thus in his ear:
""Seize one of the shrouds that lie yonder!""
Quick as thought it was done! and for safety he fled
Behind the church-door with all speed;
The moon still continues her clear light to shed
On the dance that they fearfully lead.
But the dancers at length disappear one by one,
And their shrouds, ere they vanish, they carefully don,
And under the turf all is quiet.
But one of them stumbles and shuffles there still,
And gropes at the graves in despair;
Yet 'tis by no comrade he's treated so ill
The shroud he soon scents in the air.
So he rattles the door--for the warder 'tis well
That 'tis bless'd, and so able the foe to repel,
All cover'd with crosses in metal.
The shroud he must have, and no rest will allow,
There remains for reflection no time;
On the ornaments Gothic the wight seizes now,
And from point on to point hastes to climb.
Alas for the warder! his doom is decreed!
Like a long-legged spider, with ne'er-changing speed,
Advances the dreaded pursuer.
The warder he quakes, and the warder turns pale,
The shroud to restore fain had sought;
When the end,--now can nothing to save him avail,--
In a tooth formed of iron is caught.
With vanishing lustre the moon's race is run,
When the bell thunders loudly a powerful One,
And the skeleton fails, crush'd to atoms."
35,Emotion,DancePoemsTheDawnDancePoembyClarenceMichaelJamesStanislausDennis,"What do you think I saw to-day when I arose at dawn?
Blue Wrens and Yellow-tails dancing on the lawn!
Bobbing here, and bowing there, gossiping away,
And how I wished that you were there to see the merry play!
But you were snug abed, my boy, blankets to your chin,
Nor dreamed of dancing birds without or sunbeams dancing in.
Grey Thrush, he piped the tune for them. I peeped out through the glass
Between the window curtains, and I saw them on the grass -
Merry little fairy folk, dancing up and down,
Blue bonnet, yellow skirt, cloaks of grey and brown,
Underneath the wattle-tree, silver in the dawn,
Blue Wrens and Yellow-tails dancing on the lawn."
36,Emotion,DancePoemsDoYouWannaDancePoembyTheodoraTheoOnken,"Can you feel it?  Can you sense it?
You know the rhythm
Sinking into your Dancing Feet?
Spiriting you up on the dance floor 'of life'
Moving your entire body, to the living beat -
Can you hear those Rocking Drums Beating?
And the Electric from Jimi's guitar?
Isn't it, simply amazing -
Middle-aged-and here we are, dancin' stars?
It's in our bodies and our souls -
From our Analytical Heads to our Movin' Feet
Its the 'Music of our Lifetime'
As we pass our days, to its beat -
Perhaps, to that of a different drummer -
But that is, what makes each of us, unique -
The Music, it spirits each of our lives along -
Dance, dance, dancing, are Our Musical Feet!

37,Emotion,DancePoemsTheDancePoembyHenryLivingstonJr,"Take the name of the swain, a forlorn witless elf
Who was chang'd to a flow'r for admiring himself.
A part deem'd essential in each lady's dress
With what maidens cry when they wish to say yes.
A lullabye carriage, soft, cozy and light
With the name of the Poet who sang on the night.
The queen of Cairo, all lovely and winning
Whose blandishments ever kept Antony grinning.
The flow'r whose odors unremittingly please:
With the glory of forests, the king of the trees.
To the prince of the fairies, a jealous old knave,
Put the name of the tree that undid Mother Eve.
To finish the whole, add that period of day
When the linnet and thrush to repose hie away.
The initials of these, if adjusted with care.
Will show you the fairest where thousands are fair.
The sweet, pretty graces still hover about her
And Cupid would die with vexation without her.
When she swims in the dance or wherever she goes
She's crowded by witlings, plain-fellows, and beaux
Who throng at her elbow and tread on her toes.
If a pin or a hankerchief happen to fall
To seize on the prise fills with uproar the ball;
Such pulling and hawling & shoving & pushing
As rivals the racket of 'key and the cushion; '
And happy- thrice happy! too happy! the swain
Who can replace the pin or bandana again.
Tho the fellows surround & so humbly adore her
The girls on the contrary cannot endure her;
Her beauty their beauty forever disgraces
And her sweeter face still eclipses their faces-
For no lov'ly girl can a lov'ly girl bear
And fair ones are ever at war with the fair.

38,Emotion,DancePoemsADancePoembyJolantaGradowicz,"Could I ask you to dance, madam?
Let’s go to dance to this music.
You mustn’t be a lonely woman
When everything is so rhythmic.
Why do you lower your eyes?
Why do you blush and tremble?
I see disbelief on your face...
Your touch is timid and gentle.
I feel your heart beat like a bell.
You speed up though music is slow.
What happened, my dear dancer?
Is there a trouble or sorrow?
I ask you, but you keep silent.
I give a tighter hug to you.
What a dance! I love this movement.
I dream it will begin anew…"

40,Emotion,DancePoemsAutumnDancePoembyShalaDrake,"Autumn.
Fall.
Leaves drop. Cranberry, gold, chocolate, and rust.
Twitter and giggle as the wind blows them about.
Black birds glide through the air with a graceful ebb and flow.
Breathing in and out.
Confused, perhaps, on which way to fly.
The weather, sweet Mother, taunting us with warm days and cold nights.
Swift breezes.
Sweet hot cocoa kisses.
Gleam in the eye's of babes, tossing leaves up and out of their grasp. Only to watch them glide back down to the starting position.
Hot teas, warm soups, crusty breads, melted butter.
Shawls wrapped around chilly shoulders.
Warm arms nestling you into love.
Snuggling under blankets.
This is the season to Fall.
Fall into dreams, kisses, love, and joy.
Hibernation begins.
The season of hearty living, warm embraces and joyful awareness in ones own self.
Welcome Autumn.
Welcome to the Fall of life.
A time when maturity has reached it's peak and spirals back down to rest before beginning again.
The Spiral dance has begun.
We decline, to ascend.
We bow down, to rise again.
We ebb and flow to the rhythm of life.
Inhale and exhale.
We all dance to this beat.
We dance with quiet feet.
Welcome, Welcome, I welcome you with warmth and gratefulness.
Come, and begin the dance with us.
We have been waiting."

42,Emotion,DancePoemsTheMasterOfTheDancePoembyVachelLindsay,"A chant to which it is intended a group of children shall dance and improvise pantomime led by their dancing-teacher.
A master deep-eyed
Ere his manhood was ripe,
He sang like a thrush,
He could play any pipe.
So dull in the school
That he scarcely could spell,
He read but a bit,
And he figured not well.
A bare-footed fool,
Shod only with grace;
Long hair streaming down
Round a wind-hardened face;
He smiled like a girl,
Or like clear winter skies,
A virginal light
Making stars of his eyes.
In swiftness and poise,
A proud child of the deer,
A white fawn he was,
Yet a fwn without fear.
No youth thought him vain,
Or made mock of his hair,
Or laughed when his ways
Were most curiously fair.
A mastiff at fight,
He could strike to the earth
The envious one
Who would challenge his worth.
However we bowed
To the schoolmaster mild,
Our spirits went out
To the fawn-looted child.
His beckoning led
Our troop to the brush.
We found nothing there
But a wind and a hush.
He sat by a stone
And he looked on the ground,
As if in the weeds
There was something profound.
His pipe seemed to neigh,
Then to bleat like a sheep,
Then sound like a stream
Or a waterfall deep.
It whispered strange tales,
Human words it spoke not.
Told fair things to come,
And our marvellous lot
If now with fawn-steps
Unshod we advanced
To the midst of the grove
And in reverence danced.
We obeyed as he piped
Soft grass to young feet,
Was a medicine mighty,
A remedy meet.
Our thin blood awoke,
It grew dizzy and wild,
Though scarcely a word
Moved the lips of a child.
Our dance gave allegiance,
It set us apart,
We tripped a strange measure,
Uplifted of heart.
II
We thought to be proud
Of our fawn everywhere.
We could hardly see how
Simple books were a care.
No rule of the school
This strange student could tame.
He was banished one day,
While we quivered with shame.
He piped back our love
On a moon-silvered night,
Enticed us once more
To the place of delight.
A greeting he sang
And it made our blood beat,
It tramped upon custom
And mocked at defeat.
He builded a fire
And we tripped in a ring,
The embers our books
And the fawn our good king.
And now we approached
All the mysteries rare
That shadowed his eyelids
And blew through his hair.
That spell now was peace
The deep strength of the trees,
The children of nature
We clambered her knees.
Our breath and our moods
Were in tune with her own,
Tremendous her presence,
Eternal her throne.
The ostracized child
Our white foreheads kissed,
Our bodies and souls
Became lighter than mist.
Sweet dresses like snow
Our small lady-loves wore,
Like moonlight the thoughts
That our bosoms upbore.
Like a lily the touch
Of each cold little hand.
The loves of the stars
We could now understand.
O quivering air!
O the crystalline night!
O pauses of awe
And the faces swan-white!
O ferns in the dusk!
O forest-shrined hour!
O earth that sent upward
The thrill and the power,
To lift us like leaves,
A delirious whirl,
The masterful boy
And the delicate girl!
What child that strange night-time
Can ever forget?
His fealty due
And his infinite debt
To the folly divine,
To the exquisite rule
Of the perilous master,
The fawn-looted fool?
III
Now soldiers we seem,
And night brings a new thing,
A terrible ire,
As of thunder awing.
A warrior power,
That old chivalry stirred,
When knights took up arms,
As the maidens gave word.
THE END OF OUR WAR,
WILL BE GLORY UNTOLD.
WHEN THE TOWN LIKE A GREAT
BUDDING ROSE SHALL UNFOLD!
Near, nearer that war,
And that ecstasy comes,
We hear the trees beating
Invisible drums.
The fields of the night
Are starlit above,
Our girls are white torches
Of conquest and love.
No nerve without will,
And no breast without breath,
We whirl with the planets
That never know death!"
43,Emotion,DancePoemsTheDancePoembyFriedrichSchiller,"See how, like lightest waves at play, the airy dancers fleet;
And scarcely feels the floor the wings of those harmonious feet.
Ob, are they flying shadows from their native forms set free?
Or phantoms in the fairy ring that summer moonbeams see?
As, by the gentle zephyr blown, some light mist flees in air,
As skiffs that skim adown the tide, when silver waves are fair,
So sports the docile footstep to the heave of that sweet measure,
As music wafts the form aloft at its melodious pleasure,
Now breaking through the woven chain of the entangled dance,
From where the ranks the thickest press, a bolder pair advance,
The path they leave behind them lost--wide open the path beyond,
The way unfolds or closes up as by a magic wand.
See now, they vanish from the gaze in wild confusion blended;
All, in sweet chaos whirled again, that gentle world is ended!
No!--disentangled glides the knot, the gay disorder ranges--
The only system ruling here, a grace that ever changes.
For ay destroyed--for ay renewed, whirls on that fair creation;
And yet one peaceful law can still pervade in each mutation.
And what can to the reeling maze breathe harmony and vigor,
And give an order and repose to every gliding figure?
That each a ruler to himself doth but himself obey,
Yet through the hurrying course still keeps his own appointed way.
What, would'st thou know?  It is in truth the mighty power of tune,
A power that every step obeys, as tides obey the moon;
That threadeth with a golden clue the intricate employment,
Curbs bounding strength to tranquil grace, and tames the wild enjoyment.
And comes the world's wide harmony in vain upon thine ears?
The stream of music borne aloft from yonder choral spheres?
And feel'st thou not the measure which eternal Nature keeps?
The whirling dance forever held in yonder azure deeps?
The suns that wheel in varying maze?--That music thou discernest?
No! Thou canst honor that in sport which thou forgettest in earnest."
44,Emotion,DancePoemsEverybodyDanceTheDanceOfTheDeadPoembyCharlieFKane,"As the sun sinks upon the horizon,
As the dark night creeps in,
The dead dance.
On the streets they roam,
Silent,
Alone.
Everybody dances,
The saints and the sinners,
Everybody dances,
To the sound of the rhythm,
Everybody dances,
The dance of the dead.
The dance of the dead goes on,
And on,
Never stops,
Never slows,
Time does not matter to the dead.
Everybody dances,
The poor and the rich,
Everybody dances,
To the cries to the babies,
Everybody dances,
The dance of the dead.
As your time goes up,
The dead dance into your room,
Filled with silent movements,
They twirl with grace,
And style
And ease.
They reach out their hands,
And you take it,
And join the dance of the dead.
Everybody dance,
The young and the old,
Everybody dance,
The music is playing,
Everybody dance,
To the dance of the dead.
C’mon,
Everybody dance,
Soldiers and lovers,
Oh,
Everybody dance,
To sound they cry,
So,
Everybody dance,
To the dance of the dead,
The dance of the dead.
Oh,
Everybody dances,
Because the dance never stops.

...but there was a black cat,
who sat down beside me
and told me that -
'This cat has strong legs, and the love of thrills'
'I like to climb things - including hills'
The story smelled fishy, not what it seemed
Truth better than fiction, who would have dreamed?
'A lovely wee cat, a lovely wee kitty
so kind and so playful, but most of all pretty'
Have you ever seen a cat that could dance?
to writhe and wrigge, wiggle and prance?
What a sight to see, for you or for me
my eyes became locked and wouldn't come free.
But that was the plan, from start until end
to hook me with dance to make me a friend.
This cat was not mean, this cat was not cruel
this cat was amazing, pretty and kewl!
Now the plan has succeded,
and we are together.
The pup and the kitty,
forever and ever."

Dance with the sun in the child’s laugh
Bouncing round off sinister things
Dance quickly now, with crystal prism
Scattering wisdom, melting wings
Dance with the rain in the child’s tear
Watching the clouds attack then stop
Dance quickly now, the storm has shattered
All that mattered, with a single drop
Dance with the hope in his stuttered speech
Holding it close for a later year
Dance quickly now, before he serves
Nonsense words, in a busted mirror

Though the moon may spin and the sun revolve
Though love still waits and the rain still falls
Though the child may laugh he glares inside
Exhaling life with a sudden sigh

52,Emotion,DancePoemsComeDanceWithMeParodyChristopherMarloweComeLiveWithMeAndBeMyLovePoembyJonathanROBIN,"Come dance with me and find release,
howl to the moon, with wild wolves run,
no nightmares now as heart finds peace, -
a stellar future crowned with fun
shall underwrite harvest increase
two reap together, story spun
from morn to night as worries cease,
while one and one at last make one.
Come dance we'll circumnavigate
the seven seas as zephyr’s breeze
anticipates and may translate
past cares to luck which soul strings frees.
Harp, Terpsichore shall play as Fate
unwinds past phantom_mime banshees,
life’s letter stamps ‘reciprocate’
inventing new realities.
Come dance with me, unlearn life’s woe
owe only to your inner voice
as chivalry and honour flow -
no need to justify your choice.
Slow motion – Time stood still – will throw
away wait’s weights as both rejoice
in unexpected overthrow
of anchors as trim sails we hoist.
Come dance with me, no strings attached –
except of harp or violin -
devotion, eloquence unmatched,
will shed all lies of ties that sin.
Thus inner doors may be unlatched,
as new dimensions open in
embracing wave which saves unscratched
soul stirred from hibernation’s bin.
Come dance with me, endearing smile
will echo caring, sharing, joy,
while Lara’s theme will reconcile
true love to trust, no wiles employ.
Tiara  crowned Princess no guile
may meet who, sweet, greets verse employ
as an expression timed to dial
away Time’s hands all else destroy.
Come dance with me, no judgment blind
will claim, will, blame, will shame, reject, -
all icicles soon left behind
Spring’s robin sings you’re soul elect.
From past which could be less unkind
we’ll destination fly direct
where all but lines are underlined,
no need for conduct circumspect.
Come dance, together we’ll unlearn
the past’s mistakes, to future fair
to promised land hand, hand, will turn
with light and laughter everywhere.
The seasons slip by, none return,
yet bird’s song echoes, in your hair
may make its nest, chirp soft, not spurn,
and answer questions pondered there.
Come dance with me, I’ll hold you tight,
In tenderness which knows no bounds,
Restoring hidden wings for flight
Tears soon shall ceasee, – for fears no grounds.
Here magic, comfort, and respite,
there melody received resounds,
acceptance and contentment quite
unmeasured pleasure ache impounds.
Come dance with me, and we will learn
what makes lips tingle, goose-bumps rise,
what makes spine shiver, plush blush burn
each day will bring some fresh surprise.
Eyes Isis envies will discern
from green to blue each spark that flies,
as touch, from glitter fairy’s fern
may guide, not steer, still share concern.
Come dance with me, I’ll always keep,
my word - a promise from my heart -
integrity runs very deep,
each part of each need never part.
Thus whether way is slope or steep
Until Earth’s end – which sings fresh start –
alert I’d watch awake, asleep,
protecting dreams from sudden start.
Come dance, from trap or golden cage,
forever free to spread your wings
in harmony which knows nor rage,
nor stings nor slaps, - where spirit sings
in ecstasy as, turning page,
we’ll Autumn sage and Summer’s swings
unite as, taking center stage,
Spring warmth from Winter’s tumult springs.
Come dance, your silent grace shall show
how one above, below, unique
shines out, from shadows free, whose glow
pre-empts necessity to speak.
From yesterdays the future’s flow
shall still remember tender cheek,
yet turn towards joy’s overflow,
life liberate from sadness, pique.
Come dance to tune which wounded heart
returns to health and inspiration
we’ll reel, we’ll heal, real hopes may chart
beyond old altar’s altercation.
Past struggles’ tide and tears depart,
as sun and moon anticipation
eliminate invasive dart,
while heralding emancipation.
Come dance with me, we’ll share the key
that opens inspiration’s portal
uncover wellspring’s latency -
spirit infinite, immortal, -
find answers to eternity
withheld from passing shadow mortal
as soul’s connection as one we
establish, spurn deceptions’ maw well.
Come dance with me, I’ve said before, -
who twice ten thousand lines could add, -
and here repeat for one time more
ambition plain: to turn sad glad.
If this sweet song your pleasure move
this greeting was inscribed Above
all let and hindrance swift remove –
come live with me and be my love …

The Passionate Shepherd to His Love – Come Live with Me and Be my Love
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
THE PASSIONATE SHEPHERD TO HIS LOVE
Come live with me and be my love,
And we will all the pleasures prove
That hills and valleys, dales and fields,
Or woods or steepy mountain yields.
And we will sit upon the rocks,
And see the shepherds feed their flocks
By shallow rivers, to whose falls
Melodious birds sing madrigals.
And I will make thee beds of roses
And a thousand fragrant posies,
A cap of flowers, and a kittle
Embroider’d all with leaves of myrtle,
A gown made of the finest wool
Which from our pretty lambs we pull.
Fair-lined slippers for the cold,
With buckles of the purest gold.
A belt of straw and ivy-buds
With coral clasps and amber studs:
And if these pleasures may thee move,
Come live with me and be my love.
Thy silver dishes for thy meat
As precious as the gods do eat,
Shall on an ivory table be
Prepared each day for thee and me.
The shepherd swains shall dance and sing
For thy delight each My morning,
If these delights thy mind may move,
then live with me and be my love.

COME LIVE WITH ME - THE NYMPH'S REPLY
If all the world and love were young,
And truth in every shepherd's tongue,
These pretty pleasures might me move
To live with thee and be thy Love.
But Time drives flocks from field to fold;
When rivers rage and rocks grow cold;
And Philomel becometh dumb;
The rest complains of cares to come.
The flowers do fade, and wanton fields
To wayward Winter reckoning yields:
A honey tongue, a heart of gall,
Is fancy's spring, but sorrow's fall.
Thy gowns, thy shoes, thy beds of roses,
Thy cap, thy kirtle, and thy posies,
Soon break, soon wither - soon forgotten,
In folly ripe, in reason rotten.
Thy belt of straw and ivy-buds,
Thy coral clasps and amber studs, -
All these in me no means can move
To come to thee and be thy Love.
But could youth last, and love still breed,
Had joys no date, nor age no need,
Then these delights my mind might move
To live with thee and be thy Love.

THE BAIT
Come live with me, and be my love,
And we will some new pleasures prove
Of golden sands, and crystal brooks,
With silken lines, and silver hooks.
There will the river whispering run
Warmed by thy eyes, more than the sun.
And there th'enamoured fish will stay,
Begging themselves they may betray.
When thou wilt swim in that live bath,
Each fish, which every channel hath,
Will amorously to thee swim,
Gladder to catch thee, than thou him.
If thou, to be so seen, be'st loth,
By sun, or moon, thou darkenest both,
And if myself have leave to see,
I need not their light, having thee.
Let others freeze with angling reeds,
And cut their legs, with shells and weeds,
Or treacherously poor fish beset,
With strangling snare, or windowy net:
Let coarse bold hands, from slimy nest
The bedded fish in banks out-wrest,
Or curious traitors, sleave silk flies
Bewitch poor fishes' wandering eyes.
For thee, thou need'st no such deceit,
For thou thyself art thine own bait,
That fish, that is not catched thereby,
Alas, is wiser far than I.

THE SHEPHERD TO HIS FAIR ONE
To Phillis, to love and live with him
Live, live with me, and thou shalt see
The pleasures I'll prepare for thee:
What sweets the country can afford
Shall bless thy bed, and bless thy board.
The soft sweet moss shall be thy bed,
With crawling woodbine over-spread:
By which the silver-shedding streams
Shall gently melt thee into dreams.
Thy clothing next, shall be a gown
Made of the fleeces' purest down.
The tongues of kids shall be thy meat;
Their milk thy drink; and thou shalt eat
The paste of filberts for thy bread
With cream of cowslips buttered:
Thy feasting-table shall be hills
With daisies spread, and daffadils;
Where thou shalt sit, and Red-breast by,
For meat, shall give thee melody.
I'll give thee chains and carcanets
Of primroses and violets.
A bag and bottle thou shalt have,
That richly wrought, and this as brave;
So that as either shall express
The wearer's no mean shepherdess.
At shearing-times, and yearly wakes,
When Themilis his pastime makes,
There thou shalt be; and be the wit,
Nay more, the feast, and grace of it.
On holydays, when virgins meet
To dance the heys with nimble feet,
Thou shalt come forth, and then appear
The Queen of Roses for that year.
And having danced ('bove all the best)
Carry the garland from the rest,
In wicker-baskets maids shall bring
To thee, my dearest shepherdling,
The blushing apple, bashful pear,
And shame-faced plum, all simp'ring there.
Walk in the groves, and thou shalt find
The name of Phillis in the rind
Of every straight and smooth-skin tree;
Where kissing that, I'll twice kiss thee.
To thee a sheep-hook I will send,
Be-prank'd with ribbands, to this end,
This, this alluring hook might be
Less for to catch a sheep, than me.
Thou shalt have possets, wassails fine,
Not made of ale, but spiced wine;
To make thy maids and self free mirth,
All sitting near the glitt'ring hearth.
Thou shalt have ribbands, roses, rings,
Gloves, garters, stockings, shoes, and strings
Of winning colours, that shall move
Others to lust, but me to love. -
These, nay, and more, thine own shall be,
If thou wilt love, and live with me.

COME LIVE WITH ME AND BE MY LOVE
Come, live with me and be my love,
And we will all the pleasures prove
Of peace and plenty, bed and board,
That chance employment may afford.
I’ll handle dainties on the docks
And thou shalt read of summer frocks:
At evening by the sour canals
We’ll hope to hear some madrigals.
Care on thy maiden brow shall put
A wreath of wrinkles, and thy foot
Be shod with pain: not silken dress
But toil shall tire thy loveliness.
Hunger shall make thy modest zone
And cheat fond death of all but bone –
If these delights thy mind may move,
Then live with me and be my love.

We’ll chase the wily holy buck

And we will dazzle in our clothes
and neon dazzle us as well.
We’ll strike a sleek and moneyed pose,
we’ll yell a blithe, ecstatic yell
until at last we’ve squandered all,
shot the wad and maxed the cards,
until we’ve quaffed till dawns appall
and hoarse are velvet-throated bards.
Come stroll with me and be my muse
of feckless hope and vain desire.
On the boardwalk the huckster woos
and Armless Annie tongues her lyre.

THE DISPASSIONATE SHEPHERDESS
Do not live with me, do not be my love.
And yet I think we may some pleasures prove
That who enjoy each other, in the haste
Of their most inward kissing, seldom taste.
Being absent from me, you shall still delay
To come to me, and if another day,
No matter, so your greeting burn as though
The words had all the while been picked in snow.
No other gift you'll offer me but such
As I can neither wear, nor smell, nor touch -
No flowers breathing of evening, and no stones
Whose chilly fire outlasts our skeletons.
You'll give me once a thought that stings, and once
A look to make my blood doubt that it runs.
You'll give me rough and sharp perplexities,
And never, never will you give me ease.
For one another's blessing not designed,
Marked for possession only of the mind,
And soon, because such cherishing is brief,
To ask whereon was founded our belief.
That there was anything at all uncommon
In what each felt for each as man and woman -
If this then be our case, if this our story,
Shall we rail at heaven? Shall we, at the worst, be sorry?
Heaven's too deaf, we should grow hoarse with railing,
And sorrow never quickened what was failing.
But if you think we thus may pleasures prove,
Do not live with me, do not be my love.

BACCHANAL
“Come live with me and be my love, ”
He said, in substance.  “There’s no vine
We will not pluck the clusters of,
Or grape we will not turn to wine.”
It’s autumn of their second year.
Now he, in seasonal pursuit,
With rich and modulated cheer,
Brings home the festive purple fruit;
And she, by passion once demented,
- That woman out of Botticelli –
She brews and bottles, unfermented,
The stupid and abiding jelly.

LOVE UNDER THE REPUBLICANS (OR DEMOCRATS)
Come live with me and be my love
And we will all the pleasures prove
Of a marriage conducted with economy
In the Twentieth Century Anno Donomy.
We’ll live in a dear little walk-up flat
With practically room to swing a cat
And a potted cactus to give it hauteur
And a bathtub equipped with dark brown water.
We’ll eat, without undue discouragement,
Foods low in cost but high in nouragement
And quaff with pleasure, while chatting wittily,
The peculiar wine of Little Italy.
We’ll remind each other it’s smart to be thrifty
And buy our clothes for something-fifty.
We’ll bus for miles on holidays
For seas at depressing matinees,
And every Sunday we’ll have a lark
And take a walk in Central Park.
And one of these days not too remote
You’ll probably up and cut my throat.

At Claridge thou shalt duckling eat,
Sip vintages both dry and sweet,
And thou shalt squeeze between thy lips
Asparagus with buttered tips.
On caviare my love shall graze,
And plump on salmon mayonnaise,
And browse at Scott’s beside thy swain
On lobster Newburg with champagne.
Between hors d’oeuvres and canapés
I’ll feast thee on poularde soufflé
And every day within thy reach
Pile melon, nectarine and peach.
Come share at the Savoy with me

If in these pastures thou wouldst rove
Then feed with me and be my love.

I love thee - I love thee!

The mellow lute upon those lips,
Whose tender tones entrance;
But most, dear heart of hearts, thy proofs
That still these words enhance.

“Oh come, my love, and seek with me
A realm by grosser eye unseen,
Where fairy forms will welcome thee,
And dainty creatures hail thee queen.
In silent pools the tube I’ll ply,
Where green conferva-threads lie curled,
And proudly bring to thy bright eye
The trophies of the protist world.
We’ll rouse the stentor from his lair,
And gaze into the cyclops ’ eye;
In chara and nitella hair
The protoplasmic stream descry,
For ever weaving to and fro
With faint molecular melody,
And curious rotifers I’ll show,
And graceful vorticellidae.
Where melicertae ply their craft
We’ll watch the playful water-bear,
And no envenomed hydra’s shaft
Shall mar our peaceful pleasure there;
But while we whisper love’ssweettale
We’ll trace, with sympathetic cart,
Within the embryonic snail
The growing rudimental heart.
Where rolls the volvox sphere of green,
And plastids move in Brownian dance -
If, wandering ‘mid that gentle scene,
Two fond amoebae shall perchance
Be changed to one beneath our sight
By process of biocrasis,
We’ll recognise, with rare delight,
A type of our prospective bliss.
Or dearer thou by far to me
In thy sweet maidenly estate
Than any seventy-fifth could be,
Of aperture however great!
Come, go with me and we will stray
Through realm by grosser eye unseen,
Where protophytes shall homage pay,
And protozoa hail thee queen.”

THE PASSIONATE HOUSEHOLDER TO HIS LOVE"
53,Emotion,DancePoemsDanceOfLifePoembyDavidHarris,"Sometimes we do the rumba,
a foxtrot or a jive,
as we dance through our life,
each and every day.
We dance and we dance,
each day through.
Everyday to a different tune,
just to get us through.
In all our loving moments,
we waltz through life,
and in those complicated moments,
we will twist the whole night through.
For everything we do,
there is a dance to get us through.
For every day,
we dance our life away.
17 June 2007"
54,Emotion,DancePoemsMyLastDancePoembyJuliaWardHowe,"The shell of objects inwardly consumed
Will stand, till some convulsive wind awakes;
Such sense hath Fire to waste the heart of things,
Nature, such love to hold the form she makes.
Thus, wasted joys will show their early bloom,
Yet crumble at the breath of a caress;
The golden fruitage hides the scathèd bough,
Snatch it, thou scatterest wide its emptiness.
For pleasure bidden, I went forth last night
To where, thick hung, the festal torches gleamed;
Here were the flowers, the music, as of old,
Almost the very olden time it seemed.
For one with cheek unfaded, (though he brings
My buried brothers to me, in his look,)
Said, `Will you dance? ' At the accustomed words
I gave my hand, the old position took.
Sound, gladsome measure! at whose bidding once
I felt the flush of pleasure to my brow,
While my soul shook the burthen of the flesh,
And in its young pride said, `Lie lightly thou! '
Then, like a gallant swimmer, flinging high
My breast against the golden waves of sound,
I rode the madd'ning tumult of the dance,
Mocking fatigue, that never could be found.
Chide not,- it was not vanity, nor sense,
(The brutish scorn such vaporous delight,)
But Nature, cadencing her joy of strength
To the harmonious limits of her right.
She gave her impulse to the dancing Hours,
To winds that sweep, to stars that noiseless turn;
She marked the measure rapid hearts must keep
Devised each pace that glancing feet should learn.
And sure, that prodigal o'erflow of life,
Unvow'd as yet to family or state,
Sweet sounds, white garments, flowery coronals
Make holy, in the pageant of our fate.
Sound, measure! but to stir my heart no more-
For, as I moved to join the dizzy race,
My youth fell from me; all its blooms were gone,
And others showed them, smiling, in my face.
Faintly I met the shock of circling forms
Linked each to other, Fashion's galley-slaves,
Dream-wondering, like an unaccustomed ghost
That starts, surprised, to stumble over graves.
For graves were 'neath my feet, whose placid masks
Smiled out upon my folly mournfully,
While all the host of the departed said,
`Tread lightly- thou art ashes, even as we.'"
55,Emotion,DancePoemsDanceHallGirlsPoembyRobertWilliamService,"Where are the dames I used to know
In Dawson in the days of yore?
Alas, it's fifty years ago,
And most, I guess, have ""gone before.""
The swinging scythe is swift to mow
Alike the gallant and the fair;
And even I, with gouty toe,
Am glad to fill a rocking chair.
Ah me, I fear each gaysome girl
Who in champagne I used to toast,
or cozen in the waltz's whirl,
In now alas, a wistful ghost.
Oh where is Touch The Button Nell?
Or Minnie Dale or Rosa Lee,
Or Lorna Doone or Daisy Bell?
And where is Montreal Maree?
Fair ladies of my lusty youth,
I fear that you are dead and gone:
Where's Gertie of the Diamond Tooth,
And where the Mare of Oregon?
What's come of Violet de Vere,
Claw-fingered Kate and Gumboot Sue?
They've crossed the Great Divide, I fear;
Remembered now by just a few.
A few who like myself can see
Through half a century of haze
A heap of goodness in their glee
And kindness in their wanton ways.
Alas, my sourdough days are dead,
Yet let me toss a tankard down . . .
Here's hoping that you wed and bred,
And lives of circumspection led,
Gay dance-hall girls o Dawson Town!"

Singing with the beat
tarrump tarrump tarrump
My eyes glisten as i hear a voice
perhaps one that has come to save me from my lonliness.
It draws nearer by the second
yet with each passing breath it sounds farther away
Have you come to dance with me?
Or have you brought with you some light?

My tears have become my blanket
they keep me safe and warm.

Once strong and proud and hopeful.
now weak and worthless and damned.

i once saw a healthy face
now cracked and scarred and starven
ugly with discrace.

Save my life, no matter how tattered, broken, or worn.

And, as true to her beam as the tides of the ocean,
Young hearts, when they feel the soft light of her eye,
Obey the mute call, and heave into motion.
Then, sound notes -  the gayest, the lightest,
That ever took wing, when heaven look'd brightest
Again! Again!
Oh! could such heart-stirring music be heard
In that City of Statues described by romancers,
So wakening its spell, even stone would be stirr'd,
And statues themselves all start into dancers!
Why then delay, with such sounds in our ears,
And the flower of Beauty's own garden before us -
While stars overhead leave the song of their spheres,
And, listening to ours, hang wondering o'er us?
Again, that strain! -  to hear it thus sounding
Might set even Death's cold pulses bounding -
Again! Again!
Oh, what delight when the youthful and gay
Each with eye like a sunbeam and foot like a feather,
Thus dance, like the Hours to the music of May,
And mingle sweet song and sunshine together."

They howl and writhe in shoals of torment, in fierce flames consuming,
In chains of iron and in dungeons circled with ceaseless fires,
In pits and dens and shades of death, in shapes of torment and woe:
The plates and screws and racks and saws and cords and fires and cisterns
The cruel joys of Luvah's Daughters, lacerating with knives
And whips their victims, and the deadly sport of Luvah's Sons.
They dance around the dying and they drink the howl and groan,
They catch the shrieks in cups of gold, they hand them to one another:
These are the sports of love, and these the sweet delights of amorous play,
Tears of the grape, the death sweat of the cluster, the last sigh
Of the mild youth who listens to the luring songs of Luvah."

Sweet of frankincense, and gifts, from birth
I’d dance for Father, Son, and even the Holy Ghost

I dance for the God's fishermen
Of the Gospel clan and Redemption's plan
As I’m sure, they’d all come with along me
We'd dance, together, on humanity's great sea
I’d dance on Sabbath, the Religionist to distain
I’d cure all the wounded, blind, and also the lame
I tell you: I dance in the Cross, for Victory so bright
For what's central to beauty and void envy's flight
If given a chance~ I’d even dance on the devil’s grave
For oh, I do love dancing for my Lord God and KING
I'm awesomely restored; how can I not but dance and sing"

and on stages just
out of reach of finger tips;
danced on daddy’s feet.
I’ve lost my breath,
drowning and it hurts so.
Daddy, dance me

On a merry-go-round?
Or listened to the rain

Or gazed at the sun into the fading night?
You better slow down.
Don't dance so fast.
Time is short.
The music won't last.
Do you run through each day
On the fly?
When you ask How are you?
Do you hear the reply?
When the day is done
Do you lie in your bed
With the next hundred chores
Running through your head?
You'd better slow down
Don't dance so fast.
Time is short.
The music won't last.
Ever told your child,
We'll
do it tomorrow?
And in your haste,
Not see his sorrow?
Ever lost touch,
Let a good friendship die
Cause you never had time
To call and say, 'Hi'
You'd better slow down.
Don't dance so fast.
Time is short.
The music won't last.
When you run so fast to get somewhere
You miss half the fun of getting there.
When you worry and hurry through your day,
It is like an unopened gift....
Thrown away.
Life is not a race.
Do take it slower
Hear the
music
Before the song is over."

Their legs were old burnt matches,
Their legs were old burnt matches,
Their arms were just the same.
They jigged and whirled and scrambled,
Jigged and whirled and scrambled,
Jigged and whirled and scrambled,
In honor of the dame,
The noble Irish lady
Who makes potatoes dance,
The witty Irish lady,
The saucy Irish lady,
The laughing Irish lady
Who makes potatoes prance.

""There was just one sweet potato.
He was golden brown and slim.
The lady loved his dancing,
The lady loved his dancing,
The lady loved his dancing,
She danced all night with him,
She danced all night with him.
Alas, he wasn't Irish.
So when she flew away,
They threw him in the coal-bin,
And there he is today,
Where they cannot hear his sighs
And his weeping for the lady,
The glorious Irish lady,
The beauteous Irish lady,
Who
Gives
Potatoes

69,Emotion,DancePoemsCosmicBalanceDancePoembyDanielHooks,"A little ray of hope across a midnight sky
A time for all time, a light to shine
Sunrise and sunset caught in one net
For ever fighting to stay one.
A moon and a sun wanting to be as one
To set together, in a time lost in forever
Earth moon and stars fade together
A longing that fades into forever
The Alpha and Omega fading in and out
Longing to be together but always in doubt
A rainbow brings hope,
A new way to cope
We all need thathope
To stop salt filled tears from falling
Oiling the way for another day"
70,Emotion,DancePoemsPoetsDancePoembyToneliusOliver,"Poets Dance in the heart of rhythms
Discussion spoken in the pen
Energy being tampered with in the music
Limitations rarely occur in audio-silence
Artist writes from the heart of rhythms
The Poets are dancing
Flaming hot ink drips from the pen
The paper it's a sacrificial victim
It just seems to lay still
there's no escape when the Poets Dance
Rhythmic heartbeats offset the confrontation
of clumsy feet
To tap dance on paper is a joy one must experience
to fully appreciate
It’s not for the faint-hearted"
71,Emotion,DancePoemsAntEnnaDancePoembyJoJoBean,"I'm sitting here at home
trying to write a simple poem
I'm staring at the floor
Not knowing whats in store
I see a trail of ants
then I try and take a stance
To get a closer look
and that was all it took...
I watched with fascination
One of the tiniest of creations
Communicate to each other
To their sisters and their brothers
It was funny at first glance
As it seemed to be a dance
They weren't using hands like us
It was a different kind of trust
They were using their antennas
To show what was on their new agenda
They would walk up to each other
Face to face but not to smother
Then their antennas start to fly
As they tickle in the sky
Passing along the information
On from station to new station
The words they passed along
Must have been so very strong
Because in their antenna dance
The ants seemed to be in such a trance
Even all the younger
seemed to have a little hunger
Every word was understood
To follow if they could
'Please, all step in line
and you'll find a place to dine! '

74,Emotion,DancePoemsSaturdayNightDancePoembyErnestineNorthover,"Looked forward to the Saturday Night dance
We did, all dressed up to 'shine',
With winkle picker shoes, and layers of net
In our petticoats.  We felt divine.
The 'hair do' backcombed to perfection,
The lipstick a bright Roman Pink,
The 10 denier stockings, were totally great,
And, that handsome Teddy Boy's wink!
Rock and roll, The Twist, The Locomotion,
Were the favourites of the day,
And then there was the 'smoochy' waltz,
When cheek to cheek, we could 'swoon' away.
You sat, until some bold young fella,
Would have the courage to ask you up,
To do 'The Jive' or the 'Cha Cha Cha',
Or to fetch you some wine to sup.
Some lads were delightful to dance with,
While others had two left feet,
But one would have to suffer them gladly,
If you wanted to, leave your seat.
Politeness would rule the evening,
And courtesy was really great,
When someone would give you a lift back home,
If the dance, went on too late.
Gone are those days of feeling feminine,
With the boys, debonair and bold,
But, Oh, it was so romantic then,
When you had a 'strong' hand to hold.
There was fun with the band playing loudly.
When being female, we dressed to 'kill',
And when men were Gents and treated us girls,
With, respect.  Now that was definitely 'BRILL'!

75,Emotion,DancePoemsYouDancePoembyLawrenceSPertillar,"Dancing out of rhyme and reason.
Lacking rhythm with a pace too aged,
For the times you are behind.
And yet you request your steps be followed.
No one seems to have the nerve or courage,
To tell you...
Nothing you do nourishes to flourish!
They would rather watch you in the spotlight...
With efforts that make them sick to their stomachs,
Instead of telling you...
Not only are you out of your mind,
But the time you waste is no longer ours to give.
You dance...
Although the melody in your head has to stop!
We're just waiting for someone with heart enough...
To drag you off the floor!"

I cannot dance upon my Toes—

Would put itself abroad
In Pirouette to blanch a Troupe—
Or lay a Prima, mad,
And though I had no Gown of Gauze—
No Ringlet, to my Hair,
Nor hopped to Audiences—like Birds,
One Claw upon the Air,
Nor tossed my shape in Eider Balls,
Nor rolled on wheels of snow
Till I was out of sight, in sound,

We always dance
and take the chance
to enjoy and satisfy
with enough of the joy
it takes place in the social gathering
and really pleasing
one's self while someone is praising
and applauding your skill
it is getting lost
in the noisy atmosphere
the loud sound and so many voices around
the real joy is never found
Your combine and dance
when inner joy wants to take a chance
your mind and heart is tuned
and you go for it to define
there is no mismatch
you are trying to catch the real pulse
that emanates from the deep inside
and without losing the time, you decide to dance

everywhere,
When I look at the sky,
I see the clouds dance
Into steps of winds
My heart dance when I watch clouds dance!
How it can make me dance?
Without any tune or beats,
Its own beats me my heart dance.
Some strange tune it sings in silence and dance!
When I see at shore of ocean waves that dance,
Some birds in sky fly and dance,
On the waves boats that to the tune of waves, dance,
My mind sing lyricless
music to which it dance!
When I walk along the beach,
The headless crown of palm trees with wide open hands dance,
Watching them dance trees start their dance!
When I on countryside, green paddy  fields dance,
Looking at them, the bird on the branch dance!
When walk along, trees with fruits dance,
And to its own rustling music,  leaves dance!
When I walk in the park,
Plants  with flowers dance!
Looking at the graceful dance flowerless  dance,
When I move on street, hope and hap dance,
Seeing at them even hopeless an hapless to dance!
Smile on faces with hope dance,
Wrinkles on the forehead of hapless dance!
When I look at people in them mind dance,
In some happiness dance,
In some sorrowfulness dance,
Some I found with desperation dance
In some their laziness dance,
In some saintliness dance,
Most of the time wickedness dance,
And in some other dreams that dance!
Success that dance with some,
Distress that in unsuccessful dance,
In some hearts mercy that dance
Together with love and kindness dance!
Some where cookedness dance,
And some where innocence dance,
In every nation either hunger dance,
Or in people's mind anger that dance,
Either corruption in corrupt mind dance,
Or those systems on the heart of people dance!
Dance, dance, dance everywhere,
It is time for my soulful dance,
If you see somewhere some other type of dance
Just sing it dance
and let no other see the pain in your heart dance
Hide it with that unfailable lips on which smile may dance
Dance, Dance, dance,
Tune your steps with eternal dance!"

Taking the steps in pairs
my legs faltered at his door -
paralyzed by denial.
Forcing myself inside,
I saw father's lifeless frame,
wired to synthetic everything -
a cold white line
still against the black.
My aching soul
railed at that liar screen,
knowing his true lifeline
danced with passion  -
precision cutting with his lathe,
strumming passing chords
on his Gibson Les Paul.
That morning I knocked a ball
through a neighbor’s glass
I learned what honor meant.
With dad's steady hand
on my  shoulder,
I stammered  apologies
and learned to glaze a window.
We'd play catch after supper.
or down franks and pop
at Briggs where the Tigers played.
Detroit is flying high this year:
God, how I wish
I could give the old man a call.

In a heaven that’s spinning.

These words that are dancing are free!

87,Emotion,DancePoemsBlubberVisitsTheDanceHallPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"At first I thought she waltzed,
but then I saw the error of
my observation powers.
She waddled, all that blubber,
garnished with shoulder pads,
covert suspenders and duct tape,
size called 'infinity', a wave
of air preceded the mass,
mostly the temperature was high
but in the noise of raucous laughter
it was hard to tell what happened.
Yes, men were at her feet, all over
the dancing hall, though hardwood
on a polished floor is without comfort.
No one was able to keep standing,
it was too much to grin and bear.
Majestic gestures emanated, clearly,
there was confusion as to the identity
and origin, was this thing human then?
And, in the end it was decided that
it had been good to have this episode,
though fleeting pay its short visit,
although the most intriguing part
about the thing, consisted of its skills
to speak of things that human beings
hold dear, some raunchy stuff included.
And all were shocked, though pretty glad
when hardwood planks did give and cracked,
and Blubber sank to vanish through the hole,
from where some devils must have grabbed
to commandeer the energy, all the triglycerides,
not food for thought but something quite substantial."

On those clear and cloudless nights?
Did she ever wash the dishes?

Time have made of our new loving
Or was it moving out of sight?
Did she ever fully love you?
Or did she merely say she did?
Did she sometimes feel too tired?
Or did she not have any kids?
Did you simply just forget me?
Why did you let my passion die?
Why did you never ever let me
Just be me so i could fly?"

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
Have you ever watched kids
On a merry-go-round?
Or listened to the rain
Slapping on the ground?
Ever followed a butterfly's erratic
flight? Or gazed at the sun into
the fading night?
You better slow down.
Don't dance so fast.
Time is short.
The music won't last.
Do you run through each day
On the fly?
When you ask How are you?
Do you hear the reply?
When the day is done
Do you lie in your bed
With the next hundred chores
Running through your head?
You'd better slow down
Don't dance so fast.
Time is short.
The music won't last.
Ever told your child,
We'll do it tomorrow?
And in your haste,
Not see his sorrow?
Ever lost touch,
Let a good friendship die
Cause you never had time
To call and say hi
You'd better slow down.
Don't dance so fast.
Time is short.
The music won't last.
When you run so fast to get somewhere
You miss half the fun of getting there.
When you worry and hurry through your
day, It is like an unopened
gift....
Thrown away.
Life is not a race.
Do take it slower
Hear the music
Before the song is over."
91,Emotion,DancePoemsDanceFigurePoembyEzraPound,"For the Marriage in Cana of Galilee
Dark-eyed,
O woman of my dreams,
Ivory sandalled,
There is none like thee among the dancers,
None with swift feet.
I have not found thee in the tents,
In the broken darkness.
I have not found thee at the well-head
Among the women with pitchers.
Thine arms are as a young sapling under the bark;
Thy face as a river with lights.
White as an almond are thy shoulders;
As new almonds stripped from the husk.
They guard thee not with eunuchs;
Not with bars of copper.
Gilt turquoise and silver are in the place of thy rest.
A brown robe, with threads of gold woven in
patterns, hast thou gathered about thee,
O Nathat-Ikanaie, 'Tree-at-the-river'.
As a rillet among the sedge are thy hands upon me;
Thy fingers a frosted stream.
Thy maidens are white like pebbles;
Their music about thee!
There is none like thee among the dancers;
None with swift feet."

And I dance.
And it's graceful,
When you think.
Be passionate
With your movements,
Listen to the song,
The beats,
the rhythyms,
And flow.
And dance.

93,Emotion,DancePoemsTheDanceAtThePhoenixPoembyThomasHardy,"TO Jenny came a gentle youth
From inland leazes lone;
His love was fresh as apple-blooth
By Parrett, Yeo, or Tone.
And duly he entreated her
To be his tender minister,
And call him aye her own.
Fair Jenny's life had hardly been
A life of modesty;
At Casterbridge experience keen
Of many loves had she
From scarcely sixteen years above:
Among them sundry troopers of
The King's-Own Cavalry.
But each with charger, sword, and gun,
Had bluffed the Biscay wave;
And Jenny prized her gentle one
For all the love he gave.
She vowed to be, if they were wed,
His honest wife in heart and head
From bride-ale hour to grave.
Wedded they were. Her husband's trust
In Jenny knew no bound,
And Jenny kept her pure and just,
Till even malice found
No sin or sign of ill to be
In one who walked so decently
The duteous helpmate's round.
Two sons were born, and bloomed to men,
And roamed, and were as not:
Alone was Jenny left again
As ere her mind had sought
A solace in domestic joys,
And ere the vanished pair of boys
Were sent to sun her cot.
She numbered near on sixty years,
And passed as elderly,
When, in the street, with flush of fears,
On day discovered she,
From shine of swords and thump of drum,
Her early loves from war had come,
The King's Own Cavalry.
She turned aside, and bowed her head
Anigh Saint Peter's door;
""Alas for chastened thoughts!"" she said;
""I'm faded now, and hoar,
And yet those notes--they thrill me through,
And those gay forms move me anew
As in the years of yore!""...
--'Twas Christmas, and the Phoenix Inn
Was lit with tapers tall,
For thirty of the trooper men
Had vowed to give a ball
As ""Theirs"" had done (fame handed down)
When lying in the self-same town
Ere Buonaparté's fall.
That night the throbbing ""Soldier's Joy,""
The measured tread and sway
Of ""Fancy-Lad"" and ""Maiden Coy,""
Reached Jenny as she lay
Beside her spouse; till springtide blood
Seemed scouring through her like a flood
That whisked the years away.
She rose, and rayed, and decked her head
To hide her ringlets thin;
Upon her cap two bows of red
She fixed with hasty pin;
Unheard descending to the street,
She trod the flags with tune-led feet,
And stood before the Inn.
Save for the dancers', not a sound
Disturbed the icy air;
No watchman on his midnight round
Or traveller was there;
But over All-Saints', high and bright,
Pulsed to the music Sirius white,
The Wain by Bullstake Square.
She knocked, but found her further stride
Checked by a sergeant tall:
""Gay Granny, whence come you?"" he cried;
""This is a private ball.""
--""No one has more right here than me!
Ere you were born, man,"" answered she,
""I knew the regiment all!""
""Take not the lady's visit ill!""
Upspoke the steward free;
""We lack sufficient partners still,
So, prithee let her be!""
They seized and whirled her 'mid the maze,
And Jenny felt as in the days
Of her immodesty.
Hour chased each hour, and night advanced;
She sped as shod with wings;
Each time and every time she danced--
Reels, jigs, poussettes, and flings:
They cheered her as she soared and swooped
(She'd learnt ere art in dancing drooped
From hops to slothful swings).
The favorite Quick-step ""Speed the Plough""--
(Cross hands, cast off, and wheel)--
""The Triumph,"" ""Sylph,"" ""The Row-dow dow,""
Famed ""Major Malley's Reel,""
""The Duke of York's,"" ""The Fairy Dance,""
""The Bridge of Lodi"" (brought from France),
She beat out, toe and heel.
The ""Fall of Paris"" clanged its close,
And Peter's chime told four,
When Jenny, bosom-beating, rose
To seek her silent door.
They tiptoed in escorting her,
Lest stroke of heel or chink of spur
Should break her goodman's snore.
The fire that late had burnt fell slack
When lone at last stood she;
Her nine-and-fifty years came back;
She sank upon her knee
Beside the durn, and like a dart
A something arrowed through her heart
In shoots of agony.
Their footsteps died as she leant there,
Lit by the morning star
Hanging above the moorland, where
The aged elm-rows are;
And, as o'ernight, from Pummery Ridge
To Maembury Ring and Standfast Bridge
No life stirred, near or far.
Though inner mischief worked amain,
She reached her husband's side;
Where, toil-weary, as he had lain
Beneath the patchwork pied
When yestereve she'd forthward crept,
And as unwitting, still he slept
Who did in her confide.
A tear sprang as she turned and viewed
His features free from guile;
She kissed him long, as when, just wooed.
She chose his domicile.
Death menaced now; yet less for life
She wished than that she were the wife
That she had been erstwhile.
Time wore to six. Her husband rose
And struck the steel and stone;
He glanced at Jenny, whose repose
Seemed deeper than his own.
With dumb dismay, on closer sight,
He gathered sense that in the night,
Or morn, her soul had flown.
When told that some too mighty strain
For one so many-yeared
Had burst her bosom's master-vein,
His doubts remained unstirred.
His Jenny had not left his side
Betwixt the eve and morning-tide:
--The King's said not a word.
Well! times are not as times were then,
Nor fair ones half so free;
And truly they were martial men,
The King's-Own Cavalry.
And when they went from Casterbridge
And vanished over Mellstock Ridge,
'Twas saddest morn to see."
94,Emotion,DancePoemsOvertureToADanceOfLocomotivesPoembyWilliamCarlosWilliams,"Men with picked voices chant the names
of cities in a huge gallery: promises
that pull through descending stairways
to a deep rumbling.
The rubbing feet
of those coming to be carried quicken a
grey pavement into soft light that rocks
to and fro, under the domed ceiling,
across and across from pale
earthcolored walls of bare limestone.
Covertly the hands of a great clock
go round and round! Were they to
move quickly and at once the whole
secret would be out and the shuffling
of all ants be done forever.
A leaning pyramid of sunlight, narrowing
out at a high window, moves by the clock:
disaccordant hands straining out from
a center: inevitable postures infinitely
repeated--
two--twofour--twoeight!
Porters in red hats run on narrow platforms.
This way ma'am!
--important not to take
the wrong train!
Lights from the concrete
ceiling hang crooked but--
Poised horizontal
on glittering parallels the dingy cylinders
packed with a warm glow--inviting entry--
pull against the hour. But brakes can
hold a fixed posture till--
The whistle!
Not twoeight. Not twofour. Two!
Gliding windows. Colored cooks sweating
in a small kitchen. Taillights--
In time: twofour!
In time: twoeight!
--rivers are tunneled: trestles
cross oozy swampland: wheels repeating
the same gesture remain relatively
stationary: rails forever parallel
return on themselves infinitely.
The dance is sure."

We gathered weapons in, anger

Ripping and flailing about of limbs, acts
Against greater odds, desperate thoughts
Lingering for eternity between hot breaths
Sweat of common and high ranking
Mingled with battle fluids crushed
Beneath wild gaze and maiden strengths
Slipping about every heart, our fallen
Purged to the surface in anguish
Unblemeshed ghost fathers
Nagging the mete of our worth
Dispatched at ever more familiar foe
Pressing fate amid this clumsy waltz
Of true victory none, then weary home"
99,Emotion,DancePoemsTheLungiDanceYouHaveNoDanceItemToDoPoembyBijayKantDubey,"You have no dance item to do
Barring this lungi dance,
Taking full air,
The lungi dance is
But a loafer's dance
And the lungi cannot come to anyone's rescue
During the chilly winter.
The lungi dance, the lungi dance
The loafer saying and whistling it
And dancing in his go as you like style,
Dancing and whistling,
The lungi no dress is it,
But the loafer's dance."
100,Emotion,FootballPoemsFootballPoembyFredBabbin,"With Apologies to Oliver Twist and everybody else.
Football, glorious football.
Don't care what it looks like -.
Burned! Underdone! Crude!
Don't care what those crooks like.
Just thinking of growing fat.-
Our senses go reeling.
One moment of knowing that
Full-up feeling from sitting on
the couch!
Football, glorious football!
What wouldn't we give for
That extra bit more,
that's all that we should live for.
Why should we be fated
to do nothing but brood
on football,
magical football,
wonderful football,
marvelous football,
fabulous football,
beautiful football,
glorious football!"
101,Emotion,FootballPoemsBaseballFootballBoxingFishingGolfPumpingIronPoembyTomZart,"A game called prison ball was enjoyed in France
while English boys played rounder in short pants.
Town ball was the game that Americans played
While friends and family watched from the shade.
American baseball became alive
With Cartwright's rules of 1845.
Civil War soldiers played behind the lines
To help pass time and soothe troubled minds.
Professional baseball got its start
When the National League performed its part.
Soon after fans would pay to see the games
As the players traveled by boats and trains.
From April to October, players play.
Half the time at home and half away.
By thirty, it's time for most to retire
Before they're consumed by game time desire.
FOOTBALL
The stands are full of eager fans
Who say, we're paid too much money!
But if they would put our suits on
They'd find football isn't funny.
Twenty-two men and five referees
Chasing a pigskin, air filled ball.
Mashing and bashing all the way
Till the striped shirts whistle their call.
All the generals on the sideline
Are waging their athletic war.
And the letters in the words they use
Never amount to more than four.
There's no substitute for winning
And no excuse for losing.
Though after games; when we can't sleep
It's because of all the bruising.
BOXERS, PAST & PRESENT
The Greek and Roman athletes
Wore studs of iron on each hand
Beating and clawing each other
Like two tigers on the sand.
The English called it boxing first
To pound someone with your fist.
Mostly it was done for money
But sometimes by those just pissed.
Matches of the bare-knuckle days
Lasted fifty rounds or more
Till one man's towel would be thrown in
As he lay upon the floor.
Boxers now use soft leather gloves
With their hands wrapped in cotton.
Wearing a mouthpiece for teeth and lips
They fight like those forgotten.
BESIDES LOVE MEN NEED FISHING
Besides love men need fishing
And for both, most are wishing
Catching trophies chosen best
To be envied by the rest.
Fishing is a game of sport
Loved by all, both tall and short.
We must fool the fish’s eye
If we plan to stir and fry.
Some use boats while others wade
As they fish the sun or shade.
Ice-cold drinks help pass the day
While life’s troubles fade away.
Most men feel they've everything
With their rod, hook, cork and string.
Be it river, pond or lake
We all pray our line won't break.
GOLF
Many games were played with a stick and ball
As far back as the early days of man
Till the 14th century, golfers teed off
At St. Andrews, Scotland with clubs in hand.
Today men and women both play golf
As a group or just one or two.
Players, rich, poor, pro, or in between
Practice their swing with clubs, old and new.
They don't go thirsty cause they bring their own
Whatever it takes to enjoy the day.
Sometimes they play several games at once
As they win money or give it away.
There's nothing better than a green golf course
With the sweet scent of spring in the air.
To escape the drudgery of the workplace
Where you can laugh, joke, brag, gamble and swear.
PUMPING IRON
Except for love, there's nothing beats a good workout
Pumping iron with dumbbells or a bench press bar.
You're muscles grow tight as you begin to swell
And those who like firmness want to know who you are.
From 16 to 60 you can still look good
Though they'll be some who will point, laugh, and make fun.
Pay no attention to whatever they say
For  the jokes on them, when they're naked in the sun.
History's Sampson, the biblical strong man
Was blessed with the strength of no other.
A modern man who pumps iron and gives it his all
Before he knows it, could pass for his brother.
So put aside the pop, beer, hotdogs and chips
And pump earth's iron for the rest of your life
Soon you’ll discover the best of yourself
And always have someone for a girlfriend or wife."
102,Emotion,FootballPoemsForOneFootballPoembyFrancisDuggan,"In some ways humanity does not seem advanced at all
People in their physical prime tussling over possession of one football
They ought to get a football each with for to play
And for many it would be just as enjoyable for to watch anyway
People making a hero out of a person driving fast in a racing car
For a sport fanatic you need not walk that far
In fact no further than your local pub where on t v on a Saturday
They cheer when their favorite team their opponents outplay
If people were more interested in the welfare of Mother Earth than in sports we would have a better World to live in
A healthier Mother Earth for us all would be a great win
Huge amounts of money attending sporting and entertainment events people does spend
On causing pollution travelling to such events we are not Mother Earth's friend
Despite advancement in technology and science in some ways we are not advanced at all
Many go to watch young people competing for the possession of one football."

Spanish Football,
And like the muse of your love in the land of the Flamingos! !
But, the legs won the game;
Oh yes, winning the World Cup and the European Cup.
Life is like one big road with lots of signs!
So, don not complicate your mind when you drive along;
For, i've got a job to do as well."
104,Emotion,FootballPoemsFootballTheMostBeautifulGamePoembyRohanRoy,"After stepping into the field
there is no way out
even before you start the game
you hear the fans shout
The players then sings their anthem
its football......
the most beautiful game.....
And when the whistle blows
the crowd starts their roar
in the 90 tensed minutes
the players got to score
Football is friendly only in name
because friendliness is not meant for football....
the most beautiful game....
So when the hard tackles go in
and injured fellow goes out
the crowd becomes furious
and starts to shout
Even after breaking one's leg
there seems to be no shame
because its football....
the most beautiful game...."
105,Emotion,FootballPoemsAFootballMilePoembyTheresaAnnMoore,"He was undersized
compared to his peers
He waited for his chance
to catch the toss
He ran the final points
that cinched the win
Cheers and accolades
swirled all around
The spectators stood tall
and high-fived
He took it all in stride
smiling shyly
It was his only touchdown
of the season
He was a modest
one-time football hero

As we feel sorry for the losers
We love women, without them, we're nobody
Women are the fruits and the gems of our society
Whoopee! Congratulations to the USA Women's Soccer Team
For winning their fourth World Cup. This is a dream
For everybody to be champions
This is an outstanding accomplishment
Let's all enjoy this wonderful moment
Hurrah! Yippee! These women are heroes of actions
We are proud of them. They deserve at least equal pay
For equal work. I pray that nothing stands in their way
Thank you for the great soccer/football skills
That you have shown throughout the tournament
In France.Your ladies are lovely, winsome and elegant
You inspire me and give me enough energies and chills
To never give up, to work hard or to strive to succeed
May God grant all good health to survive and to lead!

It can be dangerous as a knife
But if you have fun
Anything can be done
Every minute of it
Is worth every hit
Ever touch of the ball
Makes me recall
That goal
That makes football my soul"
108,Emotion,FootballPoemsToBeGoodAtFootballPoembyFrancisDuggan,"To be good at football assures one of local fame
Though outside of your hometown yours is not a known name
For there is quite a difference between good and great
And outside of their hometown local heroes few know of to celebrate
The difference between local, national and Worldwide is huge one can say
And the local heroes as the local heroes do stay
Until the local heroes slow beyond their physical prime
And eventually the local heroes do lose out to time
To be good at football in your hometown
Assures you for awhile of local renown
But the fame of the local heroes in time fades away
And there are young local football heroes in the town today
It does not take that much to be a local hero at all
Since many become local heroes for being good at football."
109,Emotion,FootballPoemsFootballAndBasketballPoembyRmShanmugamChettiar,"Let children play football or basketball.
They would experience camaraderie,
Team spirit and togetherness.
They would learn bearing failures and defeats
And abiding by rules and regulation.
They would develop reflex action
Necessary for spontaneous response.
They would develop a steel physique.
Let children waste in football or basketball.

111,Emotion,FootballPoemsTheFootballGrandFinalScapegoatPoembyFrancisDuggan,"Most of those who knew him thought he was not good enough
He could not measure up when the going  did get tough
In the Grand Final he wilted under pressure with the game to be won
When he could have become the town's favourite son.
On the final siren he did take the mark that should have won the game
And he had the chance for to make for himself a name
Thirty metres out straight in front of the posts his side two points down
Had he kicked a goal he'd be toast of the town.
His poorly placed kick slightly curled in the wind
And went through the one point posts to record a behind
From the opposition fans a thunderous roar
By a single point their team had kicked the winning score.
After that disappointment last September he gave football away
In his life's twenty first year he'll be twenty two in May
But the past it has gone can't keep a good one down
And this week he is the hero of the town.
At the fire in Donello's house a boy's cry for help he did hear
At the risk of great danger to his life he conquered the fear
He went into the flames and dragged nine year old Franscesco out
When true courage was needed his was not in doubt.
Mr and Mrs Donello lost their home to the fire but their son's life he did save
In the gap of danger only the bravest are brave
He saved a young life which is more important than all of the Grand Finals ever played
Yet for him for that there won't be a parade."
112,Emotion,FootballPoemsMyOldFootballPoembyJohnMiltonHayes,"YOU can keep your antique silver and your statuettes of bronze,
Your curios and tapestries so fine,
But of all your treasures rare there is nothing to compare
With this patched up, wornout football pal o’ mine.
Just a patchedup wornout football, yet how it clings!
I live again my happier days in thoughts that football brings.
It’s got a mouth, it’s got a tongue,
And oft when we’re alone I fancy that it speaks
To me of golden youth that’s flown.
It calls to mind our meeting,
’Twas a present from the Dad.
I kicked it yet I worshipped it,
How strange a priest it had!
And yet it jumped with pleasure
When I punched it might and main:
And when it had the dumps
It got blown up and punched again.
It’s lived its life;
It’s played the game;
Its had its rise and fall,
There’s history in the wrinkles of that wornout football.
Caresses rarely came its way in babyhood ’twas tanned.
It’s been well oiled, and yet it’s quite teetotal, understand.
It’s gone the pace, and sometimes it’s been absolutely bust,
And yet ’twas always full of bounce,
No matter how ’twas cussed.
He’s broken many rules and oft has wandered out of bounds,
He’s joined in shooting parties
Over other people’s grounds.
Misunderstood by women,
He was never thought a catch,
Yet he was never happier
Than when bringing off a match.
He’s often been in danger
Caught in nets that foes have spread,
He’s even come to life again
When all have called him dead.
Started on the centre,
And he’s acted on the square,
To all parts of the compass
He’s been bullied everywhere.
His aims and his ambitious
Were opposed by one and all,
And yet he somehow reached his goal
That plucky old football.
When schooling days were ended
I forgot him altogether,
And ’midst the dusty years
He lay a crumpled lump of leather.
Then came the threat’ning voice of War,
And games had little chance,
My brother went to do his bit
Out there somewhere in France.
And when my brother wrote he said,
‘Of all a Tommy’s joys,
There’s none compares with football.
Will you send one for the boys? ’
I sent not one but many,
And my old one with the rest,
I thought that football’s finished now,
But no he stood the test.
Behind the lines they kicked him
As he’d never been kicked before.
Till they busted him and sent him back
A keepsake of the war.
My brother lies out there in France,
Beneath a simple cross,
And I seem to feel my football knows my grief,
And shares my loss.
He tells me of that splendid charge,
And then my brother’s fall.
In life he loved our mutual chum
That worn-out football.
Oh you can keep your antique silver
And your statuettes of bronze
Your curios and tapestries so fine
But of all your treasures rare
There is nothing to compare
With that patched-up worn-out football—
Pal o’ mine."
113,Emotion,FootballPoemsTheDyingExFootballChampionPoembyFrancisDuggan,"Around his bed his friends and family but of them he's not aware
His life's journey about to end old Joe the ex footballer player
On his back his eyes closed to his surroundings the life from him ebbing away
Last month he celebrated his eightieth birthday and today his life's final day.
Pre-deceased by his wife Mel she died five years ago
The last two years of his life's journey for him painful and slow
Most of those he played with and against in his football years to the Reaper long gone
But like the battler that he is to the end he's battling on.
Fifty five years ago the Captain of the great Premiership team
By football fans from near and far he was held in high esteem
But time takes care of everyone and everyone means all
And time has also taken toll of the champion of football.
Around his bed his friends and family a silent vigil keep
The end of his life's journey no more than an hour away he is in his final sleep
'Tis a fact those who love life do find it hard to die
But 'tis also a fact that all human beings are mortals and facts do never lie."

115,Emotion,FootballPoemsNoFootballPoembyRuthWalters,"When we first met we didn't,
it wasn't on the menu.
Of course it had me curious
I gave it much attention.
In April we indulged,
we were so very proud,
bouncing on the sofa
we did it in the lounge!
Later, in July
there was a time, I think
when we hit all the high notes
a few times by the sink.
In Autumn he got lazy
all this just had him spent
so I baked him pastries
and he ate those instead.
New Year was so merry
we drunk all Daddy's Sherry
I think perhaps we did it,
I wasn't really with it.
Last time was the best
and lasted quite a while
it was in Central Park
We had a bloomin' lark.
These days we just don't,
he's got so fat and heavy,
except for when we're bored
and no football's on the telly."

117,Emotion,FootballPoemsBallydalysGaelicFootballGloryDaysPoembyFrancisDuggan,"I've heard that Ballydaly does not have a football team
Which puts a cloud on Tommy Tucker's dream
That they might win Duhallow for third time
And give some bard another chance to rhyme.
They won their first Duhallow title more than forty years ago
Some time back in the fifties that I know
Though of my dates I'm not too very clear
I think 'twas fifty seven was the year.
When Ballydaly had their first big win
And their footballers were celebtated men
And John Twomey wrote of Ballydaly Boys
And west of Millstreet bonfires lit the skies.
The Sullivans, the Buckleys, Jerome and Paddy Ring
Of them the famous Mushera bard did sing,
Tom Mulcahy and Tim Kiely at the back
To Cullen forwards pressure would not crack.
Jack Murphy and Con Kelleher were supreme
Their goals took fight out of the Cullen team
And Pat Joe Kelleher brought his skill to play
And Andy Lynch at midfield won the day.
Big Jerry Corkery played a true captain's part
And sturdy Mick Horgan not lacking in heart
And Pat and Eddy Murphy cheered in victory
It's nice to recall such a memory.
And of them all the Mushera bard did sing
And of how Danny Regan called each player a king
Such memories I retain from years gone by
When I was young a Primary school going boy.
But for Ballydaly a near two decades wait
Before their fans again would celebrate
I think it was in nineteen seventy five
When Ballydaly once more came alive.
Some of those fellows I remember well
They scorned the word defeat and laughed at hell
The Twomey brothers Denis, Tim and Dan
Could hold their own with any man to man.
Con Connors who was a teenager then
Years later he mixed it with the best of men
I watched him play for Millstreet in the green
And for Cork in the red he too was seen.
His brother Tim his passing caused much grief
He died quite young his life was far too brief
He did not even live to see his prime
The poor lad was not granted so much time.
As his two brothers had done years before
The Ballydaly colours Ted Ring wore
And Tadgh and Denis Murphy stood the test
In the field of play they always gave their best.
The Keeffes from Knocknalummin gave their all
And the Leary brothers fought for every ball
And D Dinneen that marvellous personality
How could he ever slip the memory.
Denny John Murphy his dad from Lisnaboy
A hardy sort he gave it his best try
And Frank Hickey could run and run all day
And Kanturk's Mullane also lined out to play.
Big John Murphy may not have been in that team
But on his day the big man was supreme
And of Dave, John and Christy Tarrant opponents used to say
From toughest challenge they'd not back away.
And Dan Joe Casey to his colours true
And in his time a handy player too
And the Moynihans and the McCarthys John and Joe
Too played for Ballydaly years ago.
So many players since Con and Bill Jack's day
For Ballydaly took the field to play
John Regan and the Sullivans Tom and Mick
And Humphrey Reardon he was strong and quick.
And though as a weight lifter he won all of his fame
Big J.J. Fitz another I could name
And there were more far too many to recall
Who for Ballydaly played gaelic football
And it puts a cloud on Tommy Tucker's dream
If Ballydaly does not have a football team
That they might win Duhallow for third time
And give some bard another chance to rhyme."
118,Emotion,FootballPoemsFootballAndTvFootfallPoembyAniruddhaPathak,"Here, a handful of hysterical men
Seeming to run aimless for endless hours
In a display of sweat-soaked endeavours,
The men that ah together only can.
Now fighting longer tenure of the ball,
Well past the goal-line thence in testing time,
Grit and guts, gumption getting mixed with grime,
O to hold whole beholding world in thrall.
This, whilst million squatters on cushioned chairs,
Millions of crazy, stiffly lazy bones
Called couch potatoes all with expert airs,
Sit immobile, limp like lifeless mile-stones,
Who, can well do with their own grit and gall,
But would much rather cheer than chase the ball.

119,Emotion,FootballPoemsTheFootballPlayersYouPretendToLovePoembyRobertRorabeck,"Into your houses that stand for nothing—popcorn light
That gets blinded on the 4th of July
While I steal the lonely bicycle from your garage:
And I was your high school teacher for a week
While the rain melted the cages of your suburban harpies:
And they got up and spied
And spied upon the real world like a buffet:
And you grew older, tending to know older men from their
Various aircraft carriers—maybe even you spied one
The you even fancied to love until you decided that you
Had to look away and away—
Until you midnight happened that very September, while
All of your teachers were writing poetry except for the one
That never was—
And I right to you on this night approaching the first
Day of autumn—already the world is old and virtually
Defeated—looking for our heroes, I cannot say where
They have gone—I only know that they've taken
Their time to fend off the everyday monsters just so you
Can go to class tomorrow—following the shadows of
The football players you pretend to love."
120,Emotion,FootballPoemsSupposeFootballDoesServeAPurposePoembyFrancisDuggan,"Suppose football does serve a purpose some males do need other interests in their lives
Than working or drinking of alcohol or arguing with or making love to their girl friends or wives
On saturday they go to the football to cheer on their team win or lose
'Tis better for them than going to the local and wasting their money on the booze
At least watching football they won't be losing brain cells as they do when they are on the grog
And next day feeling nauseated and hung over and as sick as a very sick dog
Their partners and wives happy to see them going to the football for to support their football club
They feel that for them it is far better than guzzling down grog at the pub
In football there can be disappointments when your team does not win the game
But for every winner there is a loser and to lose should never be a shame
There's more to life than grog and work and women there is that marvellous game known as football
To you and many others 'tis a passion and your team to you is the greatest team of all."

What do you see in it?
Why not watch another sport

Well let me answer that my friend
And put your mind at rest
I love the beautiful game
Because it's simply the best
No other sport is as exciting
No other comes anywhere near
Football can create passion
And lots of atmosphere
It is loved all around the world
Most children kick a football
Rich kids, and poor kids
small kids, and some very tall
A good football match is a joy to watch
That's why thousands go to every game
When you get goals and lots of action
All the fans are so glad that they came
So yes my friend I do love football
It's by far the number one sport for me
So while you're watching Golf and Cricket
I'll be watching Match of the Day, or Man U F.C."

When men in the pub talk football as they enjoy their beer
And look forward to September when one club will fly the winner's flag
The team that wins the Premiership gives their fans the right to brag.
Their wives nicknamed the footy widows their husbands at the football club
Or after work talking football with their mates down at the local pub
They take football so seriously 'tis their passion in life
The footy fan loves his football club as much as his children or his wife.
And if their team lose at the weekend they feel and look so sad
What's known as football addiction they seem to have it bad
They feel sad for their football team and the chance of four premiership points gone
But they cheer up and look forward to next weekend's game as the working week wears on.
This is the football Season football has gone to their head
And their football scarves and beanies they even wear to bed
About their team they feel so passionate as if to them it did belong
And 'tis with delight and pride in victory that they sing the club song."

says an expert
till the last seconds
That's about the present
world championship football
now still going on in Russia
Thinking of the match of yesterday
Japan thinks it wins from Belgium hurray!
this team will go to the Quarterfinal
But Japan became inassertive
Belgium changes a tired player with a temporary one
it's all in the game, but Japan must still be assertive
in the last five seconds Japan's victory has gone
that Belgium's temporary player
had gained that victory, now he has become a top player
Belgium goes to the quarterfinal
utmost glee because of this
most specially exceptional
That's why being alert will not suffice
being assertive is the only option all there is
five whole seconds before the signal of the umpire
a temporary player has set the Belgium team on fire!
with 3-2 they may still stay in the Russia sans wire.

=====================================
ADDITION:
Japan VS Belgium 2-3 Victory for the Belgium Team.
IF I may SAY: The Team of Japan must still be attentive, be alert and especially BE ASSERTIVE. Japan must still keep attacking the Belgian goal and must still have that behaviour as in WW II, aggressive and
all. They lost because of their own fault, it looked like they were awaiting the end signal of the umpire. YES, I have watched them too,
otherwise I could not create this poem and tell you all these here as my Notes. BE ASSERTIVE and BE ACTIVE, WATCH and OBSERVE CONSTANTLY, till the final signal of the umpire.

He screams when they fumble a pass.

I want to quit i do
but I'm not quite done
I was okay not tall at all
Now that could change
But to rise I'd have to fall
If i stop i cant start
If i start i cant start
I'm still at the bottom
Oh so far from the top
If i quit now
I can't start again
I'll fall far behind
There's no way I'll win
But if i keep going
My grades will slip
And its not even fun
So i have to get a grip
Well whether i play
or fall apart
Football will stay
Somewhere in my heart"
127,Emotion,FootballPoemsTheFootballMatchPoembyAnonymousAmericas,"I.
O wild kaleidoscopic panorama of jaculatory arms and legs.
The twisting, twining, turning, tussling, throwing, thrusting,
throttling, tugging, thumping, the tightening thews.
The tearing of tangled trousers, the jut of giant calves protuberant.
The wriggleness, the wormlike, snaky movement and life of it;
The insertion of strong men in the mud, the wallowing, the stamping with thick shoes;
The rowdyism, and élan, the slugging and scraping, the cowboy Homeric ferocity.
(Ah, well kicked, red legs! Hit her up, you muddy little hero, you!)
The bleeding noses, the shins, the knuckles abraded:
That's the way to make men! Go it, you border ruffians, I like ye.
II.
Only two sorts of men are any good, I wouldn't give a cotton hat for no other --
The Poet and the Plug Ugly. They are picturesque. O, but ain't they?
These college chaps, these bouncing fighters from M'Gill and Toronto,
Are all right. I must have a fighter, a bully, somewhat of a desperado;
Of course, I prefer them raw, uneducated, unspoiled by book rot;
I reckon these young fellows, these howling Kickapoos of the puddle, these boys,
Have been uneducated to an undemocratic and feudal-aristocratic extent;
Lord! how they can kick, though! Another man slugged there!
III.
Unnumbered festoons of pretty Canadian girls, I salute you;
Howl away, you non-playing encouragers of the kickers!
Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah, M'Gill!
Rah, Rah, Rah, Sis, Boom, Toronto! Lusty-throated give it!
O, wild, tumultuous, multitudinous shindy. Well, this is the boss;
This is worth coming twenty miles to see. Personally, I haven't had so much fun
since I was vaccinated.
I wonder if the Doctor spectates it. Here is something beyond his plesiosauri.
Pure physical glow and exultation this of abundantest muscle:
I wish John Sullivan were here.
IV.
O, the kicking, stamping, punching, the gore and the glory of battle!
Kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick.  Will you kick!
You kickers, scoop up the mud, steam plough the field,
Fall all over yourselves, squirm out! Look at that pile-driver of a full-back there!
Run, leg it, hang on to the ball; say, you big chump, don't you kill that little chap
When you are about it.
Well, I'd like to know what a touch down is, then?  Draw?
Where's your draw?
Yer lie!"
128,Emotion,FootballPoemsLifeIsLikeAFootballGamePoembyakachukwuchukwuemekaakabeks,"Life is like a football game
When you score a goal, you must play hard to defend it
And even harder to score more goals,
If you concede a goal,
You have to put all your energy to equalize
And score a winner.
If you score a goal and become complacent, your opponent
Will come from behind and give you a surprise…
If you lose hope because you conceded a goal,
Then you are a loser because you will concede more goals.
The spectators support tantamount the effort
you put in the game.
If you win the match, they become part of
The winning team,
If you lose, they will make do with the
Satisfaction of an entertaining game,
If you go down fighting,
They will always find a reason for your
Losing the game,
And to lose a match becomes a lesson on how to win next one.

The stands are full of eager fans
Who say, we're paid too much money!
But if they would put our suits on
They'd find football isn't funny.
Twenty-two men and five referees
Chasing a pigskin, air filled ball.
Mashing and bashing all the way
Till the striped shirts whistle their call.
All the generals on the sideline
Are waging their athletic war.
And the letters in the words they use
Never amount to more than four.
There's no substitute for winning
And no excuse for losing.
Though after games; when we can't sleep
It's because of all the bruising.

131,Emotion,FootballPoemsRugbyFootballHeroPoembyGertStrydom,"Drive men, drive!
Get the freaking ball!
That’s it, now go.
Fling it, throw the damned thing!
From the reserve bench
the game is rushing by
and both flanks, the centre, the lock
almost every member of the team
are taking huge knocks and still
nobody is really getting hurt.
A dropp goal soars through the poles,
followed by a brilliant try
and the crowd are standing, are cheering
when the confirmation kick
is delivered securely.
The opponents are really angry,
starts to play dirty,
with reckless foal play,
high tackling
and gets a penalty kick
that is on the mark
and then the lock is hurt,
trampled under boots
and the manager
points to me
and while the crowd cheers
I run on to the field.
The whistle blows
and in full pace I run in line
catching the ball that is flung to me
and the game is on,
the crowd roars while I sidestep
two tackles and see the line
and every thing is blurring
and time is fragmented
into splits of seconds
and I am flying at speed
trying to touch down."

Gripping all over
Fierce battles
Fittingly fought
Triumphant team
Winning accolades
Late night parties
Crowded countrymen
Celebrations galore
Shining south africa
Dazzling lighting
Quizzing questions
Is it day in night!

135,Emotion,FootballPoemsTheLoveOfFootballPoembyViolaAkhigbe,"I've often found it quite baffling
People’s immense love for a sport
That’s nothing more than ball handling
And a thunderous crowd of rare support.
Male and female, old and young
The spirit takes over their hearts and souls
Holding them captive, and quite overhung
Until the scoring of the goals.
Have you noticed the deserted streets
On a day a match is to be played?
Have you observed the loud drumbeats
That accompanies a team-win parade?
I ask myself, is this love or is this obsession?
Is this fan sell-out without discretion?
That a ball-engage in a ninety minute session
Would elicit from so many, such weighty expression.
Football binds the country, they're quick to say
Football is an antidote for dismay
Whether to watch or whether to play
Football reigns every day.
At this point, there’s nothing more that I can say
Other than pass the ball, and let us play
Football it is any day
Football it is all the way."
136,Emotion,FootballPoemsPlayingFootballInMyGraveyardPoembyRobertRorabeck,"Perfect on my imperfection, you fall:
I close my eyes but you are real, traveling
Effortlessly up your hills and then
Down,
Basking all the dogs, and their stones so
Round;
And I’ve made up these words to disavow you,
But you are not something I can take out to eat;
So you are real,
And I lie the last of my bouquets at your feet;
And my parents are so lonely after your passing;
It’s as if you’ve taken the last airplane,
But my grandmother lies unweeping the kinder
Weathers of her kind:
They are the kind that used to know you, but
Will know you no more,
And they are all the kind that I’ve been waiting for;
And you slip over my head like a child in
A dress;
And you go over the sea, and the women in their
Cars:
You go so far as to come around again
To watch me playing football in my graveyard."
137,Emotion,FootballPoems7On7FootballPoembyLukeEaster,"Memorial Day weekend, ESPN, I watched, “Outside The Lines, ”
And what I heard, well as the saying goes it just, “blew my mind, ”
High school kids desiring to advance & arrive at the college level,
However, there are those coaches who would bury it with a shovel.
7-on-7 football program is rapidly gaining popularity nationwide,
Okay now begs the question, what right has the NCAA to decide?
Former NFL great, Keyshawn Johnson sponsors & coaches teens,
By the way he doesn’t make any money but spends his own green.
How is it that people are in a huff about a day spent on a yacht?
To reward the kids for their efforts and enjoy what they have not?
Giving a sneak peak at what can be accomplished and the reward,
Should they reach the pinnacle of success and are able to afford.
Two Caucasian coaches speaking on OTL were one 100% against,
And should be obvious they grew up on the other side of the fence,
Whereas the majority of these teens are of African American decent,
Now with the high unemployment rate parents are just making rent.
How dare they or anybody come on camera, whine, moan & groan,
Because most of these kids will never qualify for any student loans,
Until they or anyone are willing to foot the bill, leave them alone,
Prejudice is not manifested in the locker room it begins at home.
Scholarships are the one and only way they will ever continue on,
How can any sanctioning body not involved declare it is wrong?
When a former standout wide receiver is willing to share his time,
What gives those who’ve never played a right to speak their mind?
It’s impossible to appreciate endless opportunities unless exposed,
As inner city Blacks, Hispanics & Whites the whole world knows,
Are like goldfish in their limited environment of one gallon bowls,
Till the big fish on the outside take time to tutor & help them grow.
So, when coaches steer them towards colleges they graduated from,
Would that not be better than not being recruited from a single one?
Or a school with unscrupulous characteristics and deceitful means?
No one alive has the right to prematurely squash God given dreams."
138,Emotion,FootballPoemsOnKoroits09FootballPremiershipPoembyFrancisDuggan,"They celebrate in the Commercial and Mickey Bourke's pub
The marvellous win of Koroit Saints Football Club
The Warrnambool Blues the pride of Warrnambool Town
In the Football Grand Final to the red and black went down
To the memory of such a victory Koroit fans will cling dear
They will celebrate well into next year
The Grand Final win to the Town has brought cheer
They do celebrate there in spirits and beer
From shop and house windows red and black balloons and bunters in the wind blow
Their great love of Koroit all koroitians do show
And well do they have reason to celebrate
Their present footballers with Koroit's best do rate
Their 09 Premiership for them a huge victory
Something that is destined to live in memory."
139,Emotion,FootballPoemsDoneWithFootballPoembyAaronFullbright,"as the years grow harder
so do the choices
should i listen to myself
or listen to the voices
for over three years
football's been my thing
i dealt with the failure
i pushed through the sting
but now im getting older
classes need attention
football should be done
but i twitch at the mention
football is a pain
it's losing what was fun
i want to quit i do
but im not quite done
i was the worst
no good at all
now that could change
but to rise id have to fall
if i stop i can't start
if i start i can't stop
im still at the bottom
oh so far from the top
if i quit now,
i can't start again
i'll fall far behind
there's no way ill win
but if i keep going
my grades may slip
and it's not even fun
so i have to get a grip
well whether i play
or i fall apart
football will stay
somewhere in my heart"
140,Emotion,FootballPoemsFootballFrenzyPoembyWalterreanSalley,"Football is a contact sport;
In short—a “rough” game.
It may leave you dancing,
Or it could leave you lame.
Armed with helmets, jerseys
And spandex tights—
All tough dudes,
Ready for the fight.
Digging in with spiked shoes,
And war paint on their face.
Staring down the adversary—
No mercy and no grace.
Tackles, hits and yard runs.
The scoring of “touchdowns, ”
With each team striving
For the coveted crown.
Whether dancing, banged or lame—
‘Tis the nature of the game.
And that’s okay with football fans,
They love it just the same."
141,Emotion,FootballPoemsRhymesOfFootballPoembyPradipChattopadhyay,"Net to net rolls the ball
with the feet fast they scroll
the kicks find the bar too small
too hard to score a goal!
Sweats it out the forward
saves it tough the one at back
like a fort he must guard
not allow a crack!
On the grass no guide or map
rely on footwork skill
pierce the defense find the gap
go for the lethal kill!
The ball if once finds the net
stop breath a million soul
mourns the side in sealed fate
the air is rend with GOAL! ! ! !"
142,Emotion,FootballPoemsHandOnFootballPoembyImaRyma,"The greatest football catch got caught
By Odell Beckham, rookie pro.
He had run down the field a lot
To try to catch a real long throw.
Interfered with in his pursuit,
He got his right hand to the ball,
And three fingered the ball in route,
Pulling it in as he did fall,
Stretched backwards landing on his back,
Inside the end zone and in bounds.
Odell's got quite a catching knack,
And results in a touchdown - zounds!
Odell ode is called for on it.
Oh heck - it deserves a sonnet."
143,Emotion,FootballPoemsLittleLeagueFootballPoembyABFaniki,"My little son plays football in a little league
his coordination is of a new born foal, his colleagues
on is almost the same as his
yet they score a lot of goals.
This amazing feat I never see in any league."
144,Emotion,FootballPoemsJackAndTheFootballPoembyImaRyma,"Cornhuskers college football game,
Fourth quarter and time almost out,
A 7 year old - Jack's his name,
Touch downed the hearts of all - no doubt!
The how and why of Jack then there
Was for the what was good for Jack.
Handed the ball, he ran through air,
Sixty nine yards, not looking back.
Sixty thousand fans, none dry eyed,
Watched Jack score and a win, welcome.
And Jack won hearts of all worldwide,
And Jack's feelings, 'It was awesome.'
Jack ran and scored, troubles behind,
His brain cancer not on his mind."
145,Emotion,FootballPoemsFootballPoembyANJANDEVROY,"I loved to play football,
That night I dreamt that
I was tirelessly running and running with the ball
To score a goal,
But in spite of my utmost effort,
I failed to score it again and again,
Finally when I succeeded to score the spectacular goal,
I found that I had already lost the match,
All my efforts were in vain."
146,Emotion,FootballPoemsFootballPoembyLindaOri,"Football is my favorite game
I love to watch them play -
Those tightly muscled butts and legs
On an awesome autumn day;
How fluidly and gracefully
They dance across the green -
Such elegant contenders play
The best I've ever seen;
Some people think I'm crazy
The way I love the game -
But I'd rather be watching football
Than anything I can name;
Of course I may be prejudiced
I love my maise and blue -
That BIG 10 team that rules the league.............
You rock the Big House - BLUE! ! !"
147,Emotion,FootballPoemsScoutsHonorThePopeTheFootballCoachPoembyLukeEaster,"Oh wow! Seems like every channel has the exact same story,
The most storybook football program has tarnished it’s glory,
At the Mighty Penn State where the winningest coach resides,
Amidst allegations of child sexual abuse the emotions runs high.
Did he or did he not, why wasn’t more done to help protect?
Those in a program designed to rise above hurt and neglect,
Started by an assistance coach whose job was the defense,
Not designed to recruit the adolescent under false pretense.
Joe Paterno has the most football wins by a college coach,
Supposedly his 2 national title program is above reproach,
But, just like the sex abuse scandal within the Boy Scouts,
Along with that powerful Catholic Church, better look out.
The names of the innocent victims abused are at least nine,
And amazingly over a known period of 12-15 years time,
Not through innuendo, hearsay or speculation it was seen,
Yet like the Catholic Church more important was the green.
Again dead presidents again took priority over child welfare,
Under those in authority whose main responsibility is to care,
One 60-year-old man naked with a likewise 10-year-old boy,
Alone it the shower on campus, like a toddler with a new toy.
To do whatever he willed over the child unable to fight back,
How many times before & since helpless when under attack?
But wait this time there’s an eyewitness of the dastardly deed,
Still it’s to no avail because in athletics the bottom line is greed.
Many who knew actually lied to the Grand Jury, okay let’s see,
High-ranking officials resigned & the president of the university?
As the nation ponders who is the next to beheaded by the axe?
Explain why the focus is on football not victims, what a sad fact.
So, should the man who passed the buck be allowed to coach?
Is not the Cardinal who overlooked mass rape now the Pope?
We need a real life Terminator to protect kids like John Connor,
Those who have Arnold’s role failed miserably, Scout’s Honor."

150,Emotion,FootballPoemsTheirFootballTeamToThemImportantPoembyFrancisDuggan,"Their flags and their banners they are waving with joy and excitement they shout
The hero has kicked the winning goal but what are they shouting about
To them it should not really matter 'tis only a game of football
But to them it is very important and their's is the best team of all.
At least that is how they do see it their lives revolves around their team
When their team win a huge boost to their egos and a loss bad for their self esteem
Last week their team lost in a thriller but their loss reduced them to tears
And tonight they will sing their Club song in the Local and celebrate with a few beers.
They look forward to the football Season and they live for the love of the game
And on their bedroom walls a poster sized photograph of their heroes and they know every player by name
Why do they take football so serious they talk about it at work every day
But suppose each of us have our own passions and each to their own one might say.
Their flags and their banners they are waving as proudly they sing their Club song
And they look forward to next weekend's game each day till then for them too long
Their football team to them important their lives revolve around the game
And each time their heroes are defeated the umpires for the loss they will blame."
151,Emotion,FootballPoemsTheFootballGamesOfYourTomorrowPoembyRobertRorabeck,"Kind of candlestick in the mud-
Hoary light in the swamp
Turning undone,
As the housewives moan like alley cats in their
Beds of predestination:
As they seem for awhile lost, pill bugs underneath
The covers,
As their pools glow altogether as if infected diamonds-
And their canals move slower
Filled to the brim with narcoleptic mermaids
And the fabershe cenotaphs of likeminded conquistadors:
See how the moon glowers over their
Strange visage swimming in the mud:
Each one with a candle undone just beneath the skim-
As the tadpoles dance
Innocent of what they will become,
And the minnows wander around aimlessly perhaps
Dreaming of the footballs games of your tomorrow."
152,Emotion,FootballPoemsYouAndIAndTwoFootballTeamsPoembyGroundSniper,"you and i
met not long ago

then the day came
you cheated on me
with the football team
what happened?
to you and i?
i didnt expect you to do this
i let my guard fall
and now as the open woulds bleed through
my heart cant take any more
but as the days go on without you
the wounds do not close
do not heal
my heart weakens more and more
then i heard
you slept with the visiting football team
the same night
as you slept with our home team
i cant take this anymore
you betrayed me
and our home football team
you slept with the visiting team
this is the final blow to my heart
as i walk into your house
i load my nine
i walk into your room
and look you in the eye
despite the other 3 men there
i empty my entire clip
into your slim tan body
i save one bullet
to end my hearts pain
the other 3 men
long gone now
i am now with you
and you are
with only me
we ended up together
yet again
just you and i"
153,Emotion,FootballPoemsFootballFansPoembyFrancisDuggan,"Of late little in our lives for to talk of at all
We can count ourselves lucky for to have football
For our after work get together in the local pub
For to talk of the fortunes of our favourite club
And discuss our team's chancesin the weekend game
Another win would bring themcloser to fame
This well may be their year for the Premiership flag
Would not this give us reason for to cheer and to brag
On Saturday our partners and wives at home watching t v
They do have their own favourite soapies to see
Whilst we cheer on our favourite team as they do play
It is each to their own as the wise one does say
A September flag win would be great for our self esteem
Without football to talk of we would be lost it does seem
Football to us a huge part of our lives
It gives us a break from the nagging of our partners and wives
Little of late for to talk of at all
Thanks be to goodness indeed for football
On Saturday the club colours we will proudly don
And go to the game for to cheer our team on."
154,Emotion,FootballPoemsFootballPoembyWalterreanSalley,"Bands playing familiar songs.
The majorettes with their batons.
Cheerleaders wowing the crowds on.
And cheering fans—old and young.
Illumining the broad field,
The lights shine clear and bright;
And from the tall, slender poles—
They glisten through the night.
Teams pitted against each other,
Gearing up for the game:
An American favorite pastime—
Football is the name."

156,Emotion,FootballPoemsAGameOfFootballPoembyJosephTRenaldi,"It is the first game of the football season
At most colleges and universities across the land.
Dedicated and loyal fans will enter the stadium
Thinking of a successful season beforehand.
Alumni and friends will tailgate before the game
Preparing food on their char-coal grills,
While the band assembles on an adjacent lot,
Anxious to enter the stadium to perform musical skills.
The visiting team dares to pose itself
In the stadium's path to all.
Prepared to tolerate the booing and jeering
As they enter the field to play football.
The field is fringed with supportive fans,
And loyalty and spirit are everywhere.
A quietude of anxious moments,
And confidence in the home team is in the air.
The band enters and struts on to the field,
Cheerleaders perform their acrobatic skills,
Alumni sit together in proximity to the gridiron
Reminiscing their collegiate days of glory and thrills.
Teams rush on to the grass covered turf
Amidst the roar of an enthusiastic crowd.
The visiting team clad in their school colors,
The home team in theirs and ever so proud.
The teams may be called Sun Devils or Wildcats,
But it makes no difference to the ardent fan.
They expect their favorite team to win,
And parade through the streets with streamers in hand.
Sometimes - defeat for the home team is inevitable.
The errors are many - the score high.
Imagine - the stadium's calming hush
As thoughts of a losing season passes by."

AMERICAN SOLDIER POEM
It’s not a priest that gives us our freedom of religion
And it’s not a reporter that gives us our freedom of voice.
It’s not any judge, lawyer, politician, or teacher
But the blood of a soldier that has sacrificed by choice.
Our soldiers line up to be remembered
As the best of the best at their job.
They wish to be needed and depended on
To save all we love from the mob.
They risk their life and limb for liberty
Standing firm against evil unwilling to break.
To be part of something greater than themselves
They are willing to sacrifice whatever it will take.

for all tackles u make,
divine is the feel,
for FOOTBALL is the game,
hell lot of energy,
but passion it demands,
to master the game,
& have its command,
There it goes, into the net,
with a slight li'l bend,
all celebrate, and u get it all,
what all you commend,
with all your strength,
you embrace the ball,
and your timely interception,
saves the GOAL! ! ! ! ! ,
completely exhausted of the effort,
yet, you make the run,
coz the feel of the BALL is gr8,
and feeling it is gr8 fun,
what all it means,
only, a fanatic understands,
no matter whether he is playing,
or is sitting in the stands,
Abhi plays Beckham,
Gopi is Carlos,
Rambo is Maradonna,
and on..., the feel goes...
we have it in our blood,
we have it in our soul,

They'd find football isn't funny.
Twenty-two men and five referees
Chasing a pigskin, air filled ball.
Mashing and bashing all the way
Till the striped shirts whistle their call.
All the generals on the sideline
Are waging their athletic war.
And the letters in the words they use
Never amount to more than four.
There's no substitute for winning
And no excuse for losing.
Though after games; when we can't sleep
It's because of all the bruising.

I told you that we the patriots will win the Superbowl of World Peace, but the sell of the Patriots winning the football game ''this year'' was the falsehood. Again I say, ''Selling falsehood doesn't stop truth from happening.'' - Joshua Aaron Guillory"
162,Emotion,FootballPoemsFootballPlayoffsPoembyCarolynBrunelle,"Dear God save me from my fate.
I’ve ravaged a whole plate of tacos,
wasn’t at all dainty or sweet;
I’m afraid the results won’t be discreet.
Crazy of me but it was getting late;
so I ate with gusto and zest
knowing later on it would
probably kill me at best.
Tonight it’s really hard to care.
I’m schlumped in my easy chair
ready to watch football playoffs
with a bottle of my favorite brew;
enjoy a much anticipated view.
I will most likely meet my justified end,
but, ahh-h-h, ………. what a way to go!"
163,Emotion,FootballPoemsFootballFieldEveningPoembyJohnAlexanderRossMcKellar,"Cross bars and posts, the echo of distant bells,
The cool and friendly scent of whispering turf;
And in the air a little wind that tells
Of moonlit waves beyond a murmuring surf.
The glittering blue and verdant afternoon
Has locked up all its colours, leaving dearth,
Deserted, underneath a careless moon,
The glory has departed from this earth.
The goals stand up on their appointed lines,
But all their worth has faded with the sun;
Unchallenged now I cross their strict confines;
The ball is gone, the game is lost and won.
I walk again where once I came to grief,
Crashing to earth, yet holding fast the ball,
Symbol of yet another True Belief,
The last but surely not the least of all:
To strain and struggle to the end of strength;
To lean on skill, not ask a gift of chance,
To win, or lose, and recognize at length
The game the thing; the rest, a circumstance.
And now the teams are vanished from the field,
But still an echo of their presence clings;
The moon discovers what the day concealed,
The gracefulness and grief of passing things.
Quick as the ball is thrown from hand to hand
And fleetly as the wing three-quarters run,
Swifter shall Time to his defences stand
And bring the fastest falling one by one,
Until the moon, that looked on Stonehenge ground
Before the stones, will rise and sink and set
Above this field, where also will be found
The relics of a mystery men forget."
164,Emotion,FootballPoemsFootballPoembyRebaHaapala,"Most of the boys on my team are ashamed that a girl is on their team.
They have a lot of question like: why do you play football. Are you a men or what?
Well here is your answer: I play football because I love the sport.
I can get out on the field and I can be my self and I don’t have to hide myself.
I’m not scared to be out there yeah I know most of them are bigger but I’m not scared.
We all have are weak point.
The world doesn’t stop just because I play football.
Go ahead and speak your mind.
There nothing you can say to make me quite something I love to do.
My sister wrote don’t be ashamed of your self be ashamed of the people that are ashamed of you.
Now stop asking me."
165,Emotion,FootballPoemsAFriendlyGameOfFootballPoembyEdwardGeorgeDyson,"We were challenged by The Dingoes - they're the pride of Squatter's Gap-
To a friendly game of football on the flat by Devil's Trap.
And we went along on horses, sworn to triumph in the game,
For the honour of Gyp's Diggings, and the glory of the same.
And we took the challenge with us. It was beautiful to see,
With its lovely curly letters, at its pretty filigree.
It was very gently worded, and it made us all feel good,
For it breathed the sweetest sentiments of peace and brotherhood.
We had Chang, and Trucker Hogan, and the man who licked The Plug,
Also Heggarty, and Hoolahan, and Peter Scott, the pug;
And we wore our knuckle-dusters, and we took a keg on tap
To our friendly game of football with The Dingoes at The Gap.
All the fellows came to meet us, and we spoke like brothers dear.
They'd a tip-dray full of tucker, and a waggon load of beer,
And some lint done up in bundles; so we reckoned there'd be fun
Ere our friendly game of football with the Dingo Club was done.
Their umpire was a homely man, a stranger to the push,
With a sweet, deceitful calmness, and a flavour of the bush.
He declared he didn't know the game, but promised on his oath
To see fair and square between the teams, or paralyse them both.
Then we bounced the ball and started, and for twenty minutes quite
We observed a proper courtesy and a heavenly sense of right,
But Fitzpatrick tipped McDougal in a handy patch of mud,
And the hero rose up, chewing dirt, and famishing for blood.
Simple Simonsen, the umpire, sorted out the happy pair,
And he found a pitch to suit them, and we left them fighting there;
But The Conqueror and Cop-Out met with cries of rage and pain,
And wild horses couldn't part those ancient enemies again.
So the umpire dragged them from the ruck, and pegged them off a patch,
And then gave his best attention to the slugging and the match.
You could hardly wish to come across a fairer-minded chap
For a friendly game of football than that umpire at The Gap.
In a while young Smith, and Henty, and Blue Ben, and Dick, and Blake,
Chose their partners from The Dingoes, and went pounding for the cake.
Timmy Hogan hit the umpire, and was promptly put to bed
'Neath the ammunition waggon, with a bolus on his head.
Feeling lonely-like, Magee took on a local star named Bent,
And four others started fighting to avoid an argument:
So Simonsen postponed the game, for fear some slight mishap
Might disturb the pleasant feeling then prevailing at The Gap.
Sixty seconds later twenty lively couples held the floor,
And the air was full of whiskers, and the grass was tinged with gore,
And the umpire kept good order in the interests of peace,
Whilst the people, to oblige him, sat severely on the p'lice.
Well, we fought the friendly game out, but I couldn't say who won;
We were all stretched out on shutters when the glorious day was done;
Both the constables had vanished; one was carried off to bunk,
And the umpire was exhausted, and the populace was drunk.
But we've written out a paper, with good Father Feeley's aid,
Breathing brotherly affection; and the challenge is conveyed
To the Dingo Club at Squatter's, and another friendly game
Will eventuate at this end, on the flat below the claim.
We have pressed The Gap to bring their central umpire if they can-
Here we honestly admire him as a fair and decent man-
And we're building on a pleasant time beside the Phoenix slums,
For The Giant feels he's got a call to plug him if he comes."
166,Emotion,FootballPoems969FootballAndWorldCupPoembyAmitBiswas,"I still remember those childhood days,
We could not go where the big brother plays,
But we had our tiny little niche,
Around the balconies, where maids wash the dish,
Round the year was our football season,
Much cheaper than cricket was the reason,
Did not have the boots to play with,
Bare-foot or pain was no reason to quit,
We did have our own competition,
Apart from fun and the strenuous lessons,
World cup was too far, had no knowledge,
Affluent always had over us an edge,
86’ was the first world cup I watched,
WOW the number of goals than Maradona notched,
But this time Chennaites may not be as lucky,
CAS for signal carrier has made our fate shaky.
CAS: Is Conditional Access System for the Pay Channels, which many households do not have.

167,Emotion,FootballPoemsAfterSchoolStreetFootballEighthGradePoembyDennisCooper,"Their jeans sparkled, cut off
way above the knee, and my
friends and I would watch them
from my porch, books of poems
lost in our laps, eyes wide as
tropical fish behind our glasses.
Their football flashed from hand
to hand, tennis shoes gripped
the asphalt, sweat's spotlight on
their strong backs. We would
dream of hugging them, and crouch
later in weird rooms, and come.
Once their ball fell our way
so two of them came over, hands
on their hips, asking us to
throw it to them, which Arthur did,
badly, and they chased it back.
One turned to yell, ""Thanks""
and we dreamed of his long
teeth in our necks. We
wanted them to wander over,
place deep wet underarms to
our lips, and then their white
asses, then those loud mouths.
One day one guy was very tired,
didn't move fast enough,
so a car hit him and he sprawled
fifty feet away, sexy, but he was
dead, blood like lipstick, then
those great boys stood together
on the sidewalk and we joined them,
mixing in like one big friendship
to the cops, who asked if we were,
and those boys were too sad to counter.
We'd known his name, Tim, and how
he'd turned to thank us nicely
but now he was under a sheet
anonymous as God, the big boys crying,
spitting words, and we stunned
like intellectuals get, our high
voices soft as the tinkling of a
chandelier on a ceiling too high to see."
168,Emotion,FootballPoemsTheHighwayOfAFootballPlayersBoredomPoembyRobertRorabeck,"In the retinue of
The carrion and paper airplanes
Contrived-
Careening forwards through the
Madness of
Dishonor-
The waves like the
Zygotes of misinformed poltergeists;
Until irretrievably other
Avenues
With friends and
Lights
Offering sweet fruits buttered with meats
At the doorsteps of
The wildfires of unresolved holidays-
Already smothered underfoot,
And carefully dishonored,
Blinded-
The diamonds of a unrequited
Nest,
Pilfered to the aeries of
Amnesiac stewardesses;
And in this way misplaced forever
Into the firmament of
Simulacrum and marionettes
Holding their breath futilely as she drives away
Without a second look down the highway
Of a football player’s boredom."
169,Emotion,FootballPoemsBaseballFootballFishingGolfPoembyTomZart,"BASEBALL
A game called prison ball was enjoyed in France
while English boys played rounder in short pants.
Town ball was the game that Americans played
While friends and family watched from the shade.
American baseball became alive
With Cartwright's rules of 1845.
Civil War soldiers played behind the lines
To help pass time and soothe troubled minds.
Professional baseball got its start
When the National League performed its part.
Soon after fans would pay to see the games
As the players traveled by boats and trains.
From April to October, players play.
Half the time at home and half away.
By thirty, it's time for most to retire
Before they're consumed by game time desire.
FOOTBALL
The stands are full of eager fans
Who say, we're paid too much money!
But if they would put our suits on
They'd find football isn't funny.
Twenty-two men and five referees
Chasing a pigskin, air filled ball.
Mashing and bashing all the way
Till the striped shirts whistle their call.
All the generals on the sideline
Are waging their athletic war.
And the letters in the words they use
Never amount to more than four.
There's no substitute for winning
And no excuse for losing.
Though after games; when we can't sleep
It's because of all the bruising.
BESIDES LOVE MEN NEED FISHING
Besides love men need fishing
And for both, most are wishing
Catching trophies chosen best
To be envied by the rest.
Fishing is a game of sport
Loved by all, both tall and short.
We must fool the fish’s eye
If we plan to stir and fry.
Some use boats while others wade
As they fish the sun or shade.
Ice-cold drinks help pass the day
While life’s troubles fade away.
Most men feel they've everything
With their rod, hook, cork and string.
Be it river, pond or lake
We all pray our line won't break.
GOLF
Many games were played with a stick and ball
As far back as the early days of man
Till the 14th century, golfers teed off
At St. Andrews, Scotland with clubs in hand.
Today men and women both play golf
As a group or just one or two.
Players, rich, poor, pro, or in between
Practice their swing with clubs, old and new.
They don't go thirsty cause they bring their own
Whatever it takes to enjoy the day.
Sometimes they play several games at once
As they win money or give it away.
There's nothing better than a green golf course
With the sweet scent of spring in the air.
To escape the drudgery of the workplace
Where you can laugh, joke, brag, gamble and swear.

170,Emotion,FootballPoemsFootballIsRoundPoembyLouisaDai,"A shooting ball is swooshing;
People in globe are watching.
On a sudden
Hails of cheers, vales of tears.
At losers' silence, winners're proud
Football is round.
In the humming of vuvuzel
Behind yellow and red card
All pass in the eyes of eagle
Nothing is impossible.
Football is round
For entertaining goal."
171,Emotion,FootballPoemsLikeFootballInVerseKeepTheBallPoembyEmmanuelGeorgeCefai,"Like football in verse keep the ball
Low on the ground, low, low, low.
Then in more than a language will
The meaning of the verse light.
And then the heavens will light –
And after reign of Night at Dawn."
172,Emotion,FootballPoemsFootballHisDiversionPoembyFrancisDuggan,"He is not getting on with his unhappy wife
His Football Club his diversion from his problems in life
He looks forward to the weekend through each working day
To cheer on his team such is life some do say.
He and his wife seem to have little in common at all
She does not have any interest in football
And their nineteen year old daughter is living elsewhere
Experiencing life in the big World out there.
With his mates in the pub football stories they share
A diversion for them from their every care
Than football no greater passion in their lives they can name
To them it is more far more than a game.
It would seem love in their marriage it is of the past
But then few things in life ever do seem to last
On saturday he barracks for his team whilst she
Is with her friend in the cafe enjoying afternoon tea."
173,Emotion,FootballPoemsElevenRulesOfFootballPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"I took my little boy
to  a nearby football pitch
He said he was tired
of playing hide and seek
He now wanted a football
to play around and kick
As he clutched my hand
I spoke to him
and tried to make him understand
the eleven rules of football
taking into consideration
that he was quite small
Now rule number one
Football is made of eleven strong men
When one or two are naughty
you may still get away
with playing nine or ten
Rule number two
When a member of your crew
hits the ball into the net
A goal is scored
that I can place a bet
For I am very sure
Rule number three
The maximum number of players
you can substitute is three
It does not cost a dime
It is totally free
Rule number four
There are rules you must comply with
When a team commits an offense
named a foul
before the game can commence
A small advantage has to be given
to the otherside
Rule number five
A freekick
is given after a foul
Sometimes awarded after
unnecessary dives
Rule number six
When you are shown a card that is yellow
Its time for your temper to mellow
or you will get the referee quite mad
and he will dismiss you with a red card
Rule number seven
A penality is like heaven
It is awarded
when a player breaks the rule
maybe by using his hand as a tool
to play the ball inside the penalty box
its time for him to go back to school
Rule number eight
A thrownin
Is when the ball is kicked out of the field
It's one of footballs favorite sins
Rule number nine
Offside is
When you are the only one running
alone to score a winning goal
you must hesitate
till you see a single soul
Rule number ten
A game lasts
for ninety minutes
You are beat
When your team has less goals than the other
That is when you must admit defeat
Rule number eleven
when your team is losing
you have to sing something amusing
saying
All we want is a goal
While we are dressed in coloured charcoal
Now my little boy
I said
These are the eleven rules of football
lets go and practise inside the sports hall

174,Emotion,FootballPoemsDanceAndFootballMatchPoembyKumarmaniMahakul,"Have you seen a football match?
In a field two goal-keepers' catch.
What do they catch and for why?
They catch ball for non-goal, bye.
Have you watched dance in ground?
Make cheerful players spend pound.
In round dancers come, dance enjoy,
Football world cup fills all with joy.
It takes place among two teams,
Team has eleven players' beams.
Around the field players do stand,
Goal posts are two each side bland.
A referee is there, makes them play,
He blows whistle when finds a clay.
Player to player does pass the ball,
Co-operations vanish atrocities all.
Players run referee does dance, act
Ball dances in sky and ground fact.
Spectators dance and run in cheer,
They say hip- hip hurray in a gear.
Scorer scores the ball for a goal,
Certain aim and effort reach to goal.
Hard labour doesn't go in vain,
Laborious parties win and gain.
Spectators cheer and enjoy the game,
They get affection, fraternity and fame.
Love, nonviolence develop among them,
Players maintain health in this game."
175,Emotion,FootballPoemsSports1FootballFever2018PoembyDrGeetaRadhakrishnaMenon,"Strike the ball in speedy split seconds,
Snap and chase the ball like life's only chance,
Get the ball in space defying moments,
Grab the goal like a miraculous dance.
Mbappe, the new football sensation,
Magnificent kid, just nineteen years,
Most expensive teenage player of France,
Motivating his fans with a display of skills.
A race for the world cup
Argentina's Lionel Messi
And Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo,
Alas! Make their shocking exit!
Cavani of Uruguay crushes Ronaldo's dream run,
Chasing the ball at full throttle, with
Charming demeanour of a Ferrari,
Changing the tide of the football fever!
Game of forward motion - kick and score,
Game of vibrant commotion - quick and active,
Game of constant evolution - lively and exciting.
Game of joyful promotion - cheerful and delightful."
176,Emotion,FootballPoemsHerFootballGamePoembyRandyMcClave,"I told her that her two teams weren't playing
She said those were lies that I was saying,
Her ex had told her that the game was on today
As so did another friend of hers did say.
I showed and I again told her that there was no game
Again and again that statement I did truthfully proclaim,
But, my words she did not want to believe
Which broke my heart and made me sad and grieve.
I told her that we could watch another game here
She said ""NO! "" she'll watch with a friend and a beer,
So, I drove her to her friends house to watch the event
I watched the game alone at my house, while she was absent.
I guess in her mind I was the visiting team
As in my thoughts and her actions that is truly how it did seem,
That was for certain my final and truthful analysis
Sadly, the home town advantage was all of his.
She stayed at her male friend's house for a couple hours
While alone watching the game I wanted that time to be ours,
She then admitted to me that her two teams never played
So, instead at her friends she got laid.

177,Emotion,FootballPoemsFootballKhelowarPoembyJasimuddin,"আমাদের মেসে ইমদাদ হক ফুটবল খেলোয়াড়,
হাতে পায়ে মুখে শত আঘাতের ক্ষতে খ্যাতি লেখা তার।
সন্ধ্যা বেলায় দেখিবে তাহারে পটি বাঁধি পায়ে হাতে,
মালিশ মাখিছে প্রতি গিঠে গিঠে কাত হয়ে বিছানাতে।
মেসের চাকর হয় লবেজান সেঁক দিতে ভাঙ্গা হাড়ে,
সারা রাত শুধু ছটফট করে কেঁদে কেঁদে ডাক ছাড়ে।
আমরা তো ভাবি ছমাসের তরে পঙ্গু সে হল হায়,
ফুটবল-টিমে বল লয়ে কভু দেখিতে পাব না তায়।
প্রভাত বেলায় খবর লইতে ছুটে যাই তার ঘরে,
বিছানা তাহার শূন্য পড়িয়া ভাঙা খাটিয়ার পরে।
টেবিলের পরে ছোট বড় যত মালিশের শিশিগুলি,
উপহাস যেন করিতেছে মোরে ছিপি- পরা দাঁত তুলি।
সন্ধ্যা বেলায় খেলার মাঠেতে চেয়ে দেখি বিস্ময়ে,
মোদের মেসের ইমদাদ হক আগে ছোটে বল লয়ে!
বাপ পায়ে বল ড্রিবলিং করে ডান পায়ে মারে ঠেলা,
ভাঙা কয়খানা হাতে পায়ে তার বজ্র করিছে খেলা।
চালাও চালাও আরও আগে যাও বাতাসের মত ধাও,
মারো জোরে মারো- গোলের ভেতরে বলেরে ছুঁড়িয়া দাও।
গোল-গোল-গোল, চারিদিক হতে ওঠে কোলাহলকল,
জীবনের পণ, মরণের পণ, সব বাঁধা, পায়ে দল।
গোল-গোল-গোল-মোদের মেসের ইমদাদ হক কাজি,
ভাঙা দুটি পায়ে জয়ের ভাগ্য লুটিয়া আনিল আজি।
দর্শকদল ফিরিয়া চলেছে মহা-কলবর করে,
ইমদাদ হক খোড়াতে খোড়াতে আসে যে মেসের ঘরে।
মেসের চাকর হয়রান হয় পায়েতে মালিশ মাখি,
বে-ঘুম রাত্র কেটে যায় তার চীৎকার করি ডাকি।
সকালে সকালে দৈনিক খুলি মহা-আনন্দে পড়ে,
ইমদাদ হক কাল যা খেলেছে কমই তা নজরে পড়ে।"
178,Emotion,FootballPoemsASoldierAboveTheFootballFieldPoembyRoseAnnVShawiak,"Never cared much about football, even less about
the Cardinals.
Pat Tillman rose above the football field, reached
out and touched our lives with his love.
Pat's heart encircled all Americans as he went
overseas to fight for our freedom and continued
safety.
To hear of his death this morning was devastating,
I can't imagine what his family is feeling.
Hopefully, this poem holds some of what Pat meant
to all of us."
179,Emotion,FootballPoemsThe2018FootballSoccerWorldCupInRussiaPoembyHebertLogerie,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia was a terrific event.
Thirty two teams came together to celebrate sportsmanship,
Of course, there were a few tackles, yellow and red cards. Ships,
Planes and busses full of fans, (I am kidding) , came under the tent
Of brotherhood to compete under the flag of their respective country.
Gotcha! Check the statistics to find out how many countries have competed.
I'm not going to do your assignment for you tonight. The fans were elated,
When there was a goal, even though the penalty shootouts weren't funny;
Especially, when your team got lost. The big headlines were Mexico beat Germany,
On the first round. Italy and the USA did not qualify. Brazil got beat by Belgium.
Argentina, Spain, Senegal, Japan and many others got lost.Bring the beer, the rum,
The wine and the pretzels to celebrate. At the end, there were four countries left to play
In the stadium. In the finals, France beat Belgium, and England was defeated by Croatia.
For a month, we watched and enjoyed great football matches. Almost every day,
I was stationed at my television. That was a nice party, a wonderful gala.
I will never forget the best World Cup ever. Oh! I missed seeing Pele, the greatest
Football player ever, who is now seventy seven years old. That was the best
Time to be alive. The final game was on a Sunday; Croatia got beat by France.
The score was four goals against two goals. Vive la France! Vive la difference!
The players from both teams received medals, which were handed out by Putin,
The President of Russia and other dignitaries. The P.M. of Croatia, a gorgeous woman,
And Macron, the French President greeted the players and the coaching staff.
There was jubilation. Everybody had a great time. We had fun and we laughed.
That was the best football/soccer competition ever.
Hopefully, the Qatar World Cup, in 2022, will be better.

180,Emotion,FootballPoemsAnotherFootballSeasonPoembyFrancisDuggan,"Another Football Season has just commenced having said so just the same
A lot of hype and excitement about  a field game
For many from their life problems a relief of sorts
Suppose that's why the establishments created sports.
Some things do seem to change little from year to year
Of football fans discussing football one often does hear
They talk of their Club as if the Club they did own
'Tis from people like them that Football Clubs are grown.
They talk of team ratings and player stats and of last weekend's best on ground
And of who their team are due to play in the next round
And the forward with a goal for the taking who kicked a behind
Next week with the seconds a place he may not find.
Another Football Season commencing the barracker's wife
She does feel neglected but then such is life
He knows about Football and the words of the Club song
And his heart to the Club it does surely belong."

182,Emotion,FootballPoemsOnThe09AllIrelandFootballFinalPoembyFrancisDuggan,"For the Cork Gaelic Footballers another humbling defeat
By their neighbours Kerry in Croke Park once more they've been beat
In Gaelic Football in Ireland Kerry to the fore
With 36 All Ireland titles and their fans hoping for more.
My mum was from Kerry that I cannot deny
But why it aches me when Cork lose a big game I do wonder why?
Though long absent from Ireland a sense of parochialism I do retain
Some-things from our past always with us do remain.
But Kerry fans with their 09 All Ireland victory need not get carried away
As their hurlers are quite poor though that does seem a sad thing for to have to say
Like Kilkenny Ireland's premier hurling County Kerry G A A rankings low
The lowest even in Munster as all G A A fans do know.
For the Liam Mcarthy Cup Kerry Hurlers never allowed for to play
For that not deemed to be good enough by the administrators of the G A  A
Like the Kilkenny Footballers Kerry Hurlers amongst the lowly rate
Though their many Football victories their fans have to celebrate.
Kerry are 09 All Ireland  Senior Football Champions their neighbours Cork they did outplay
In Croke Park in Dublin Ireland on September's third sunday
But Cork the only winners of the Hurling and Football double for them an amazing feat
With Ireland best Football and Hurling Counties at the highest level do compete."
183,Emotion,FootballPoemsTheFootballJockAndTheCheerleaderPoembylouisrams,"Football jocks- they allow nothing to get in their way
Girls hearts they’d break every day.
What is a heart? But tissue and mass.
They’ll get over it, it will pass.
Life is a game and we play it to our best
If girls can’t cope then give it a rest.
Love is like football and it has
many tactics that we must learn
and along the way people get burned.
They tend to dropp their hearts
and it shatters on the ground
But someone will pick up the pieces
Whatever could be found.
We are the jocks with one goal in mind
“ to win” every turn and every time.
We are the cheerleaders of the team
We get the fans to jump and scream.
We give you guys moral support
With out us your fans would abort.
You think because you’re  football jocks
That all the women s clocks must stop.
Well! We have a surprise for you
Without us you wouldn’t know what to do.
As for our hearts shattering on the ground
My friend! You better turn and look around.
You see!    LOVE IS NOT!    A football game
And no heart remains the same
You are about to get your dues
For we know exactly what to do.
You may be great on the football field
But our hearts, you will not steal.

184,Emotion,FootballPoemsHighSchoolFootballPoembyHansOstrom,"We stuffed our crotches into hometown pants.
Clacked on concrete out to mud and grass.
Hit each other.  Bled.  Got dizzy.
Sweat, got knocked down, got up,
got down, puked, hit each other, bled.
We were having fun.
I swear reasons existed then
for playing.  Honest I swear
there was a girl on the goal line
promising a slow dance.  A referee
waited to whistle me into manhood.
We were not good.
Often we had to buy the ball back
from the other team.  Once were down
forty points before the game began.
Our coach sold real estate at half-time.
Our cheerleaders hung us in effigy.
We pounded each other
until no one was left on either team.
The pads and helmets and shoes
went on grunting and blocking and tackling.
Fans stayed to see which set
of equipment would win.
We could hear that Homecoming crowd
roaring in the stadium
as we loaded the cars.  We drove
to the bus station, took
the midnight express out of there."
185,Emotion,FootballPoemsMudFootballPoembyStephenDeMarino,"After dividing ourselves
And having dressed
In near angelic whiteness
Do we stroll upon the field
We shout our guttural cries
Ritual insults as required
By the customs of the game
The we gather to our respective sides
And with a kick of pigskin
We are off
Flurries of muck
Marking our trails
As we enthusastically charge
Throwing ourselves into fray
Bodies collide and fall
Sliding through the ooze
That we play upon
No one keeps score
For victory is not our aim
Merely to enjoy the day
Embracing each other at the end
Since no matter what went before
We are all the same color now
Having acheived a muddy equality

You can

can shoot it you can drop it
you can stop it - just

187,Emotion,FootballPoemsFootballStrikeLimerickPoembyJuanOlivarez,"He thought he had lost all his reason,
Cause a strike threatened the football season.

Nothing Roger Goodell said, was as pleasing.

He only knew when his beer was due for a call"
189,Emotion,FootballPoemsInTheLocalFootballOvalPoembyFrancisDuggan,"In the floodlight lit football oval each weeknight after tea
I hear the young men shouting as they train diligently
As their coach puts them through their training drills their exuberance I hear
They sprint about in the chill night air in the coldest time of year.
Some of the young players under twenty they have their dreams of fame
That they yet may become famous in Australia's only indigenous game
To play in an Australian Football League Grand final would be a dream come true
A dream that's dreamt by many and realized by only a few.
In the well lit football oval they kick ball and sprint around
And in their endeavour to become match fit they cover miles of ground
And they perform push ups and pull ups and natural muscle in this way they gain
For one cannot expect sporting success if for success you do not train.
In the local football oval where dreams are born and die
The shoutings of the young men echoes to the starry sky
In the chill evening air of late Autumn you hear them cheer and shout
As they race through the oval and chase the ball about.
I hear them every evening from six thirty till after eight
In the local football oval five hundred metres from my front gate
The town's young budding football stars not quite yet in their prime
And they dream of sporting greatness that will withstand the test of time."

191,Emotion,FootballPoemsButterfliesAndFootballPoembyAnitaAtina,"On a sunny day, that warmed the winter breeze
Running with laughter and children,
With butterflies flitting o’er bobbing heads,
Coyly swaying grass,
Smiling up to clear blue skies!
Little sparrows twitter startled,
From their gentle snooze in the shadows.
Happy shouts play pass, with stomping feet
Arms waving, jumping
This way, this way! And goallll! ! !"
192,Emotion,FootballPoemsFootballGladiatorsLyricPoetryPoembyChristineAKysely,"Gladiators of the numbered turf
Helmeted heads and padded limbs
22 soldiers on the field
No more, no less, at any time
All have stadiums they call their homes.
Swift of foot and quick of mind
A scoreboard keeps the points and time
Score points by one, two, three or six
By passes, runs, punts or kicks
Winning brings them glory.
Most mother's want their son's to play
When son's are born their father's start to say
Where and when their son will play
Parents eagerly await those cherished fall days
When Football  is in season.
Upright goal posts at either end
Each team starts with their own direction
Weekly successes bring winning seasons
Sometimes the coaching can be the reason
The final scores tell the stories.
When January starts to draw near
The Championship games will soon be here
Fans are either elated or dismayed
To see if their teams get to play
and be this year's Gladiators in the Superbowl.

193,Emotion,FootballPoemsFootballSpiritPoembyChaseNacker,"Football is played with heart
There will always be someone better than you
It is like life, you can get knocked down but you’re the one to make the decision to get up
Everybody gets knocked down but it is your decision to get back up and fight back
Spirit is like pride and team is like family
Your family at home is there to help you just like your team
Big or small winning is the option you just need spirit
Emotions are part of the game and make you strive for gold
One day will be the last time for you to put on pads
I just witnessed seniors putting their pads on for the last time
It made me realize great things come to an end
Late in the years I know I could go to any of them because they are my second family"
194,Emotion,FootballPoemsTheFootballFieldPoembyZaidOkalMNSR,"The beauty of the golden days,
Where the great adventure began,
On a field where we all sang,
Sang cheerfully with our fans,
We were head on head,
We had a solid back,
A positioned middle
And a stronger front,
The score was one all,
The previous goals were jokes,
They were just shots without effect,
Hits without desire
We try scoring but fail,
They attack we defend,
We push hard but regret it at the end,
The match was too even that it couldn't be decided,
A substitution occurred,
Leaving us in shock,
Leaving us blank minded,
Leaving us distracted with our thoughts,
It seemed like nothing mattered anymore,
We are champions now forever more,
Not a single soul would be able to take it from us,
But oh how I was wrong about that,"
195,Emotion,FootballPoemsTheCrepesculeOfFootballGamesPoembyRobertRorabeck,"Transformed into
The petroglyphs
Before the songbirds who
Are out for no reason,
Dancing winged-
Songs stirred for the
Absence of housewives
With no more reason to
Love me;
The earth pushed a little,
Displaced from its godhoods
And toward catastrophe-
Dying a little the way the
Forest of angels
Drink sea salt- talk up
A little around
Graveyards- underneath power lines-
Why the sky is all blue
A little
F$cked up- punched in the face,
Like the crepuscule of football games
And I have nothing to
Remember how she feels
All asleep in his bed
While the ribald he rhyming burns-
And the roaming mouths of airplanes sing."
196,Emotion,FootballPoemsTisFootballPoembyFrancisDuggan,"'Tis football is the big World game of today
Grid Iron the big game of the U S of A,
Rugby League, Rugby Union and Aussie Rules Football
And soccer the biggest World game of them all
Gaelic Football a field game the Irish do play
Football in it's many codes the big World game of today
Football supporters Worldwide their team and their club colours wear
And in International games in their National colours they even dye their hair
Some men love their football team as much as their parents, children or wives
Yes football is one of the great loves of their lives
When their team does win the club song they do sing
But a loss to their weekend great sadness does bring
All over the World many codes of football
And to each their own code the best game of all."
197,Emotion,FootballPoemsFootballPoembyLouisJenkins,"I take the snap from the center, fake to the right, fade back...
I've got protection. I've got a receiver open downfield...
What the hell is this? This isn't a football, it's a shoe, a man's
brown leather oxford. A cousin to a football maybe, the same
skin, but not the same, a thing made for the earth, not the air.
I realize that this is a world where anything is possible and I
understand, also, that one often has to make do with what one
has. I have eaten pancakes, for instance, with that clear corn
syrup on them because there was no maple syrup and they
weren't very good. Well, anyway, this is different. (My man
downfield is waving his arms.) One has certain responsibilities,
one has to make choices. This isn't right and I'm not going
to throw it."
198,Emotion,FootballPoemsYouTreatMeLikeAFootballPoembyAsifAndalib,"I can’t forget those days baby
No I can't forget at all
When you used to love me madly
When I was only your doll!
You have loose character
I have known it later
It has driven me crazy
Baby I feel so lonely!
Baby I am not bad at all
But you treat me like a football
That’s why now I curse you
But I pray for you too!
Baby now I hate you
As much as I love you
You are like my favorite food
Baby I am not very good!"
199,Emotion,FootballPoemsFootballPoembyJoyceJohnsonMerryweather,"Just like a football I am and have
been bounced around a bit,
But only by chance of fate, no man
would get away with it.
The football suffers silently
the grabs, the throws, the kicks.
I'm not one to take that from
the country boobs or the city slicks.
I come from a line of strong women
who took on varying roles.
My grandma was a marcher
for equality at the poles.
Grandma raised her family of five
after her young husband died,
by sheer strong will and hard work
with no helpmeet by her side.
My paternal grandma must have been
a strong willed woman too.
She raised a very respectful son
who gave womenfolk their due.
My mama raised four strapping sons
without needing to raise a hand,
no slaps, no harsh words and no threats
to make them understand.
She passed down to her daughter
unrelenting self respect.
Rough handling me would surely bring
more grief than you'd expect.
So I'm not much like a football
nor would I ever be
an uncomplaining plaything
kicked around so endlessly."
200,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsTheDaysWhenWeWentSwimmingPoembyHenryLawson,"The breezes waved the silver grass,
Waist-high along the siding,
And to the creek we ne'er could pass
Three boys on bare-back riding;
Beneath the sheoaks in the bend
The waterhole was brimming -
Do you remember yet, old friend,
The times we 'went in swimming'?
The days we 'played the wag' from school -
Joys shared - and paid for singly -
The air was hot, the water cool -
And naked boys are kingly!
With mud for soap the sun to dry -
A well planned lie to stay us,
And dust well rubbed on neck and face
Lest cleanliness betray us.
And you'll remember farmer Kutz -
Though scarcely for his bounty -
He leased a forty-acre block,
And thought he owned the county;
A farmer of the old world school,
That grew men hard and grim in,
He drew his water from the pool
That we preferred to swim in.
And do you mind when down the creek
His angry way he wended,
A green-hide cartwhip in his hand
For our young backs intended?
Three naked boys upon the sand -
Half buried and half sunning -
Three startled boys without their clothes
Across the paddocks running.
We've had some scares, but we looked blank
When, resting there and chumming,
One glanced by chance upon the bank
And saw the farmer coming!
And home inmpressions linger yet
Of cups of sorrow brimming;
I hardly think that we'll forget
The last day we went swimming."
201,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsServiceInASentimentalSwimmingCesspoolPoembyJohnSensele,"In Utopia, fools in swimming pools
Fall in and out of love
Because love belongs to bulls
Whose motivation is self satisfaction far above
Any sacrifice, any price, any advice
Given or driven by relationship advisers
Whose task in a mask or flask twice or thrice
Consists of coordinated commotion which Texan trousers
Regard without any potential placard
As fully fruitless because players
Draw damsel dividends and shoo away any simcard
They misuse to become heart slayers
Once a chance for a glance or dance is over
For a fool in wool to feel cool
That he has conquered a lover with a clover
Service in a sentimental swimming cesspool."

205,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsSwimmingWithTheDarkQueenPoembyRICBASTASA,"how i wish to swim with the dark queen
how i like it that way
where i make the strokes, set aside the water with my hands
breathe,
and travel a distance,
wading throughall the liquids wrapping my body
the coldness and warmth all mixed up
the rhythm of the body sipping through
losing itself to a certain depth and coming out again triumphantly
experiencing little deaths and surging up to life again
i may pretend that i drown and i may resurrect myself with that big lie
and tell myself there is more to life than death
there is more to the struggle than simply lose myself in the depths of defeats and some uncertainties
Swim! Swim! Swim! Plunge yourself into the wates of Life
That is what my father too used to tell me once when he was alive
and so cruel and strict and unfeeling
and then i met you dark queen writing everything about swimming
how i wish to swim back to life again
and what i like most about it is that it can be done without so much talking."
206,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsSwimmingLessonPoembyDenisMartindale,"Some creatures learn to stand and walk,
Some learn to swim or fly,
Some creatures learn to sing and talk,
Yet rarely question why...
But swimming isn't easy, friends,
That's why some hesitate
And so, I guess, it all depends,
If water's what you hate...
The surface may look quite serene,
Who knows what's underneath?
No wonder some aren't really keen
When they come up to breathe...
Some creatures teach their young ones well,
To build their confidence,
While others simply want to yell,
As if that, too, makes sense...
While adults know their way around,
Their young ones aren't so wise,
They raise alarms at every sound,
Greet new things with surprise...
Swimming lessons should be sublime,
Not something you must force,
So, please, be patient! Give them time...
Let new things take their course...

Its procreative powers leeched away
Senile, rheumy eyed, a near-dead thing
Lolling in water, too far gone for motion

Its tiny lights like pin pricks, needling away the dark"

211,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsTheSwimmingSkeletonOfTheSingingWindChimesPoembyRobertRorabeck,"Clouds in asphalt, in the graffiti of sweet things,
Swinging their hips to the store to buy roses for
Themselves while the rain slings;
Oh, I’ve been singing out of school early again,
Watching the honeys picking up gas- I’m raggedy
In the brambles all my scars are browned bagged:
Every tender v is higher strung than I;
Oh, how sweet it is not to have to look one titted thing
In one venal eye; to enjoy the reasons of the gainfully
Unemployed- to fart in the litters of death’s convoy-
The reptilian monarchy knows better words,
Ruling forever their flamingoes’ soft conflagration,
The easy pantomime of frightening flight the housewives
Put to good use in their sororities satin-lined;
Areolas and suvs, runs in their pantyhose, gurgles from
The park swings; I drink whatever liquor I find stashed
Out back in the weeds beneath the clothes-line;
And I swing underneath the brindled palmettos-
I hook my arcs and curveballs far to the corner of where
The better girls have warmed to the infinitely better gentlemen,
Their children mewing like breast-fed kittens;
And I fart and tell jokes to shadows, my eyes ever present
To the swimming skeleton of the singing wind chimes."

And come to eat the fish of Wuchang.
Now I am swimming across the great Yangtze,
Looking afar to the open sky of Chu.
Let the wind blow and waves beat,
Better far than idly strolling in a courtyard.
Today I am at ease.

'Thus do things flow away!' '
Sails move with the wind.
Tortoise and Snake are still.
Great plans are afoot:
A bridge will fly to span the north and south,
Turning a deep chasm into a thoroughfare;
Walls of stone will stand upstream to the west
To hold back Wushan's clouds and rain
Till a smooth lake rises in the narrow gorges.
The mountain goddess if she is still there
Will marvel at a world so changed."

Nature has been recreated.

to be the real sea that is a few miles away.
Except for insecticide and chlorine there is
no aroma other than the smell of nothing.

In a chime of turbulence
Swimming back to the past
For the broad river back to early creek
Unfold the memories of past ages
In the album of experience, our old life
Reversing tears back to enter the eyes
Revisiting old smiles back on lips one more time
Wandering all before just before now
Still, we moving forward heading toward the future
Toward the estuary, swimming follow the flowing time
Moving back or in front, physical still here
Wandering, facing the stream only our mind
All good, bad now a past scenery along the time river
We heading to estuary to be as a part of wise ocean
Till time sending our final destiny to the sea
Another scenery of cry or happy we will feel and see
Just to move forward, forgive, learn to gain from past
Nothing to waste because time moves in any speed
So i will let my tears flow and smiles glow
Live these beautiful feelings in my life
For all time, as i know
Soon we will have no more
to hold each other (time and life)

The salmon are swimming up current to spawn
Of the Duhallow rivers as the flood does subside
The will to breed in them cannot be denied
Their lives are in danger at this time of year
As they run the gauntlet of the poachers gaff and spear
Some of them do die in the act of foul play
As victims of poachers which seems sad to say
And only the luckiest fish do survive
And make it back to the saltwater alive
From the predation of humans with luck on their side
In their spawning Season death they have defied
And will return to their birth river for to spawn next year
And run the gauntlet of the poachers gaff and spear."

And it is mine
Somewhere in its depth lies my beginning
A love that has no end
For this I must swim
Through the darkness of the waters
A light shines through
The beginning of something beautiful
But then it disappears
I feel alone and lost
But I keep swimming
It's been a lifetime of comes and goes
It slowly fades or vanishes suddenly
Or it was never really there at all
I could drown in the hurt
But I keep swimming
It is always different yet the same
Always beautiful
Same falling, same love, same end
Always an end
But with an end will come a beginning
One day I'll find my beginning with no end
So I just keep swimming"

(What maid will not the tale remember?)
To cross thy stream, broad Hellespont!
If, when the wintry tempest roar'd,
He sped to Hero, nothing loth,
And thus of old thy current pour'd,
Fair Venus! how I pity both!
For me, degenerate modern wretch,
Though in the genial month of May,
My dripping limbs I faintly stretch,
And think I've done a feat today.
But since he cross'd the rapid tide,
According to the doubtful story,
To woo, -- and -- Lord knows what beside,
And swam for Love, as I for Glory;
'Twere hard to say who fared the best:
Sad mortals! thus the gods still plague you!
He lost his labour, I my jest;
For he was drown'd, and I've the ague."

231,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsSwimmingFishPoembycherasserydamodaranbinish,"Clear glass like water
In it the swimming fish
Like the ideas........
Sometimes, it shows its beauty
And sometimes, its thorns.....
Sometimes, it goes into the abyss
And sometimes, it remains afloat.....
No wonder, no one can predict
Where this fish will go..?"
232,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsSwimmingForTheirVeryOwnOccupationPoembyRobertRorabeck,"And I took her to her first volleyball game
At my high school-
There she was,
Apiary- and brown honey at my arm:
And I wrote for her,
And swayed into her, like the moon’s sickle
From my front
Porch swing- until it didn’t have to
Pretend to be forever,
And yet it was beautiful- and from a long
Ways off threw up its arms
And headdresses and gave over all of its nations:
Into the sound of racecars
And adulterous housewives in the scrimshaw
And corrugations of the heavy metal of
Another trailer park-
While their pink breasted and younger cousins
Sunbathed and swam in the chlorine
Which attracted to them
With some small change at the bottom,
Correlating them to some form of giant goldfish
Swimming for their very own occupation
In the strangely shadow less moats of another’s
State fair."

234,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsSwimmingInSandPoembyDianeHine,"DRY
Noon's Saharan heat
sears the yellow fringe-toed sand skink.
Stinging simoom beats
sword dunes swept in serried bands.
Lizard's plunge is fleet,
swims beneath saltating tanned brink.
Sinusoidal whip's
subterranean dip.
WET
Should one chance to meet
supersaturated sand sinks,
Glide their surface sheets,
spread the body's weight, expand.
Stay unsettled feet,
float the span to countermand links.
Stirred suspensions grip,
skimmed solutions slip."
235,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsSwimmingPoembyCaseyNoe,"Swimming is fun
you can swim in the sun
Yes swimming is fun.
You can swim at night
Even though you may just
Need a little bit of light.
You can can swim with a friend
To keep a good trend
Just swim with a friend.
When you need help
Look for a lifeguard
They can always help.
Now go ahead go swimming
Go enjoy the water
Because swimming is fun."

where water sparkles as blue as the sky,
where some bikini clad girls draw the eye,
with skin tanned to mahogany brown,
where from a diving board people dive down,
where time gets wings and quickly rushes by.
There is a swimming pool in a small town
where water sparkles as blue as the sky,
where a myriad of beautiful girls daily lie,
where the garden is somewhat overgrown
and children buy sweets, chips and pie,
while teens frolic until the sun does die.
There is a swimming pool in a small town
where water sparkles as blue as the sky."

following protocols that are now non-existent,

Looking forward to edges of their pools, trying
to climb ashore and leave it all behind me once

241,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsLikeHousesAndTheirTinySwimmingPoolsPoembyRobertRorabeck,"I think that you should come upstairs
And drink with me,
Because there is nothing else the doctor can do:
You’ve already showed every young man in the regiment
Your tits:
The sun washed you amidst the clay-figured wild flowers
Along the battlefield,
While planes flew and plummeted:
And the peacocks grew in the shady symmetry of what
Seemed to be rainbows,
Along the cut in the valley from which the mountains grew,
And there the cliff dwellings and the ceremonies
Of the perfected virgins who could become
Stewardesses underneath the ornaments of birds of prey;
And someone said there was just a little house off in the
Forest of your hair,
Back in the elegance of this unseemly painting;
And from it a bride rode over the creek and went to school.
The buses turned and returned and the sugar cane
Flumed. The green copper cannons rolled in, and the wind
Blew;
And the beautiful girls went and then returned to their
Little houses and their tiny swimming pools all of which was
Hidden from view."

246,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsIAmSwimmingAwayRevisedPoembyMargaretAliceSecond,"She lives in her own bubble - doing what she
deems best for her budding business - trying
to ignore things irking her into impatience -
yet resentment makes her ugly in expressions
of bitterness - invariably the cause is mother's
blithely yap-yap-yap way of talking
While everybody else just wants to get on with
their lives, drinking morning coffee in silence,
planning the day, ordering the workshop and
helping clients, while she has to face the one
who controls her with a hand of steel and she
has lost the will or ability to be friendly, to
Treat others with respect, no self-control left,
no good manners or etiquette, plain straight-
forward accusations and irrational actions to
put the blame on others - everybody else is
guilty except herself, she used this kind of
assistance once - now she pays eternally for
The privilege - a situation so negative in its
extreme I don't want to get caught in it, this
driving me about since I cannot drive myself,
this getting me involved so I can take over
from her - isn't working, I do not agree with
anything, there's nothing honest or
Real, nothing true or eternal in this - the
story changes to suit the protagonists and to
draw me in - but I am swimming away…"
247,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsBlackpearlWasPushedDownIntoTheSwimmingPoolPoembyNHIENNGUYENMD,"After having their breakfast, roaming cats played together
Some cats sat to rest while others washed their snouts with their paws
BlackPearl strolled happily around my swimming pool
While nightlight shone on flowing water surface.
Suddenly, he put his walk to a pause
He stooped and stretched out one paw as he looked down on the water.
The clear pool water became more and more inviting
He decided to have a drink to fill his stomach.
While he bent to lower his head, he exposed his rear end
Zebra came running fast and pushed him very hard into the pool.
BlackPearl swam and got out of the pool as quickly as he could
He immediately attacked Zebra because he knew who pushed him in
Fearfully, Zebra jumped over the pool fence to escape
But BlackPearl chased him closely from behind by flying over the fence.
Then two cats disappeared behind bushes
But one could hear the screaming and fighting.
Zebra returned a while later in slow motion
His posture appeared as if he felt regretting.
He sat without meowing or playing
His half-opened eyes cast a distant gaze at the sky.

248,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsSwimmingPoembyGLeiok,"The sand between my toes gave my standing ground;
I waded in the warm and shallow waters, soft and calm as the currentless sea.
A sudden wave plunged me into unassuming depths,
The ice cold water crept up my spine like a twining branch of thorns.
A sounding horn awoke me to the sight of a faraway ship on the infinite ocean;
A red rusted ship, who's trail of shattered water told me it was all there was..
How strange the sight of a life preserve accompanying its path as i pulled back.
The shore had been swept from under my feet to a call of more immediate urgency..
As the shards of waves carried my stillness with it
Towards the flat edge of the Earth."
249,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsSwimmingCrocodilesPoembyEmmanuelGeorgeCefai,"Lagoon of swimming crocodiles
but
as tiny as sperm
glowing as yet
as the night stars that fell
on the sea's bosom.
owls that flew
through red boughs
and olive leaves
that was the sub-conscious
that was transformations
galore
that was dreaming
that was living
the other coin of life
the living"
250,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsTheSalmonAreSwimmingUpriverPoembyFrancisDuggan,"The salmon are swimming upriver in the cold gray damp of the dawn
To the gravel beds of the rapids to dig out their spawning beds to spawn
November is their breeding season in the cold and wet Northern Fall
When yesterday's flood is subsiding they are answering to Nature's call.
The salmon are swimming upriver by Nature they are duty bound
They jump waterfalls on their journey to get to their high breeding ground
Their urge for to breed is upon them their numbers they must multiply
To insure the survival of their species their natural urges they cannot deny.
The salmon are swimming against the current a hundred kilometres or more
To the high gravel beds of the river that journey to the Atlantic shore
They risk the gaff and spear of the poacher so that their species will survive
And the main reason for their survival is their natural sexual drive.
The salmon upriver are swimming with the chill of late Fall in the air
Through old fields and along by hedgerows by cold winds of their foliage stripped bare
They swim on against the strong currents without even one thought of fear
Of the fate that might even await them death by the poacher's gaff or spear"
251,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsSwimmingEachStrokePoembyLindaWinchell,"A Swimmer swims one stroke at a time
Focusing all ones energy, on the finish line.
They try so hard, to keep up the pace
Eyes affixed only, on just winning the race.
God sees us swim as we stroke along
Through every prayer, we pray.
To start our mornings and end our nights
He wouldn’t have it any other way.
To focus on Heavens’ finish line
To walk the walk
Trying not to lag behind.
But if you do and seem to fall short
God is there for you
To help steer us back on course."
252,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsSwimmingSunPoembyKumarmaniMahakul,"Freshly risen sun has shown face,
Swimming this is in sky's chest,
Swimming this is in water's chest,
No rest, no rest, this is swimming,
Creating its mirror images in pond,
Empowering every moment of love,
With its golden crown and pearls,
Sun is swimming towards Earth,
Welcoming and embracing tightly,
The pond shore grass is smiling,
Beside the flyover, near the city,
Smiling sun's swimming is reflected,
Nature's bountiful moment is counted,
Beauty's glance is justified more,
Palace inside water has whispered,
Golden ducks are swimming in joy,
No rest, no rest, fest is celebrated,
Compassionate heart is empowered,
God's grace through sun has entered,
Mother Earth's bosom is filled in milk,
For suckling the baby golden ducks,
Green juice is prepared for sun by leaves,
After swimming more from dawn to dusk,
Sun will be tired near dusk to rest,
Dawn's nectar is ready to serve freshly,
Swimming sun is thinking to smile again.

253,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsSwimmingPoolPoembyAkhtarJawad,"Be patient in the heat strokes sweetheart,
There is a shy rose hidden in the thwart,
Get up throw the clothes wear a swimming suit,
Go to a swimming pool be a little more smart,
Clouds have started rising to watch your beauty,
They should, your body is a nature's work of art,
Soon they will calm down the hostile sun,
May be angry at the moment my great Lord Bart,
Love will calm down the prince of of the skies,
Cupid has stretched his bow just wait for the dart,
Thwarts will be pinned down the rose will dance,
With thunders and lightning it plays its part,
Soon the sun will runaway all praise to the clouds,
Its face is already pale if not full at least a quart,
At the pool I see violets, jasmines and daffodils,
In a green sari my South Asian rose what a sart!
The naughty rains have started, will not spare her,
You are exposed enough if not fully sweetheart.
I am missing something, yes I am missing something,
At a swimming pool I have lost my romantic heart."

257,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsAMatterOfSwimmingAgainstTheCurrentPoembyRameshTA,"Swimming against the current requires skill and practice;
If one is sent on a mission as representative of a novice,
It's like swimming on unknown water by saying something
Unknown to the inquirer who can't question anything further!
Knowing the situation, matter and forming an idea, one can
Deal with the new situation and return home by intelligence;
This is how a wise fellow can manage oneself against odd
Situation to the surprise of a novice who has sent one out!
A person of such an ability can survive anywhere in the world
Knowing unknown matter using general knowledge, presence of
Mind and common sense with the skill of some popular languages
To make all interesting by one's expression of matter new ever!
A poet is also a person of that calibre only as one cannot know
Till beginning of poem what one has to say and how one has to
Finish matter better for the interesting seeker of new knowledge
Until one has ended it well to the satisfaction of oneself and all!"

-he spoke sweetly
-love his eyes when I see
-his past and family
-in his words floating, flying
Trace of home-sickness
-nostalgic with sadness
-missing past and anxious
-melancholy flavoured
""Uncle's house was called ‘Fort'
-castle-like with gardens
-of fruits, all varied
-a river in centre
-and guest house and cellars
-animals young and old…
-for milk, wool and mohair
-and meat, ride and porter…""
Everything that he said
-even talk and actions
-were sort of familiar
-seemed to be mine as well
- ""Great were falls, autumns
-with the leaves gone, fallen
-and apples on trees…
-all set for breeze, wind…""
-and he was like a child

-and we were forbidden; had no right to catch them,
-the apples then swam in water of river…
-for neighbours and poorer…"""

I love it but feel
Afraid as it may not help
Me float any time to
Get me drowned.
But, I can't leave this addiction
And can't stick to it.
Perhaps, I'll stay at the
Same state unless I
Leave this habit."
261,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsSwimmingMyTomorrowsPoembyRobertRorabeck,"The ocean is so close to me,
As if this overpass were a cradle:
The earliest stars are like her eyes to me,
And her lips an offering ladle;
The waves, they leap so far towards me,
As if they were women standing feverishly from a bath,
And the clouds the curtains half torn down,
From the sky’s impassioned aftermath,
And in the mangrove where the turtles slow,
The roots of trees her knees at rest,
The fallen leaves her scattered memory,
Flowing waywardly in the torpid currents over spilling
In the sea,
Where she goes, the rivers lead,
Where she seeps, the current swallows,
In my eyes the closest memory, through jetsam’s intercostals,
The sands are moribund and slipping along her neck,
Her breasts the dunes and hillocks,
Seabirds flight upon her breasts, and bury thistles
In her navel,
I could listen to her all day, wantonly breathing beneath
The humid skyways,
But she would not lay her eyes to me, for they are lain
Upon the vessel which strokes full steam along her memory,
And the men who walk it are white and capital;
She foams as she wreathes, pushing the porpoises
Along their bow and stern, just like little children playing
In the tub, squeaking and clean,
I guess she’ll never learn,
That when I looked upon her so long ago,
I swallowed her most entirely, and now when she leaps
Away, naked and ephemeral, I am drowning naked in her
Swaying caesuras,
Hypnotized by the epiphany of her unclothed torso,
Which flips just like a dream in an underwater midway,
First in the thirsty sky, then in the salty stream,
Jaunting fast and shallow,
She can hardly remember who I was, but she is forever
Swimming my tomorrows."
262,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsSwimmingPoembyGajananMishra,"Do you know swimming
I am not asking as
I know you are alive
And by nature, you are a swimmer.
Now let me know
Whether you are swimming
Against the currents
And if yes, let me salute your strength."
263,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsWatchingSwimmingLessonsPoembyRoseAnnVShawiak,"Cold, blue water, shimmering and shining like broken ice
floating around with the morning breeze.
Many children learning how to swim, trying to follow
directions so they can move up to the next class which
is not too far from them in the pool.
Sitting in the morning-cooled sun, a gentle wind comes
along and freezes them.
Shivering on the side of the pool, shaking with the
breeze blowing on them, gladly jumping back into the
water when their instructor yells, 'Get back into the pool'."
264,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsSwimmingBomb2019PoembyAlexandraMotschmann,"I always believed
that the russian president
who achieved
so much in the present
would be a man
with huge intelligence
and a great human
making a difference,
but now I throw my hands in horror
and all my faith yields to sorrow
how can they build a nuclear reactor
swimming on a boat to the pole
and instead of being a protector
taking business as a destruction goal
why setting million lives in peril
just to get fossil fuels to use
where the waves might kill
by the natural abuse
what kind of weird driving element
in a money making hand
conclusion of this all
the brain is small
the greed is tall"
265,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsSwimmingPoembyGangadharannairPulingat,"Swimming for a healthy body
For a healthy mind
For a relaxation from problems
Swimming a beautiful experience.
To swim in the river
In the lake
Through the heavy flows
Skills to be learnt with care.
Swimming in the flood
That becomes more dangerous
In a river, overflowing water
Flood is having undercurrents.
To swim like a fish
Like a tortoise
More I liked in my childhood
But never could I achieve.
I have seen people drowned
Their corpse and the sad event
The family's hardships
Water where one must be careful.
An old man in my childhood
I have seen him swimming
In heavy flood and deep currents
Tied up empty coconuts his tool.
He was a strange and wonderful man
Having such an ability to swim
Whatever the depth and width of river
But he missed for ever
That too in such an accident he drowned."
266,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsSwimmingWithTheStarsPoembyRandyMcClave,"I saw myself a lake of stars
As I walked past the lake last night
They reminded me of a thousand burning cigars
As they seemed near, and were so very bright,
I watched them as they shone and glimmered
Then out of curiosity I tossed a stone into the lake
And then the stars they all shook and shimmered
As then to the shore came their quake,
Stars of thousands I could easily see
And they all were inside this small lake
They brought me joy and also glee
That one moment in time I will never forsake,
Just think that all the stars that were in the sky
Were now in this one small body of water
And the moon as well, she was nearby
As the mother is always close to her daughter,
So into the lake I went in for a swim
I then swam with the moon and all the stars
I did it without thinking as it was just a whim
And while in the lake, I swam towards mars.

267,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsWithEmmaAtTheLadiesOnlySwimmingPondOnHampsteadHeathPoembyLindaGregerson,"In payment for those mornings at the mirror while,
at her
expense, I’d started my late learning in Applied
French Braids, for all
the mornings afterward of Hush
and Just stand still,
to make some small amends for every reg-
iment-
ed bathtime and short-shrifted goodnight kiss,
I did as I was told for once,
gave up
my map, let Emma lead us through the woods
“by instinct,” as the drunkard knew
the natural
prince. We had no towels, we had
no “bathing costumes,” as the children’s novels
call them here, and I
am summer’s dullest hand at un-
premeditated moves. But when
the coppice of sheltering boxwood
disclosed its path and posted
rules, our wonted bows to seemliness seemed
poor excuse.
The ladies in their lumpy variety lay
on their public half-acre of lawn,
the water
lay in dappled shade, while Emma
in her underwear and I
in an ill-
fitting borrowed suit availed us of
the breast stroke and a modified
crawl.
She’s eight now. She will rather
die than do this in a year or two
and lobbies,
even as we swim, to be allowed to cut
her hair. I do, dear girl, I will
give up
this honey-colored metric of augmented
thirds, but not (shall we climb
on the raft
for a while?) not yet."
268,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsATimeForSwimmingPoembyJosephTRenaldi,"When the day becomes hot and hazy
And I become tired and lazy,
All I can do is keep on reneging,
For the vast lawn needs mowing,
And the vegetable garden needs hoeing,
And work must come before swimming.
It seems that the grass has grown taller
And I get an immediate urge to holler.
Why can't I forget this awful dreaming,
That I was always on the brink of sneezing,
And constantly plagued with episodes of wheezing,
Until soothing in the water with ease in breathing?
The sun seems to quiver and know
As I think of the old swimming hole,
I rest my aching body and keep reneging,
Of course my work I am not shirking,
But it's just too hot and humid for working,
It's about time to sneak out and go swimming.
I notice the sun in the azure sky beaming
And again I catch myself dreaming,
As the perspiration continues dripping,
But my tasks have me outsmarted,
And I plod along slowly and half - hearted,
Thinking of the old gang going dipping.
I face reality and refrain from dreaming
And seek relief from the humidity with meaning,
And go to the swimming hole that is brimming.
Life is too short to constantly worry,
So why should I continue to be in a hurry?
It's summer and a time for swimming."
269,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsSwimmingInTheFloodPoembyDavidMcLansky,"Oh Death I am a coward
You drink an old man’s blood
So ruthless in your power
You drown us in your flood.
You leave some lonely standing
Upon the shore of life;
My request (I’m not demanding)
Take me before my wife.
But to see her lonely weeping
O'er the shadow in my bier;
Oh Death I would curse heaven
In my agony, I fear."
270,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsSwimmingThroughAirPoembyJamesMcLain,"Light of spirit helps me soar

274,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsSwimmingRacePoembyPiasPoems,"Butterflies, Complete panic,
A thrill of excitement.
Watching the water, pure and clear,
A feeling of wanting, drilling through my mind.
The race is called, my first event,
I feel a shudder run up my spine.
Standing in a line with my competitors,
My new enemies.
I observe them,
Watch as they prepare themselves.
Standing on the blocks,
The eerie silence of the start.
I single beep and I'm flying,
Straight though the air,
And then splash, I'm in the water.
The smooth cool water is calming,
But now is not the time to be clam.
The chlorine sings my skin.
I break the surface,
Hear my friends cheering.
I put my head down and stroke,
Only four more laps.
The sound of water drills in my brain,
I turn my head to breathe, and see my competitor.
I gain speed slightly, adding to the tension.
I reach the wall and do my fastest turn,
I will not let her overtake me.
When I breathe I look up to see my team,
To see them screaming and cheering.
Their support makes me put in a little more effort.
Then it starts, that nagging in my lungs,
My legs start tiering.
I push harder, striving for the finish,
Sensing the fear of the girl in the lane next to me,
I gain speed. I relish the competition.
Ten meters, only 10 more,
I start thinking of the finish.
It only makes me want it more.
I slide into the wall and finish,
I watch as the timekeepers discuss my time.
As they tell me my time I feel a rush of pride,
A personal best.
I close my eyes and listen for the results.
They call them, from 3rd place to first,
Second. A rush of excitement and regret fills my body.
But who beat me?
I look around, spotting out the winner.
She looks so happy,
In my mind I think she won't be as glad next time.
I slip out of the pool in one smooth movement,
Walk back to my team with pride.
Receive the sarcastic comments from my friends,
And the constructive critocism my coach.
The as the adrenalin of the race dies down,
I hear my name being called for another race."

To search you dear God

You give without urging

Only I have to work to get.
Hopes swim here to connect
This vibrating mind tells
At least to get rays light
I swim in my thoughts daily.
I swim for you only in love
To get a bunch of affection
Hopes give me joy around
I remain happy with you."

277,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsRealSwimmingPoembyEdgarAlbertGuest,"I saw him in the distance, as the train went speeding by,
A shivery little fellow standing in the sun to dry.
And a little pile of clothing very near him I could see:
He was owner of a gladness that had once belonged to me.
I have shivered as he shivered, I have dried the way he dried,
I've stood naked in God's sunshine with my garments at my side;
And I thought as I beheld him, of the many weary men
Who would like to go in swimming as a little boy again.
I saw him scarce a moment, yet I knew his lips were blue
And I knew his teeth were chattering just as mine were wont to do;
And I knew his merry playmates in the pond were splashing still;
I could tell how much he envied all the boys that never chill;
And throughout that lonesome journey, I kept living o'er and o'er
The joys of going swimming when no bathing suits we wore;
I was with that little fellow, standing chattering in the sun;
I was sharing in his shivers and a partner of his fun.
Back to me there came the pictures that I never shall forget
When I dared not travel homewards if my shock of hair was wet,
When I did my brief undressing under fine and friendly trees
In the days before convention rigged us up in b.v.d's.
And I dived for stones and metal on the mill pond's muddy floor,
Then stood naked in the sunshine till my blood grew warm once more.
I was back again, a youngster, in those golden days of old,
When my teeth were wont to chatter and my lips were blue with cold."
278,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsSwimmingAgainstTheTidePoembyRoseAnnVShawiak,"Quickly anticipating melodies and their liveliness
as they grab and take me with them into realms of
a musical reality.
Watching rivers flow past, mind swimming against

and it's future.
Always watching, nothing interfering and all of
nature, human and otherwise, finds it's way in
exacting measures of musical interludes."
279,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsSwimmingWithASharkPoembyBernardSnyder,"She tried to warn me
right from the start,
she said she had a friend
that had stolen her heart,
even though I was warned from the very beginning
I liked her so much I kept right on swimming,
I know winning her over would be tough to do
so, when she gave me an opening
I slipped right through,
Now that I'm in
the water seemed to have gotten deeper,
I'm not so sure
that she's a real keeper,
I think she swims along
plays her part,
but she can't 'feel'
because she doesn't have a heart,
I've even thought about backing off
so, maybe she could find
the soulmate she'd lost,
but I also know that she really needs me
and swimming away from her
isn't quite so easy,
but so often I ask myself
what role do I play
am I just another 'fish'
or am I standing in the way,
I hate being confused from one day to the next,
feels like I'm tangled up
in a fisherman's net,
a part of me would like to leave
and get out of the dark
but there's the other side
thats madly in love with the shark"

across the water
where people float
and enjoy at the deepest place
the well-being that the pool
brings magically,
before we wrap our arms around each other
and recoil in the water up and down
and a few rascals
splashes us totally wet.
While we drink ginger ale
lying on our towels,
there’s a mom with two daughters
that pours some orange Fanta for them
and they throw blocks of ice
into the top of her swimsuit.
She shudders from the cold
and give small yells and say
half amused
“wait you are causing

until one steps on a bee
and the yells
gets a new intensity."

A fulfilment nothing can give in this world of uncertainty;
Love is the source for all remarkable things of great value
That are achieved by ambition inspired by love quite amazing!
To swim deep, it is like churning the milky ocean to get
Ambrosia for the long life of angel like humans in the world;
Cooperation of mutually interested souls only can take up
Such a great adventure to achieve the greatest joy unique!
Diving deep in the ocean of love, there is no fatigue or
Tiredness for the persons involved in such a love venture;
Will there be any end or failure for the players of love
Game in life that has no destination but only space journey!
Getting through the invisible slit it is possible to knock
The door of heaven leading to the milky ocean to churn to
Get the ambroisa of love that brings eternal pleasure born
Of passion lifting high to sublime state of bliss forever!"

‘You are a goblin should I take
Advice of you? ’
‘Depends on you, free are you’

Floating body, pressing water, moving forward
How nice to enjoy spattering, splashing sound!
Gesturing body, flapping wing, clapping hand,
I remember once while swimming with friend
To cross the local river to go to enjoy local band
Where we saw the singers sang hand in hand
In sweet voice, shaking body, hair, opening mind,
On the way home longitudinally in river we swam
All the while we gossiped and made lots of fun
Then we dove, caught fishes, late we returned home
Many happy did return in every sun and moon,
Now, we swim paying money in swimming pool
And in artificial lake without lily though waterful
But funless swimming, charmless time passing
Though it is a game here with heavy contesting.

For a silly, madcap, dare.
In the distance watched a figure.
With a look of, despair.
A man's grimacing eyes watched
Fishing on the far bank
As it happens my stepfather, crotched
Legged, looking point-blank.
Pole in hand; gazing above, the rod-tip.
30 minutes, swimming the lake
One-side, only, neither one enough equip?
We'd made a big mistake.
Sure enough his glances, like the water
We're deeper than, our despair.
Soon we'd have to walk back near naked nuder
Then if our underwear, were made of mohair!
But with my best friend walking by my side
I still felt unusually warm inside..."

Of which, one half is in full sun, another one half in shade.
I have cut grass and trimmed bushes the whole day.
It's a very hot summer day and sweats soaked my clothes
Water is very clear and water ripples are so inviting.
With open arms, I jump in the pool and swim continuously
There is an oak forest behind the pool.
Spring season just ended but oak leaves are still dark green.
The sun is about one half way on western sky
Its golden rays horizontally shine on cloud dogs.
Under warm, blue afternoon sky
Sad cries of a mourning dove came from afar.

295,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsSwimmingOutsideTheStreamOfYourDreamsPoembyJamesMcLain,"There have been so many like U.S.
Trying to get into your dream's.
Though unlike U.S.
those extraterrestrial races still alive
have evolved and managed to survive.
Crossing infinite bridge's, bridge's
built by those other's,
benevolent bridge's they built and then left.
I have long since theorized
due to humanities self destructive way's.
Drone's are by them all they will risk.
America has shone an affinity towards making
weapon's that can kill the whole world.
Having conquered disease and illiminated old age
they can sit back and watch U.S. on T.V.
Common since would dictate if we can't learn
from them
then there are only so many mistakes we have left.
While having more money you can't spend isn't
one of them.
Unadvised children and million's of abused adult's will
never endear them to U.S. and I don't
want to be exterminated by them because of your selfishness and greed.
Either we can evolve out into the stream the stream where
it's green the dream we can choose, it is real."

Your Heart dips its oars

I open my mouth like the fish

huge gulps.
I swirl inside the water-spout

in the quiet bliss
of our contentment.
Where in life does this ocean live-
it doesn't-it contains our life
yet itself is of an other existence.
We swim in it

298,Emotion,SwimmingPoemsTheLessonsOfSwimmingPoembyGangadharannairPulingat,"Every one can't swim in a river
Which experience makes some to swim
The swimming a perfect exercise
Mind and body rejuvenating
Every one destined to swim
Across the ocean of life
Which experience makes them to cross
The currents and depth in the way
Every life is entitled to swim
The life that requires so much vision
Some may drown in ways of currents
Some victorious and triumphant
Everything depends the individual
And surroundings he got the training."

Why settle for white sand when you can have a little color? Several places in the Caribbean have pink beaches, but the most iconic is on Harbour Island. The strawberry ice cream color comes from shells of microscopic marine organisms. The aptly-named Pink Sand Beach stretches most of the island's three-mile eastern shore, where sunrises are spectacular and an offshore coral reef tempers the surf."

And the great winds come and go,
And the steady breezes blow,
Bearing perfume, bearing love.
Breezes hasten, swallows fly,
Towered clouds forever ply,
And at noonday, you and I
See the same sunshine above.
Dew and rain fall everywhere,
Harvests ripen, flowers are fair,
And the whole round earth is bare
To the moonshine and the sun;
And the live air, fanned with wings,
Bright with breeze and sunshine, brings
Into contact distant things,
And makes all the countries one.
Let us wander where we will,
Something kindred greets us still;
Something seen on vale or hill
Falls familiar on the heart;
So, at scent or sound or sight,
Severed souls by day and night
Tremble with the same delight -
Tremble, half the world apart."

Doesn’t have to be potatoes and meat

Take yourself to another country

Let us seek the mountain land:’
So they called me, happy playmates,
And we left the dawn-lit strand:
Riding on till later sunbeams slanted
On dark hills and downward-plunging streams,
And the solemn forest softly chanted
Old, old dreams.
From the pass, we saw in glory
Wave on purple wave unrolled
To the cloud-encircled summit
Floating high, alone and cold:
Like that altar-stone, by men of Athens
Dedicated to the unknown God;
Waiting for some fire to touch his holy
White abode.
Then the mellow sunset dying
Passed in rosy fire away,
And the stars and planets journeyed
On their ancient unknown way.
Riders of the illimitable heaven!
Moving on so far beyond our ken,
Do ye scorn the toiling, heavy-hearted
Sons of men?
Ere we slept we heard the torrents
Rushing from that mighty hill
Join in deep melodious singing,
While the forest-land was still.
Music of forgotten wildernesses!
Would that I could hear that song again!
Song of primal Earth’s enchanted sweetness,
Joy and pain."

and how he finally caught a soul to save
You see he has this friend named Feathers
And Feathers won't be found at a sermon in any kind of weather
But Dodgy Dave the Vicar was up to his old tricks
He caught Feathers on a double quick
While Feathers was talking to some friends outside the church
The Vicar rolled his pulpit outside with a lurch
Handed Feathers one of the hymnal books
Then asked to commence without a look
Feathers looked around and said 'I hope no one has a camera here'
for capturing this milestone event was his fear
Well David just happened to have his Tele Tinkle camera phone
and a picture was captured of feathers receiving his fire and brimstone
Everyone said it was about time
that this old sod got religion in his prime
But the best part was yet to come
When the Mayor arrived late and was told what David had done
The Mayor said he already knew
He had heard it all over the car radio news
So there you have it another Dodgy Dave the Vicar Tale
On how he had a church service on such a small scale
Capturing his friend Feathers so all could retell

318,Emotion,TravelPoemsTravelStainedManPoembyFrancisDuggan,"The other day I met a tramp
His hair was wet, his clothes looked damp
The poor man seemed hungry and cold
He must have been sixty years old.
His wrinkled face showed signs of strain
In his right hand was a walking cane,
The memory with me will long remain
Of him walking in the cold November rain.
This slender man of snow white hair
With clothes that were the worst for wear
Greeted with a curt good day
And slowly plodded on his way.
To be frank and speak the truth
I pitied one so destitute
And though it may sound a little queer
I had to fight to choke a tear.
The Winter months are harsh and long
And this poor man did not seem strong
I wonder will he see the Spring
And hear again the blackbird sing? .
As I sleep in a comfortable bed
This man will sleep in a draughty shed
Inhabited by rats and mice
On hay and straw ridden with lice.
He's no self respect or pride,
All self respect in him has died,
He lives a life of poverty
And has to beg for charity.
He knows about degradation
About prejudice and discrimination
These he meet with every day
When well offs from him turn away.
But on his journeys he also meet
People who give him money and food to eat,
His type they can understand
And reach to him the helping hand
Vagabonds are born to roam
His kind seldom have been known
To take a job and settle down
They like to move from town to town.
I pitied him he looked so frail,
His wrinkled face so wan and pale
And though I hope I'm wrong it seems to me
That Spring time he won't live to see.
Time from my mind will not erase
The memory of the poor tramp's face
Who someday soon may be found dead
In a cold and draughty shed"

Sky was the roof of his home rent free
To move about was not his spree
Quest for moving yearning for a key!
Planets move along the fixed orbit
Sun and moon seem to move with grit
Birds and animals walk on earth quite fit
Skylark flies and floats well in the air
Duck and swan walk on earth
Swim in water free with mirth
Motivating the men to try
To swim in water and fly in the sky!
Ancient ones walked from place to place
Later learnt to move on horse's back with grace
Trees and plants stand and grow quite trim
Birds and all walk, fly or swim
Some walk and fly, few walk and swim
Man alone learnt all the three to the brim!
Cart and car on road
Train and tram on the track
Boat and ship on water
Copter and plane in air!
Quietly sit in the running train
Nicely see the moving trees!
Deceptive vision swept in the world
Creative mind captive in its fold!
Fly in the air amidst clouds alone
Go in the ship amidst water alone
Delight it is travel in a train
Twilight travel removes all your strain!
Enjoy the journey really fine
Life's journey full of pain and gain!
Dizzy hills and lovely dales
Tall trees and fertile fields
Dense forests and delightful deserts
Coconut groves and mango gardens
Mosque domes and temple towers
Church towers- a treat of showers!
Red rays of the rising sun
Golden rays of the dying sun!
Moving cars in the parallel tracks
Waving hands of the rural folks!
Outside the train all such treats
Inside the coach sure much sweets!
Young and old, fit and the sick
Men and women, poor and the rich
Slow and lazy, swift and the quick
Confluence of all with a goal
Goal of reaching their home!
Display of human frivolities
Gaining entry into the crowded coach
Blocking latter, closing the approach!
Selfish to the core from the days of yore
Giving less and taking more!
Good Samaritans surely found
Spreading cheers all around!
Sleeping well to the lullaby of the train
Reading full to fill the gap in the brain
Eating, munching kept in store
Vendors providing more and more
Talking topics all under the sun
Giving chance of reply sure to none!
Delight indeed is a train travel
Grand indeed is the modern marvel!"

tightly onto to its past treasuring

strength and inspiration whenever
she is lost in the sea of ideas, home
or abroad,  techno or cultures,
fashion, culinary, pop or arts that
tiptoe, waltz, jive,  foxtrot, tango, cha cha,
pirouette, twirl and swirl into Singaporeans' mind
the way they still call China Town
Ngu Chia Jui (Bullock Cart Water)
which invariably transports us back to those
years when life  was tough like a buffalo's
even water was not  easy to get
rationed, and distributed by Indian
workers who everyday came shouting
water water on bullock carts
Or the Samsui Cha Bo
(women with the red headgear)
solid and strong as granite amazons
who still bow and carry
the City of Lion on their backs
The city they too helped
build  up brick by brick, sweat and tears
Or the Tekka, Tekka (below the bamboos)
they still use to call the entrance to Little India
the bamboos are no more an icon there
but how can you forget such pristine
gifts of heaven, such auspicious growth metaphors?
Singapore that has inched and risen fast as  a
million bamboo shoots to wave in reflection of its humble roots?
Serangoon, Serangoon, Little India, Little India
Even Shah Rukh Khan and Asywara Rai love

And Kandang Kerbau  Women's

and you would hear cattle bleating
and Indians workers careering round your
young  smiling  pregnant  wives  or

or its namesake  for this  'Cattle Coop'

Arches National Park lives up to its name. Its salt bed base—called the ""Paradox Foundation""—has resulted in more than 2,000 natural sandstone arches and countless unusual rock formations. This gave Mother Nature a canvas to shape and form the arches, spires, fins, and monoliths."

Experience Caribbean history in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The capital city's 12-block Zona Colonial boasts the oldest cathedral, hospital, customs house, and university in the Americas. Visit the Alcázar de Colón, the palace built for Christopher Columbus's son Diego and his wife, King Ferdinand of Spain's niece. And at the Museo de las Casas Reales you'll find an array of colonial artifacts including weapons, armor, remnants of an 18th-century Spanish ship, and (allegedly)        some of Columbus's ashes."

And probably most we leave behind
We continue to walk ahead of us
New fresh roads we want to find
And sometimes we wonder
If we took the best road we could
If we could erase them and start over
We often think perhaps we would
Some roads we travel often though
Off and on throughout the years
They get worn and sad and weary
And we shed so many tears
But we try to put them behind us
And trudge bravely on ahead
Trying very heard to not look back
But find great new roads instead
So no matter where we’ve been
As our lives we continue to unravel
We all just try to do our best
With the many roads we travel!"

guide at the gallery uses torch light to show the spot you are actually at  in the city. It is nice to know that Singapore has several other airports apart from Chang, the rest for military purposes. The guide would also point out the large number of reservoirs in  Singapore needed to help the island republic become self sufficient in water. It is also interesting to note that much of present day Singapore city centre especially those near the harbour are built on reclaimed land."
331,Emotion,TravelPoemsTravelPoembyRobertLouisStevenson,"I should like to rise and go
Where the golden apples grow;--
Where below another sky
Parrot islands anchored lie,
And, watched by cockatoos and goats,
Lonely Crusoes building boats;--
Where in sunshine reaching out
Eastern cities, miles about,
Are with mosque and minaret
Among sandy gardens set,
And the rich goods from near and far
Hang for sale in the bazaar;--
Where the Great Wall round China goes,
And on one side the desert blows,
And with the voice and bell and drum,
Cities on the other hum;--
Where are forests hot as fire,
Wide as England, tall as a spire,
Full of apes and cocoa-nuts
And the negro hunters' huts;--
Where the knotty crocodile
Lies and blinks in the Nile,
And the red flamingo flies
Hunting fish before his eyes;--
Where in jungles near and far,
Man-devouring tigers are,
Lying close and giving ear
Lest the hunt be drawing near,
Or a comer-by be seen
Swinging in the palanquin;--
Where among the desert sands
Some deserted city stands,
All its children, sweep and prince,
Grown to manhood ages since,
Not a foot in street or house,
Not a stir of child or mouse,
And when kindly falls the night,
In all the town no spark of light.
There I'll come when I'm a man
With a camel caravan;
Light a fire in the gloom
Of some dusty dining-room;
See the pictures on the walls,
Heroes fights and festivals;
And in a corner find the toys
Of the old Egyptian boys."

some of which are tailored for Singapore. Here Singapore will also have its second casinos, owned by Resorts World International, a Malaysian company. About US44.2 billion was spent in developing the lands here, the size of 40 football fields put together. There will also be six themed hotels one of which is named after its designer Michael Graves, international shows and theatres. the surprising thing was as soon as we reached sentosa, we heard a blast.

And the day is loud with voices speaking,
Yet there isn't a train goes by all day
But I hear its whistle shrieking.
All night there isn't a train goes by,
Though the night is still for sleep and dreaming,
But I see its cinders red on the sky,
And hear its engine steaming.
My heart is warm with friends I make,
And better friends I'll not be knowing;
Yet there isn't a train I wouldn't take,
No matter where it's going."

losing her childhood love to another woman

low thunder under all passengers
Steel sounds tripping and tripled and
Grinding, revolving, gripping, turning, and returning
as the flung carpet of the wide countryside spreads out on
each side in billows
And in isolation, rolled out, white house, red barn, squat silo,
Pasture, hill, meadow and woodland pasture
And the striped poles step fast past the train windows
Second after second takes snapshots, clicking,
Into the dangled boxes of glinting windows
Snapshots and selections, rejections, at angles, of shadows
A small town: a shop's sign - GARAGE, and then white gates
Where waiting cars wait with the unrest of trembling
Breathing hard and idling, until the slow~descent
Of the red cones of sunset: a dead march: a slow tread and heavy
Of the slowed horses of Apollo

And all things are parked, slowly or willingly,
into the customary or at random places."

396,Emotion,TravelPoemsQuestionsOfTravelPoembyElizabethBishop,"There are too many waterfalls here; the crowded streams
hurry too rapidly down to the sea,
and the pressure of so many clouds on the mountaintops
makes them spill over the sides in soft slow-motion,
turning to waterfalls under our very eyes.
- For if those streaks, those mile-long, shiny, tearstains,
aren't waterfalls yet,
in a quick age or so, as ages go here,
they probably will be.
But if the streams and clouds keep travelling, travelling,
the mountains look like the hulls of capsized ships,
slime-hung and barnacled.
Think of the long trip home.
Should we have stayed at home and thought of here?
Where should we be today?
Is it right to be watching strangers in a play
in this strangest of theatres?
What childishness is it that while there's a breath of life
in our bodies, we are determined to rush
to see the sun the other way around?
The tiniest green hummingbird in the world?
To stare at some inexplicable old stonework,
inexplicable and impenetrable,
at any view,
instantly seen and always, always delightful?
Oh, must we dream our dreams
and have them, too?
And have we room
for one more folded sunset, still quite warm?
But surely it would have been a pity
not to have seen the trees along this road,
really exaggerated in their beauty,
not to have seen them gesturing
like noble pantomimists, robed in pink.
- Not to have had to stop for gas and heard
the sad, two-noted, wooden tune
of disparate wooden clogs
carelessly clacking over
a grease-stained filling-station floor.
(In another country the clogs would all be tested.
Each pair there would have identical pitch.)
- A pity not to have heard
the other, less primitive music of the fat brown bird
who sings above the broken gasoline pump
in a bamboo church of Jesuit baroque:
three towers, five silver crosses.
- Yes, a pity not to have pondered,
blurr'dly and inconclusively,
on what connection can exist for centuries
between the crudest wooden footwear
and, careful and finicky,
the whittled fantasies of wooden cages
- Never to have studied history in
the weak calligraphy of songbirds' cages.
- And never to have had to listen to rain
so much like politicians' speeches:
two hours of unrelenting oratory
and then a sudden golden silence
in which the traveller takes a notebook, writes:
'Is it lack of imagination that makes us come
to imagined places, not just stay at home?
Or could Pascal have been not entirely right
about just sitting quietly in one's room?
Continent, city, country, society:
the choice is never wide and never free.
And here, or there... No. Should we have stayed at home,
wherever that may be? '"

But the Barrister, weary of proving in vain
That the Beaver's lace-making was wrong,
Fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain
That his fancy had dwelt on so long.
He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court,
Where the Snark, with a glass in its eye,
Dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig
On the charge of deserting its sty.
The Witnesses proved, without error or flaw,
That the sty was deserted when found:
And the Judge kept explaining the state of the law
In a soft under-current of sound.
The indictment had never been clearly expressed,
And it seemed that the Snark had begun,
And had spoken three hours, before any one guessed
What the pig was supposed to have done.
The Jury had each formed a different view
(Long before the indictment was read),
And they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew
One word that the others had said.
""You must know--"" said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed ""Fudge!""
That statute is obsolete quite!
Let me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends
On an ancient manorial right.
""In the matter of Treason the pig would appear
To have aided, but scarcely abetted:
While the charge of Insolvency fails, it is clear,
If you grant the plea 'never indebted'.
""The fact of Desertion I will not dispute:
But its guilt, as I trust, is removed
(So far as relates to the costs of this suit)
By the Alibi which has been proved.
""My poor client's fate now depends on your votes.""
Here the speaker sat down in his place,
And directed the Judge to refer to his notes
And briefly to sum up the case.
But the Judge said he never had summed up before;
So the Snark undertook it instead,
And summed it so well that it came to far more
Than the Witnesses ever had said!
When the verdict was called for, the Jury declined,
As the word was so puzzling to spell;
But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn't mind
Undertaking that duty as well.
So the Snark found the verdict, although, as it owned,
It was spent with the toils of the day:
When it said the word ""GUILTY!"" the Jury all groaned
And some of them fainted away.
Then the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being quite
Too nervous to utter a word:
When it rose to its feet, there was silence like night,
And the fall of a pin might be heard.
""Transportation for life"" was the sentence it gave,
""And then to be fined forty pound.""
The Jury all cheered, though the Judge said he feared
That the phrase was not legally sound.
But their wild exultation was suddenly checked
When the jailer informed them, with tears,
Such a sentence would not have the slightest effect,
As the pig had been dead for some years.
The Judge left the Court, looking deeply disgusted
But the Snark, though a little aghast,
As the lawyer to whom the defence was intrusted,
Went bellowing on to the last.
Thus the Barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed
To grow every moment more clear:
Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell,
Which the Bellman rang close at his ear."

One more fence and we're out on the open,
So to us at once, if you want to live near us!
Hark to them, ride to them, beauties! as on they go,
Leaping and sweeping away in the vale below!
Cowards and bunglers, whose heart or whose eye is slow,
Find themselves staring alone.
So the great cause flashes by;
Nearer and clearer its purposes open,
While louder and prouder the world-echoes cheer us:
Gentlemen sportsmen, you ought to live up to us,
Lead us, and lift us, and hallo our game to us-
We cannot call the hounds off, and no shame to us-
Don't be left staring alone!

Every Saturdays and Sunday there is a war going on in the woods,
man against birds and rabbits. On my lemon tree sparrows and
hawks sit and wait for Monday. In my garden rabbits seek shelter
from shoot gun pellets, eat my flowers and dig holes. My dog is
desperate its instinct is to go out and kill them. Killing for sport, is
like bullfighting without spectators, grown men, sneaking about
amongst trees slaughtering the innocent; not unlike the Settlers
behaviour against the Palestinian olive pickers and goat herders.
Monday morning I shovel wheel barrow’s full of bird droppings
from the ground that is also full of holes. Something got to be done
with these awful animals, why do they not move to neighbouring
woods and seek shelter there?"

If his heart be true, I care not what his pocket may afford;
And may he ever pleasantly each gallant sport pursue,
If he takes his liquor fairly, and his fences fairly, too.
He cares not for the bubbles of Fortune's fickle tide,
Who like Bendigo can battle, and like Olliver can ride.
He laughs at those who caution, at those who chide he'll frown,
As he clears a five-foot paling, or he knocks a peeler down.
The dull, cold world may blame us, boys! but what care we the while,
If coral lips will cheer us, and bright eyes on us smile?
For beauty's fond caresses can most tenderly repay
The weariness and trouble of many an anxious day.
Then fill your glass, and drain it, too, with all your heart and soul,
To the best of sports — The Fox-hunt, The Fair Ones, and The Bowl,
To a stout heart in adversity through every ill to steer,
And when Fortune smiles a score of friends like those around us here"
405,Emotion,HuntingPoemsHouseHuntingPoembyEdgarAlbertGuest,"Time was when spring returned we went
To find another home to rent;
We wanted fresher, cleaner walls,
And bigger rooms and wider halls,
And open plumbing and the dome
That made the fashionable home.
But now with spring we want to sell,
And seek a finer place to dwell.
Our thoughts have turned from dens and domes;
We want the latest thing in homes;
To life we'll not be reconciled
Until we have a bathroom tiled.
A butler's pantry we desire,
Although no butler do we hire;
Nell's life will be one round of gloom
Without a closet for the broom,
And mine will dreary be and sour
Unless the bathroom has a shower.
For months and months we've sat and dreamed
Of paneled walls and ceilings beamed
And built-in cases for the books,
An attic room to be the cook's.
No house will she consent to view
Unless it has a sun room, too.
There must be wash bowls here and there
To save much climbing of the stair;
A sleeping porch we both demand —
This fad has swept throughout the land —
And, Oh, 'twill give her heart a wrench
Not to possess a few doors, French.
I want to dig and walk around
At least full fifty feet of ground;
She wants the latest style in tubs;
I want more room for trees and shrubs,
And a garage, with light and heat,
That can be entered from the street.
The trouble is the things we seek
Cannot be bought for ten-a-week.
And all the joys for which we sigh
Are just too rich for us to buy.

The thing we're lacking most is cash."

THE LANDING
'Just the place for a Snark!' the Bellman cried,
As he landed his crew with care;
Supporting each man on the top of the tide
By a finger entwined in his hair.
'Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice:
That alone should encourage the crew.
Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice:
What i tell you three times is true.'
The crew was complete: it included a Boots--
A maker of Bonnets and Hoods--
A Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes--
And a Broker, to value their goods.
A Billiard-maker, whose skill was immense,
Might perhaps have won more than his share--
But a Banker, engaged at enormous expense,
Had the whole of their cash in his care.
There was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck,
Or would sit making lace in the bow:
And had often (the Bellman said) saved them from wreck,
Though none of the sailors knew how.
There was one who was famed for the number of things
He forgot when he entered the ship:
His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,
And the clothes he had bought for the trip.
He had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed,
With his name painted clearly on each:
But, since he omitted to mention the fact,
They were all left behind on the beach.
The loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because
He had seven coats on when he came,
With three pairs of boots--but the worst of it was,
He had wholly forgotten his name.
He would answer to 'Hi!' or to any loud cry,
Such as 'Fry me!' or 'Fritter my wig!'
To 'What-you-may-call-um!' or 'What-was-his-name!'
But especially 'Thing-um-a-jig!'
While, for those who preferred a more forcible word,
He had different names from these:
His intimate friends called him 'Candle-ends,'
And his enemies 'Toasted-cheese.'
'His form in ungainly--his intellect small--'
(So the Bellman would often remark)
'But his courage is perfect! And that, after all,
Is the thing that one needs with a Snark.'
He would joke with hyenas, returning their stare
With an impudent wag of the head:
And he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear,
'Just to keep up its spirits,' he said.
He came as a Baker: but owned, when too late--
And it drove the poor Bellman half-mad--
He could only bake Bridecake--for which, I may state,
No materials were to be had.
The last of the crew needs especial remark,
Though he looked an incredible dunce:
He had just one idea--but, that one being 'Snark,'
The good Bellman engaged him at once.
He came as a Butcher: but gravely declared,
When the ship had been sailing a week,
He could only kill Beavers. The Bellman looked scared,
And was almost too frightened to speak:
But at length he explained, in a tremulous tone,
There was only one Beaver on board;
And that was a tame one he had of his own,
Whose death would be deeply deplored.
The Beaver, who happened to hear the remark,
Protested, with tears in its eyes,
That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark
Could atone for that dismal surprise!
It strongly advised that the Butcher should be
Conveyed in a separate ship:
But the Bellman declared that would never agree
With the plans he had made for the trip:
Navigation was always a difficult art,
Though with only one ship and one bell:
And he feared he must really decline, for his part,
Undertaking another as well.
The Beaver's best course was, no doubt, to procure
A second-hand dagger-proof coat--
So the Baker advised it-- and next, to insure
Its life in some Office of note:
This the Banker suggested, and offered for hire
(On moderate terms), or for sale,
Two excellent Policies, one Against Fire,
And one Against Damage From Hail.
Yet still, ever after that sorrowful day,
Whenever the Butcher was by,
The Beaver kept looking the opposite way,
And appeared unaccountably shy.
Fit the Second
THE BELLMAN'S SPEECH
The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies--
Such a carriage, such ease and such grace!
Such solemnity, too! One could see he was wise,
The moment one looked in his face!
He had bought a large map representing the sea,
Without the least vestige of land:
And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be
A map they could all understand.
'What's the good of Mercator's North Poles and Equators,
Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines?'
So the Bellman would cry: and the crew would reply
'They are merely conventional signs!
'Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes!
But we've got our brave Captain to thank:
(So the crew would protest) 'that he's bought us the best--
A perfect and absolute blank!'
This was charming, no doubt; but they shortly found out
That the Captain they trusted so well
Had only one notion for crossing the ocean,
And that was to tingle his bell.
He was thoughtful and grave--but the orders he gave
Were enough to bewilder a crew.
When he cried 'Steer to starboard, but keep her head larboard!'
What on earth was the helmsman to do?
Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes:
A thing, as the Bellman remarked,
That frequently happens in tropical climes,
When a vessel is, so to speak, 'snarked.'
But the principal failing occurred in the sailing,
And the Bellman, perplexed and distressed,
Said he had hoped, at least, when the wind blew due East,
That the ship would not travel due West!
But the danger was past--they had landed at last,
With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags:
Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view,
Which consisted to chasms and crags.
The Bellman perceived that their spirits were low,
And repeated in musical tone
Some jokes he had kept for a season of woe--
But the crew would do nothing but groan.
He served out some grog with a liberal hand,
And bade them sit down on the beach:
And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand,
As he stood and delivered his speech.
'Friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears!'
(They were all of them fond of quotations:
So they drank to his health, and they gave him three cheers,
While he served out additional rations).
'We have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks,
(Four weeks to the month you may mark),
But never as yet ('tis your Captain who speaks)
Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark!
'We have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days,
(Seven days to the week I allow),
But a Snark, on the which we might lovingly gaze,
We have never beheld till now!
'Come, listen, my men, while I tell you again
The five unmistakable marks
By which you may know, wheresoever you go,
The warranted genuine Snarks.
'Let us take them in order. The first is the taste,
Which is meager and hollow, but crisp:
Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist,
With a flavor of Will-o-the-wisp.
'Its habit of getting up late you'll agree
That it carries too far, when I say
That it frequently breakfasts at five-o'clock tea,
And dines on the following day.
'The third is its slowness in taking a jest.
Should you happen to venture on one,
It will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed:
And it always looks grave at a pun.
'The fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines,
Which is constantly carries about,
And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes--
A sentiment open to doubt.
'The fifth is ambition. It next will be right
To describe each particular batch:
Distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite,
And those that have whiskers, and scratch.
'For, although common Snarks do no manner of harm,
Yet, I feel it my duty to say,
Some are Boojums--' The Bellman broke off in alarm,
For the Baker had fainted away.
Fit the Third
THE BAKER'S TALE
They roused him with muffins--they roused him with ice--
They roused him with mustard and cress--
They roused him with jam and judicious advice--
They set him conundrums to guess.
When at length he sat up and was able to speak,
His sad story he offered to tell;
And the Bellman cried 'Silence! Not even a shriek!'
And excitedly tingled his bell.
There was silence supreme! Not a shriek, not a scream,
Scarcely even a howl or a groan,
As the man they called 'Ho!' told his story of woe
In an antediluvian tone.
'My father and mother were honest, though poor--'
'Skip all that!' cried the Bellman in haste.
'If it once becomes dark, there's no chance of a Snark--
We have hardly a minute to waste!'
'I skip forty years,' said the Baker, in tears,
'And proceed without further remark
To the day when you took me aboard of your ship
To help you in hunting the Snark.
'A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was named)
Remarked, when I bade him farewell--'
'Oh, skip your dear uncle!' the Bellman exclaimed,
As he angrily tingled his bell.
'He remarked to me then,' said that mildest of men,
' 'If your Snark be a Snark, that is right:
Fetch it home by all means--you may serve it with greens,
And it's handy for striking a light.
' 'You may seek it with thimbles--and seek it with care;
You may hunt it with forks and hope;
You may threaten its life with a railway-share;
You may charm it with smiles and soap--' '
('That's exactly the method,' the Bellman bold
In a hasty parenthesis cried,
'That's exactly the way I have always been told
That the capture of Snarks should be tried!')
' 'But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day,
If your Snark be a Boojum! For then
You will softly and suddenly vanish away,
And never be met with again!'
'It is this, it is this that oppresses my soul,
When I think of my uncle's last words:
And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl
Brimming over with quivering curds!
'It is this, it is this--' 'We have had that before!'
The Bellman indignantly said.
And the Baker replied 'Let me say it once more.
It is this, it is this that I dread!
'I engage with the Snark--every night after dark--
In a dreamy delirious fight:
I serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes,
And I use it for striking a light:
'But if ever I meet with a Boojum, that day,
In a moment (of this I am sure),
I shall softly and suddenly vanish away--
And the notion I cannot endure!'

THE BEAVER'S LESSON
They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
They pursued it with forks and hope;
They threatened its life with a railway-share;
They charmed it with smiles and soap.
Then the Butcher contrived an ingenious plan
For making a separate sally;
And fixed on a spot unfrequented by man,
A dismal and desolate valley.
But the very same plan to the Beaver occurred:
It had chosen the very same place:
Yet neither betrayed, by a sign or a word,
The disgust that appeared in his face.
Each thought he was thinking of nothing but 'Snark'
And the glorious work of the day;
And each tried to pretend that he did not remark
That the other was going that way.
But the valley grew narrow and narrower still,
And the evening got darker and colder,
Till (merely from nervousness, not from goodwill)
They marched along shoulder to shoulder.
Then a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky,
And they knew that some danger was near:
The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail,
And even the Butcher felt queer.
He thought of his childhood, left far far behind--
That blissful and innocent state--
The sound so exactly recalled to his mind
A pencil that squeaks on a slate!
''Tis the voice of the Jubjub!' he suddenly cried.
(This man, that they used to call 'Dunce.')
'As the Bellman would tell you,' he added with pride,
'I have uttered that sentiment once.
''Tis the note of the Jubjub! Keep count, I entreat;
You will find I have told it you twice.
'Tis the song of the Jubjub! The proof is complete,
If only I've stated it thrice.'
The Beaver had counted with scrupulous care,
Attending to every word:
But it fairly lost heart, and outgrabe in despair,
When the third repetition occurred.
It felt that, in spite of all possible pains,
It had somehow contrived to lose count,
And the only thing now was to rack its poor brains
By reckoning up the amount.
'Two added to one--if that could but be done,'
It said, 'with one's fingers and thumbs!'
Recollecting with tears how, in earlier years,
It had taken no pains with its sums.
'The thing can be done,' said the Butcher, 'I think.
The thing must be done, I am sure.
The thing shall be done! Bring me paper and ink,
The best there is time to procure.'
The Beaver brought paper,portfolio, pens,
And ink in unfailing supplies:
While strange creepy creatures came out of their dens,
And watched them with wondering eyes.
So engrossed was the Butcher, he heeded them not,
As he wrote with a pen in each hand,
And explained all the while in a popular style
Which the Beaver could well understand.
'Taking Three as the subject to reason about--
A convenient number to state--
We add Seven, and Ten, and then multiply out
By One Thousand diminished by Eight.
'The result we proceed to divide, as you see,
By Nine Hundred and Ninety Two:
Then subtract Seventeen, and the answer must be
Exactly and perfectly true.
'The method employed I would gladly explain,
While I have it so clear in my head,
If I had but the time and you had but the brain--
But much yet remains to be said.
'In one moment I've seen what has hitherto been
Enveloped in absolute mystery,
And without extra charge I will give you at large
A Lesson in Natural History.'
In his genial way he proceeded to say
(Forgetting all laws of propriety,
And that giving instruction, without introduction,
Would have caused quite a thrill in Society),
'As to temper the Jubjub's a desperate bird,
Since it lives in perpetual passion:
Its taste in costume is entirely absurd--
It is ages ahead of the fashion:
'But it knows any friend it has met once before:
It never will look at a bride:
And in charity-meetings it stands at the door,
And collects--though it does not subscribe.
' Its flavor when cooked is more exquisite far
Than mutton, or oysters, or eggs:
(Some think it keeps best in an ivory jar,
And some, in mahogany kegs:)
'You boil it in sawdust: you salt it in glue:
You condense it with locusts and tape:
Still keeping one principal object in view--
To preserve its symmetrical shape.'
The Butcher would gladly have talked till next day,
But he felt that the lesson must end,
And he wept with delight in attempting to say
He considered the Beaver his friend.
While the Beaver confessed, with affectionate looks
More eloquent even than tears,
It had learned in ten minutes far more than all books
Would have taught it in seventy years.
They returned hand-in-hand, and the Bellman, unmanned
(For a moment) with noble emotion,
Said 'This amply repays all the wearisome days
We have spent on the billowy ocean!'
Such friends, as the Beaver and Butcher became,
Have seldom if ever been known;
In winter or summer, 'twas always the same--
You could never meet either alone.
And when quarrels arose--as one frequently finds
Quarrels will, spite of every endeavor--
The song of the Jubjub recurred to their minds,
And cemented their friendship for ever!
Fit the Sixth
THE BARRISTER'S DREAM
They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
They pursued it with forks and hope;
They threatened its life with a railway-share;
They charmed it with smiles and soap.
But the Barrister, weary of proving in vain
That the Beaver's lace-making was wrong,
Fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain
That his fancy had dwelt on so long.
He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court,
Where the Snark, with a glass in its eye,
Dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig
On the charge of deserting its sty.
The Witnesses proved, without error or flaw,
That the sty was deserted when found:
And the Judge kept explaining the state of the law
In a soft under-current of sound.
The indictment had never been clearly expressed,
And it seemed that the Snark had begun,
And had spoken three hours, before any one guessed
What the pig was supposed to have done.
The Jury had each formed a different view
(Long before the indictment was read),
And they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew
One word that the others had said.
'You must know ---' said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed 'Fudge!'
That statute is obsolete quite!
Let me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends
On an ancient manorial right.
'In the matter of Treason the pig would appear
To have aided, but scarcely abetted:
While the charge of Insolvency fails, it is clear,
If you grant the plea 'never indebted.'
'The fact of Desertion I will not dispute;
But its guilt, as I trust, is removed
(So far as related to the costs of this suit)
By the Alibi which has been proved.
'My poor client's fate now depends on you votes.'
Here the speaker sat down in his place,
And directed the Judge to refer to his notes
And briefly to sum up the case.
But the Judge said he never had summed up before;
So the Snark undertook it instead,
And summed it so well that it came to far more
Than the Witnesses ever had said!
When the verdict was called for, the Jury declined,
As the word was so puzzling to spell;
But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn't mind
Undertaking that duty as well.
So the Snark found the verdict, although, as it owned,
It was spent with the toils of the day:
When it said the word 'GUILTY!' the Jury all groaned,
And some of them fainted away.
Then the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being quite
Too nervous to utter a word:
When it rose to its feet, there was silence like night,
And the fall of a pin might be heard.
'Transportation for lift' was the sentence it gave,
'And *then* to be fined forty pound.'
The Jury all cheered, though the Judge said he feared
That the phrase was not legally sound.
But their wild exultation was suddenly checked
When the jailer informed them, with tears,
Such a sentence would have not the slightest effect,
As the pig had been dead for some years.
The Judge left the Court, looking deeply disgusted:
But the Snark, though a little aghast,
As the lawyer to whom the defense was entrusted,
Went bellowing on to the last.
Thus the Barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed
To grow every moment more clear:
Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell,
Which the Bellman rang close at his ear.
Fit the Seventh
THE BANKER'S FATE
They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
They pursued it with forks and hope;
They threatened its life with a railway-share;
They charmed it with smiles and soap.
And the Banker, inspired with a courage so new
It was matter for general remark,
Rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view
In his zeal to discover the Snark
But while he was seeking with thimbles and care,
A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh
And grabbed at the Banker, who shrieked in despair,
For he knew it was useless to fly.
He offered large discount--he offered a check
(Drawn 'to bearer') for seven-pounds-ten:
But the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck
And grabbed at the Banker again.
Without rest or pause--while those frumious jaws
Went savagely snapping around-
He skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped,
Till fainting he fell to the ground.
The Bandersnatch fled as the others appeared
Led on by that fear-stricken yell:
And the Bellman remarked 'It is just as I feared!'
And solemnly tolled on his bell.
He was black in the face, and they scarcely could trace
The least likeness to what he had been:
While so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white-
A wonderful thing to be seen!
To the horror of all who were present that day.
He uprose in full evening dress,
And with senseless grimaces endeavored to say
What his tongue could no longer express.
Down he sank in a chair--ran his hands through his hair--
And chanted in mimsiest tones
Words whose utter inanity proved his insanity,
While he rattled a couple of bones.
'Leave him here to his fate--it is getting so late!'
The Bellman exclaimed in a fright.
'We have lost half the day. Any further delay,
And we sha'nt catch a Snark before night!'
Fit the Eighth
THE VANISHING
They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
They pursued it with forks and hope;
They threatened its life with a railway-share;
They charmed it with smiles and soap.
They shuddered to think that the chase might fail,
And the Beaver, excited at last,
Went bounding along on the tip of its tail,
For the daylight was nearly past.
'There is Thingumbob shouting!' the Bellman said,
'He is shouting like mad, only hark!
He is waving his hands, he is wagging his head,
He has certainly found a Snark!'
They gazed in delight, while the Butcher exclaimed
'He was always a desperate wag!'
They beheld him--their Baker--their hero unnamed--
On the top of a neighboring crag.
Erect and sublime, for one moment of time.
In the next, that wild figure they saw
(As if stung by a spasm) plunge into a chasm,
While they waited and listened in awe.
'It's a Snark!' was the sound that first came to their ears,
And seemed almost too good to be true.
Then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers:
Then the ominous words 'It's a Boo-'
Then, silence. Some fancied they heard in the air
A weary and wandering sigh
Then sounded like '-jum!' but the others declare
It was only a breeze that went by.
They hunted till darkness came on, but they found
Not a button, or feather, or mark,
By which they could tell that they stood on the ground
Where the Baker had met with the Snark.
In the midst of the word he was trying to say,
In the midst of his laughter and glee,
He had softly and suddenly vanished away---
For the Snark *was* a Boojum, you see."
411,Emotion,HuntingPoemsHuntingBirthsPoembyJohnWeber,"If I were the compassionless sort
without regard for flowing sanctity,
and if hunger more dire than thirst
rocked through me with stings true,
I would think of babies as morsels
of puffy flesh more succulent than
the sinewy knots riddled with tendons
once formed as joints since adults
bend knees with ardor too vast
to grasp pure honesty.
When snacking upon that treasure
trove of future’s calling, I laugh at
the clamor of rattles and chimes
since baby chops prove delicate
bits, stippled with rivulets of soft
fat yet to be flexed in purpose or
pleasure, and children blinded by
innocence never see the devil in
my blood-streaked eyes or the
cherub on my shoulder.
Once sated by my feast of infants,
my hollow chest will rumble loud
till my questing once more lumbers
to pastel quarters of babbling coos.
I shall round up more tinkering grubs
still swaddle-bound by fabric most
cloying, inviting my navy blood to
boil with pathogens unleashed by
centuries of lust, greed and avarice
until prospect staggers lost."
412,Emotion,HuntingPoemsHourOfTheHuntingPoembyLawrenceSPertillar,"Fading seductions,
And reduced temptations...
Do not leave easy,
As we face replacements.
Habits are only bad,
If guilt is applied.
It would be nice...
To be gratified,
Without remorse at its side.
Undoing explicitness,
Is difficult to do without.
Discreeted peeks do not satisfy,
A libido that is denied...
In and outside.
With wishes to be freed,
To 'sniff' a whiff and scatter about!
And there hiding in our minds,
Is an undefined lust that grows.
And the more we try,
Losing that part of us...
Like a diet from it teases,
Until an urgency explodes!
The more the craving,
For 'it'...
Within us shows,
The hounding of the wolf!
'Where are my sunglasses?
It is the hour of the hunting,
To release some grunts! '"
413,Emotion,HuntingPoemsFitTheSecondHuntingOfTheSnarkPoembyLewisCarroll,"The Bellman's Speech
The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies--
Such a carriage, such ease and such grace!
Such solemnity, too! One could see he was wise,
The moment one looked in his face!
He had bought a large map representing the sea,
Without the least vestige of land:
And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be
A map they could all understand.
""What's the good of Mercator's North Poles and Equators,
Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines?""
So the Bellman would cry: and the crew would reply
""They are merely conventional signs!
""Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes!
But we've got our brave Captain to thank""
(So the crew would protest) ""that he's bought us the best--
A perfect and absolute blank!""
This was charming, no doubt: but they shortly found out
That the Captain they trusted so well
Had only one notion for crossing the ocean
And that was to tingle his bell.
He was thoughtful and grave--but the orders he gave
Were enough to bewilder a crew.
When he cried ""Steer to starboard, but keep her head larboard!""
What on earth was the helmsman to do?
Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes:
A thing, as the Bellman remarked,
That frequently happens in tropical climes,
When a vessel is, so to speak, ""snarked"".
But the principal failing occurred in the sailing,
And the Bellman, perplexed and distressed,
Said he had hoped, at least, when the wind blew due East,
That the ship would not travel due West!
But the danger was past--they had landed at last,
With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags:
Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view
Which consisted of chasms and crags.
The Bellman perceived that their spirits were low,
And repeated in musical tone
Some jokes he had kept for a season of woe--
But the crew would do nothing but groan.
He served out some grog with a liberal hand,
And bade them sit down on the beach:
And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand,
As he stood and delivered his speech.
""Friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears!""
(They were all of them fond of quotations:
So they drank to his health, and they gave him three cheers,
While he served out additional rations).
""We have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks,
(Four weeks to the month you may mark),
But never as yet ('tis your Captain who speaks)
Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark!
""We have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days,
(Seven days to the week I allow),
But a Snark, on the which we might lovingly gaze,
We have never beheld till now!
""Come, listen, my men, while I tell you again
The five unmistakable marks
By which you may know, wheresoever you go,
The warranted genuine Snarks.
""Let us take them in order. The first is the taste,
Which is meagre and hollow, but crisp:
Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist,
With a flavour of Will-o'-the-Wisp.
""Its habit of getting up late you'll agree
That it carries too far, when I say
That it frequently breakfasts at five-o'clock tea,
And dines on the following day.
""The third is its slowness in taking a jest.
Should you happen to venture on one,
It will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed:
And it always looks grave at a pun.
""The fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines,
Which it constantly carries about,
And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes--
A sentiment open to doubt.
""The fifth is ambition. It next will be right
To describe each particular batch:
Distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite,
From those that have whiskers, and scratch.
""For, although common Snarks do no manner of harm,
Yet I feel it my duty to say
Some are Boojums--"" The Bellman broke off in alarm,
For the Baker had fainted away."

416,Emotion,HuntingPoemsFoxHuntingIsBannedInBritainPoembyFrancisDuggan,"A so called sport of the upper class that inspired the bards to rhyme
Fox hunting is banned in Britain everything has it's time
For nothing last forever it had passed it's use by date
And in chasing down and killing a frightened creature what is to celebrate?
John Masefield's long poem 'Reynard the Fox' I readily can recall
One of the best on fox hunting if not the best of all
But that aside fox hunting was cruel or to me 'twould seem that way
For to be hunted down and mauled to death by dogs not what you'd call fair play.
I read in the Newspapers how those for fox hunting protested long and loud
But there was nothing in this so called sport of which they could feel proud
For to watch a creature torn to shreds could hardly be much fun
It seems a far more painful way to die than the quicker death by gun.
The day is near when all blood sports will be things of the past
For all things have their use by date and nothing seems to last
Some may see the fox as vermin but the fox warrants a fair go
And empathy for wild born creatures not too much to ask to show.
Fox hunting is banned in Britain such good news is good to hear
News well worth celebrating to that I'll drink a beer
To be torn to shreds by a pack of hounds seems an awful way to die
And to this very cruel blood sport good riddance and goodbye."

418,Emotion,HuntingPoemsHuntingForYourElusiveLovePoembyRobertRorabeck,"How can I give you more of this ever failing verse?
I pick a line for you, it withers before it reaches your lips.
If I do not pick something beautiful enough,
You grow inattentive,
And give your heart to brave soldiers.
So I travel up the lighted stairs to the attic
Where the grandfather lives with his little girl.
They know everything about the mountains,
And they can sing:
I bottle their romance in an empty medicine bottle.
The label is torn off,
And you can use it for a vase;
It is easily big enough for all the things that I say,
To puncture your heart with an arrow head
I stole from my mother,
And that gives me time to look for new phrases
That grow where the dead men lay tongue-tied
In the ravishing gardens:
As you pause,
Because it is dangerous, the games we young men play,
And at anytime you can return to your queen:
In the forms of water and wood,
Just one suckle from the breast of that muse,
The lady only the published can tackle,
And you will never again turn your head to this page,
So I must open up these wrists
And search for the novel species of a diviner kingdom,
Leaping through the canals and estuaries,
For phrasings of thought I have to discover,
To butter your lips, and butcher your heart,
Because your are the kind my wanting needs,
And no other, though I may live alone
In the valleys of unrestive  attentions unto old age,
I will remain for you the cartographer of perfumes,
The trapper of far away gazes,
Hunting for your elusive love."

421,Emotion,HuntingPoemsHuntingAndGatheringPoembyRobertRorabeck,"Weren’t there poets before there were words,
Cause didn’t they need love in the boreal eras of moose and rime-
My brothers, the grandfathers of her eyes of sad prehistory;
When her shoulders are naked opal on the stereoscopic hills:
Expressing themselves with bitter howls to
The throbbing night,
And in the flickering stalactites of fanged caverns,
Dripping with the minerals of torpid architecture,
As in the wombs of the earth, and the animals without names
Roaming, the men without names:
They can smell her joints through her skin, and her needs.
Wasn’t there love then all of the truth,
The magnetic directions without slabs of death:
The concrete tombs we go into work now:
And the occupations which give us the speech of our employers,
The busy blue cars buzz from each infected wound.
And didn’t our antediluvian lovers know better of love,
Wordless, speechless hunting for the vocabularies
Nothing more than mist from her sought lips:
The need to survive,
Her thighs skipping across stones on the high banks:
An icicle drips, she cries naked like a blue lion in the trees,
As the clouds swathe the highest points of the earth like mourners:
Wanting them, wanting something from her peripheral vision:
The heavenly crux of his stonebuilder hands cupping her,
Unwashed, untrimmed;
The poetry in the body like scraping flint,
The discovery of fire: the ecstatic truth of the leather tramps;
Now: all of this,
And the attempts the blue collared scribes make to
Scratch it out: This is not love. This is not rhyme.
The city moves, but doesn’t breathe, the lines do not lead to water.
This is not poetry, and there is not a poet left alive
Who doesn’t live in the cages of feral wolves, snarling his proofs,
Though we fools swirl the wine down our throats,
And call the doggerel of cadavers good:
Where they found her then could never be spoken,
But the quiet sentinels horned and pined swayed unreasonably:
That was the only time there was poetry:
Poetry is forgotten.... Poetry is living above the mountains,
And beneath the seas: Poetry has fled to the moon Unspoken: Now,
Only arithmetic of uneven sums,
The tin halos of politicians who worship no one but steady whores;
The men with cap guns, the plastic conquistadors.
Come down from this; it isn’t real. This is the last quarter in the machine.
Afterwards, it will go still.
It will stop entertaining us with whizzing predictions.
Then my love will find us muted in our time, and she will press
Our love to us from her love,
As flowers are kept in between the pages of lonely authors,
And there will be nothing to be said;
And there will be everything shouted from her gaze.
We will not say a word. We will return to her shelter,
And to the throbbing chambers,
The poetry we will reclaim,
We will neither hear nor speak."

lies next to him in pieces
in the faint light of the hunting lodge
where he is cleaning the weapon
and in the distance a jackal
is calling at dusk,
he notices a swarm of wild doves
landing in the marula tree.
When the parts of the weapon
is joined as it belongs,
he carefully puts the weapon away
before he walks out
joining his wife at the barbeque fire
and the smell of fried lamb chops
makes his stomach growl
while he takes a pair of frying tongs from her,
turning around strings of sausages
above them the stars in the night sky
are shot-gunned into the black,
there are hyenas attracted by the smell
of the frying meat
laughing behind some trees,
somewhere he hears a kudu snorting
and the moon hangs yellow-gold above them
while he stirs the porridge
in the black three-legged pot
and his wife can swear
that a leopard with glowing eyes
is peering at them."

The girls in the stream; but they have to
Settle for rattlesnake and his tambourine;

I will make you see what I have seen,
From my belly along the streams
The girls who are chanting to the sailors
They feed, They will never love you,
Never love you- Strange hungry bird,
Though you might look good in the sun,
From side to side, we will make you hear
What we have heard- The women who desire
Your sense of flight but not your love.
Feed us if you will to your children, but you
Are just not enough that thing- Women shall love neither
Of us, laughing on their school bus- but we
Do not desire them. We gave them their first
Knowledge, their first death, their first reason
To orgasm, and for us that is enough- While you
Are just a bird hunting what it can never hope to kill."

With it I hope to kill a 12-point buck
While in the woods, BANG! I see the deer fall
I take him home, freeze the meat, and mount his horns on my wall
I grab my pole and tackle box and head to the lake
At this time in the morning, I feel barely awake
There is no school today, I’m glad there is no class
A mighty tug on my line, I hook a large mouth bass
There is nothing like hunting; waiting for the kill
Cutting and cleaning the meat my freezer I’ll soon fill
Deer steaks and deer jerky have such a great taste
And with his head on my wall nothing goes to waste
I like fishing, fishing is fun
Fishing underneath the rising sun
I like catching the fish and putting them in a net
Fish is a great dish when the table is set
My truck is unstoppable; it can’t beat
I slam the door and strap myself in the seat
I start the engine and press the gas to the floor
My truck takes off and my engine lets out a roar
I wouldn’t be able to hunt or fish if it wasn’t for my truck
With it I carry poles, guns, and my fallen buck
I pull my boat with my truck in four-wheel-drive
At my destination I always arrive"

I've loved sitting next to him in his deer blind
or sitting quietly in my own.
Now that Boomer came into our lives
I see all living animals as having feelings
and I can't stand the thought of hunting.
Boomer is our bassett hound.
He thinks he is human.
I sometimes think so too.
The way he has shown me
that he feels things like we do
has changed me forever.
Now, all I can think of is that
if a dog can feel emotions like we do...
can a deer?
Are they afraid?
Do they know why we are sitting there?
Do they hate me?
I have to explain this to my husband
and pray he understands why
our hunting days together are over."
426,Emotion,HuntingPoemsTheHuntingHornOfChalemagnePoembyCarolineElizabethSarahNorton,"SOUND not the Horn!--the guarded relic keep:
A faithful sharer of its master's sleep:
His life it gladden'd--to his life belong'd,--
Pause--ere thy lip the royal dead hath wrong'd.
Its weary weight but mocks thy feeble hand;
Its desolate note, the shrine wherein we stand.
Not such the sound it gave in days of yore,
When that rich belt a monarch's bosom wore,--
Not such the sound! Far over hill and dell
It waked the echoes with triumphant swell;
Heard midst the rushing of the torrent's fall,
From castled crag to roofless ruin'd hall,
Down the ravine's precipitous descent,
Thro' the wild forest's rustling boughs it went,
Upon the lake's blue bosom linger'd fond,
And faintly answer'd from the hills beyond:
Pause!--the free winds that joyous blast have borne:--
Dead is the hunter!--silent be the horn!
Sound not the horn! Bethink thee of the day
When to the chase an Emperor led the way;
In all the pride of manhood's noblest prime,
Untamed by sorrow, and untired by time,
Life's pulses throbbing in his eager breast,
Glad, active, vigorous,--who is now at rest:--
How he gazed round him with his eagle eye,
Leapt the dark rocks that frown against the sky,
Grasp'd the long spear, and curb'd the panting steed
(Whose fine nerves quiver with his headlong speed),
At the wild cry of danger smiled in scorn,
And firmly sounded that re-echoing horn!
Ah! let no touch the ivory tube profane
Which drank the breath of living Charlemagne;
Let not like blast by meaner lips be blown,
But by the hunter's side the horn lay down!
Or, following to his palace, dream we now
Not of the hunter's strength, or forest bough,
But woman's love! HER offering this, perchance,--
This, granted to each stranger's casual glance,
This, gazed upon with coldly curious eyes,
Was giv'n with blushes, and received with sighs!
We see her not;--no mournful angel stands
To guard her love-gift from our careless hands;
But fancy brings a vision to our view--
A woman's form, the trusted and the true:
The strong to suffer, tho' so weak to dare
Patient to watch thro' many a day of care,
Devoted, anxious, generous, void of guile,
And with her whole heart's welcome in her smile;
Even such I see! Her maidens, too, are there,
And wake, with chorus sweet, some native air;
But tho' her proud heart holds her country dear,
And tho' she loves those happy songs to hear,
She bids the tale be hush'd, the harp be still,
For one faint blast that dies along the hill.
Up, up, she springs; her young head backward thrown;
'He comes! my hunter comes!--Mine own--mine own!'
She loves, and she is loved--her gift is worn--
'Tis fancy, all!--And yet--lay down the horn!
Love--life--what are ye?--since to love and live
No surer record to our times can give!
Low lies the hero now, whose spoken name
Could fire with glory, or with love inflame;
Low lies the arm of might, the form of pride,
And dim tradition dreameth by his side.
Desolate stand those painted palace-halls,
And gradual ruin mines the massy walls,
Where frank hearts greeted many a welcome guest,
And loudly rang the beaker and the jest;--
While here, within this chapel's narrow bound,
Whose frozen silence startles to the sound
Of stranger voices ringing thro' the air,
Of faintly echoes many a humble prayer;
Here, where the window, narrow arch'd, and high,
With jealous bars shuts out the free blue sky,--
Where glimmers down, with various-painted ray,
A prison'd portion of God's glorious day,--
Where never comes the breezy breath of morn,
Here, mighty hunter, feebly wakes thy horn!"

429,Emotion,HuntingPoemsSurfaceHuntingPoembyClaudiaEmerson,"You always washed artifacts
at the kitchen sink, your back
to the room, to me, to the mud
you'd tracked in from whatever
neighbor's field had just been plowed.
Spearpoints, birdpoints, awls and leaf-
shaped blades surfaced from the turned earth
as though from beneath some thicker
water you tried to see into.
You never tired, you told me, of the tangible
past you could admire, turn over
and over in your hand—the first
to touch it since the dead one that had
worked the stone. You lined bookshelves
and end tables with them; obsidian,
quartz, flint, they measured the hours you'd spent
with your head down, searching for others,
and also the prized hours of my own
solitude—collected, prized,
saved alongside those artifacts
that had been for so long lost"
430,Emotion,HuntingPoemsIAmBereftOfAngerForHuntingOtherThanForFoodPoembyDannyDraper,"I am bereft of anger
that has passed through rage
For the empty humans that
Cannot share or partake in this one Earth
They have removed themselves
from our greater ken
and the union of all life
They can no longer return to us,
not due to being out laws
But due to being outliers
from the sum of our potential
and better nature to know right from wrong
and respect inherently
the dignity of all life."
431,Emotion,HuntingPoemsKaasHuntingPoembyRudyardKipling,"His spots are the joy of the Leopard: his horns are the Buffalo’s pride.
Be clean, for the strength of the hunter is known by the gloss of his hide.
If ye find that the bullock can toss you, or the heavy-browed Sambhur can gore;
Ye need not stop work to inform us: we knew it ten seasons before.
Oppress not the cubs of the stranger, but hail them as Sister and Brother,
For though they are little and fubsy, it may be the Bear is their mother.
‘There is none like to me !’ says the Cub in the pride of his earliest kill;
But the jungle is large and the Cub he is small. Let him think and be still."
432,Emotion,HuntingPoemsAHuntingSongPoembyEdithWharton,"Hunters, where does Hope nest?
Not in the half-oped breast,
Nor the young rose,
Nor April sunrise—those
With a quick wing she brushes,
The wide world through,
Greets with the throat of thrushes,
Fades from as fast as dew.
But, would you spy her sleeping,
Cradled warm,
Look in the breast of weeping,
The tree stript by storm;
But, would you bind her fast,
Yours at last,
Bed-mate and lover,
Gain the last headland bare
That the cold tides cover,
There may you capture her, there,
Where the sea gives to the ground
Only the drift of the drowned.
Yet, if she slips you, once found,
Push to her uttermost lair
In the low house of despair.
There will she watch by your head,
Sing to you till you be dead,
Then, with your child in her breast,
In another heart build a new nest."
433,Emotion,HuntingPoemsToTheHappyHuntingGroundsPoembyAmbroseBierce,"Wide windy reaches of high stubble field;
A long gray road, bordered with dusty pines;
A wagon moving in a 'cloud by day.'
Two city sportsmen with a dove between,
Breast-high upon a fence and fast asleep
A solitary dove, the only dove
In twenty counties, and it sick, or else
It were not there. Two guns that fire as one,
With thunder simultaneous and loud;
Two shattered human wrecks of blood and bone!
And later, in the gloaming, comes a man
The worthy local coroner is he,
Renowned all thereabout, and popular
With many a remain. All tenderly
Compiling in a game-bag the debris,
He glides into the gloom and fades from sight.
The dove, cured of its ailment by the shock,
Has flown, meantime, on pinions strong and fleet,
To die of age in some far foreign land."
434,Emotion,HuntingPoemsAHuntingExpeditionPoembyGertStrydom,"Far off in the bush veldt near to Marken,
where the red sand lies like sea sand,
a young hunter on a day
takes a old.303 rifle with open sights
and walks following a tracker,
that they call a guide,
past green thorn trees
with long white camel-thorns
to where a impala
is standing against a hillock
and he aims for a headshot
and I say to him: “shoot for the shoulder-blade”
but he doesn’t listen
and when the shot resounds
the antelope lowers its head
and the bullet whistles away from a rock plate
with the antelope
running away in a red brown stripe
disappearing into the bushes
and the bush veldt sun
burns without mercy down on us."
435,Emotion,HuntingPoemsGoldenEagleeaglesHuntingAndCaringForYoungPoembyBriEdwards,"A Golden Eagle stands tall upon its perch,
with keen eyes, for its next victim to search.
Suddenly it spreads wings, is off with a lurch,
sweeping low o'er groves of aspen and birch.
A jackrabbit stirs near a clump of brush.
Silently toward it the eagle does rush.
The rabbit's life-ending cry breaks the hush.
Too late!  The eagle, its backbones does crush.
With rabbit in tow it flies to its nest
where its chick gobbles warm handouts with zest.
With its mate the parent shares all the rest,
preparing themselves for the next hunting quest.

436,Emotion,HuntingPoemsHuntingCivilWarRelicsAtNimblewillCreekPoembyJamesDickey,"As he moves the mine detector
A few inches over the ground,
Making it vitally float
Among the ferns and weeds,
I come into this war
Slowly, with my one brother,
Watching his face grow deep
Between the earphones,
For I can tell
If we enter the buried battle
Of Nimblewill
Only by his expression.
Softly he wanders, parting
The grass with a dreaming hand.
No dead cry yet takes root
In his clapped ears
Or can be seen in his smile.
But underfoot I feel
The dead regroup,
The burst metals all in place,
The battle lines be drawn
Anew to include us
In Nimblewill,
And I carry the shovel and pick
More as if they were
Bright weapons that I bore.
A bird's cry breaks
In two, and into three parts.
We cross the creek; the cry
Shifts into another,
Nearer, bird, and is
Like the shout of a shadow—
Lived-with, appallingly close—
Or the soul, pronouncing
'Nimblewill':
Three tones; your being changes.
We climb the bank;
A faint light glows
On my brother's mouth.
I listen, as two birds fight
For a single voice, but he
Must be hearing the grave,
In pieces, all singing
To his clamped head,
For he smiles as if
He rose from the dead within
Green Nimblewill
And stood in his grandson's shape.
No shot from the buried war
Shall kill me now,
For the dead have waited here
A hundred years to create
Only the look on the face
Of my one brother,
Who stands among them, offering
A metal dish
Afloat in the trembling weeds,
With a long-buried light on his lips
At Nimblewill
And the dead outsinging two birds.
I choke the handle
Of the pick, and fall to my knees
To dig wherever he points,
To bring up mess tin or bullet,
To go underground
Still singing, myself,
Without a sound,
Like a man who renounces war,
Or one who shall lift up the past,
Not breathing 'Father,'
At Nimblewill,
But saying, 'Fathers! Fathers!'"
437,Emotion,HuntingPoemsCrumbHuntingPoembySusanLacovara,"Soaring gull, against the sky
I, on wing, to circle high
On a path to seek, begin
All the crumbs you lay quite thin
On my search to strongly feast
On your trailing beauty beach
Diving fast to steal a taste
Of Your quicken discarded waste
For one morsel in the sand
Not the waving of your hand
In your growing shorter shadow
On a passing breeze to straddle
Eyeing pieces of your promise
Set coordinating compass
Steering straight my downward spiral
Fighting off whomever rivals
My catching and consuming
As the crimson sunset looming
Makes your tidbits left so tempting
A retrieval task, lamenting
My feathers flash their bunting
Headfirst falling while crumb hunting"

439,Emotion,HuntingPoemsFitTheFirstHuntingOfTheSnarkPoembyLewisCarroll,"The Landing
""Just the place for a Snark!"" the Bellman cried,
As he landed his crew with care;
Supporting each man on the top of the tide
By a finger entwined in his hair.
""Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice:
That alone should encourage the crew.
Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice:
What I tell you three times is true.""
The crew was complete: it included a Boots--
A maker of Bonnets and Hoods--
A Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes--
And a Broker, to value their goods.
A Billiard-marker, whose skill was immense,
Might perhaps have won more than his share--
But a Banker, engaged at enormous expense,
Had the whole of their cash in his care.
There was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck,
Or would sit making lace in the bow:
And had often (the Bellman said) saved them from wreck
Though none of the sailors knew how.
There was one who was famed for the number of things
He forgot when he entered the ship:
His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,
And the clothes he had bought for the trip.
He had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed,
With his name painted clearly on each:
But, since he omitted to mention the fact,
They were all left behind on the beach.
The loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because
He had seven coats on when he came,
With three pair of boots--but the worst of is was,
He had wholly forgotten his name.
He would answer to ""Hi!"" or to any loud cry,
Such as ""Fry me!"" or ""Fritter my wig!""
To ""What-you-may-call-um!"" or ""What-was-his-name!""
But especially ""Thing-um-a-jig!""
While, for those who preferred a more forcible word,
He had different names from these:
His intimate friends called him ""Candle-ends"",
And his enemies ""Toasted-cheese""
""His form is ungainly--his intellect small--""
(So the Bellman would often remark)--
""But his courage is perfect! And that, after all,
Is the thing that one needs with a Snark.""
He would joke with hyaenas, returning their stare
With an impudent wag of the head:
And he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear,
""Just to keep up its spirits,"" he said.
He came as a Baker: but owned, when too late--
And it drove the poor Bellman half-mad--
He could only bake Bridecake--for which, I may state,
No materials were to be had.
The last of the crew needs especial remark,
Though he looked an incredible dunce:
He had just one idea--but, that one being ""Snark"",
The good Bellman engaged him at once.
He came as a Butcher: but gravely declared,
When the ship had been sailing a week,
He could only kill Beavers. The Bellman looked scared,
And was almost too frightened to speak:
But at length he explained, in a tremulous tone,
There was only one Beaver on board;
And that was a tame one he had of his own,
Whose death would be deeply deplored.
The Beaver, who happened to hear the remark,
Protested, with tears in its eyes,
That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark
Could atone for that dismal surprise!
It strongly advised that the Butcher should be
Conveyed in a separate ship:
But the Bellman declared that would never agree
With the plans he had made for the trip:
Navigation was always a difficult art,
Though with only one ship and one bell:
And he feared he must really decline, for his part,
Undertaking another as well.
The Beaver's best course was, no doubt, to procure
A second-hand dagger-proof coat--
So the baker advised it--and next, to insure
Its life in some Office of note:
This the Baker suggested, and offered for hire
(On moderate terms), or for sale,
Two excellent Policies, one Against Fire
And one Against Damage From Hail.
Yet still, ever after that sorrowful day,
Whenever the Butcher was by,
The Beaver kept looking the opposite way,
And appeared unaccountably shy."
440,Emotion,HuntingPoemsThereOughtToBeABanOnWhaleHuntingPoembyFrancisDuggan,"There ought to be a Worldwide ban on whale hunting since all species of whales are becoming rare
And of the justification of killing them in the name of so called science the enlightened and aware
On the sensitive issue of whaling will tell you that this is all lies
That killing in the name of science of marine mammals has always only been a guise
For commercialism at the expense of endangered species the human record on conservation is bad
The number of creatures extinct and facing extinction for to contemplate even too sad
Habitat destruction and killing creatures for greed of money in the World has never been more rife
Yet we do not own the Planet we live on we too are part of it's Natural life,
'Tis true that extinction is forever as dead as the dodo they say
And more creatures becoming extinct or facing extinction each day
For centuries Humans have been trying to destroy Nature we pollute the rivers the Land, sea and sky
But Nature will live on forever 'tis only ourselves we'll destroy
So why not ban the needless slaughter forever of the last great mammals of the sea
We must pay more respect to Nature and protect her creatures the wildborn and the free."

You feel at ease immediately.
It is if the walls recall
What happened here and store it all.
The triumphs and the tragedies
Firm memories of past events
Have been recorded faithfully
Each and every incident.
If you are at all sensitive
You tune into the ambience,
the positive and negative.
Impinge somehow so you can sense.
That something dreadful happened here
It may be faint it may be strong
but it affects the atmosphere.
You know at once this house is wrong
You’re certain that it will not do.
You have no doubt, no doubt at all
You know the house is telling you
it has no choice it must recall
All the unpleasant memories
which it has stored so faithfully.
For decades perhaps centuries.
You choose to leave immediately.
The next house which you choose to view
affects you in a different way.
It seems prepared to welcome you.
You can decide without delay
It is not hard to make the choice
This is the house that you will buy
You listen to that house’s voice
because you know it cannot lie.
You go ahead complete the deal
prepare to move in right away
You are content because you feel
that everything has gone your way.
You know that it was meant to be
It’s all that you were looking for.
This house responds positively
You need not look at any more.

447,Emotion,HuntingPoemsTheSongOfHiawathaXviiTheHuntingOfPauPukKeewisPoembyHenryWadsworthLongfellow,"Full of wrath was Hiawatha
When he came into the village,
Found the people in confusion,
Heard of all the misdemeanors,
All the malice and the mischief,
Of the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis.
Hard his breath came through his nostrils,
Through his teeth he buzzed and muttered
Words of anger and resentment,
Hot and humming, like a hornet.
'I will slay this Pau-Puk-Keewis,
Slay this mischief-maker!' said he.
'Not so long and wide the world is,
Not so rude and rough the way is,
That my wrath shall not attain him,
That my vengeance shall not reach him!'
Then in swift pursuit departed
Hiawatha and the hunters
On the trail of Pau-Puk-Keewis,
Through the forest, where he passed it,
To the headlands where he rested;
But they found not Pau-Puk-Keewis,
Only in the trampled grasses,
In the whortleberry-bushes,
Found the couch where he had rested,
Found the impress of his body.
From the lowlands far beneath them,
From the Muskoday, the meadow,
Pau-Puk-Keewis, turning backward,
Made a gesture of defiance,
Made a gesture of derision;
And aloud cried Hiawatha,
From the summit of the mountains:
'Not so long and wide the world is,
Not so rude and rough the way is,
But my wrath shall overtake you,
And my vengeance shall attain you!'
Over rock and over river,
Through bush, and brake, and forest,
Ran the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis;
Like an antelope he bounded,
Till he came unto a streamlet
In the middle of the forest,
To a streamlet still and tranquil,
That had overflowed its margin,
To a dam made by the beavers,
To a pond of quiet water,
Where knee-deep the trees were standing,
Where the water lilies floated,
Where the rushes waved and whispered.
On the dam stood Pau-Puk-Keewis,
On the dam of trunks and branches,
Through whose chinks the water spouted,
O'er whose summit flowed the streamlet.
From the bottom rose the beaver,
Looked with two great eyes of wonder,
Eyes that seemed to ask a question,
At the stranger, Pau-Puk-Keewis.
On the dam stood Pau-Puk-Keewis,
O'er his ankles flowed the streamlet,
Flowed the bright and silvery water,
And he spake unto the beaver,
With a smile he spake in this wise:
'O my friend Ahmeek, the beaver,
Cool and pleasant Is the water;
Let me dive into the water,
Let me rest there in your lodges;
Change me, too, into a beaver!'
Cautiously replied the beaver,
With reserve he thus made answer:
'Let me first consult the others,
Let me ask the other beavers.'
Down he sank into the water,
Heavily sank he, as a stone sinks,
Down among the leaves and branches,
Brown and matted at the bottom.
On the dam stood Pau-Puk-Keewis,
O'er his ankles flowed the streamlet,
Spouted through the chinks below him,
Dashed upon the stones beneath him,
Spread serene and calm before him,
And the sunshine and the shadows
Fell in flecks and gleams upon him,
Fell in little shining patches,
Through the waving, rustling branches.
From the bottom rose the beavers,
Silently above the surface
Rose one head and then another,
Till the pond seemed full of beavers,
Full of black and shining faces.
To the beavers Pau-Puk-Keewis
Spake entreating, said in this wise:
'Very pleasant Is your dwelling,
O my friends! and safe from danger;
Can you not, with all your cunning,
All your wisdom and contrivance,
Change me, too, into a beaver?'
'Yes!' replied Ahmeek, the beaver,
He the King of all the beavers,
'Let yourself slide down among us,
Down into the tranquil water.'
Down into the pond among them
Silently sank Pau-Puk-Keewis;
Black became his shirt of deer-skin,
Black his moccasins and leggings,
In a broad black tail behind him
Spread his fox-tails and his fringes;
He was changed into a beaver.
'Make me large,' said Pau-Puk-Keewis,
'Make me large and make me larger,
Larger than the other beavers.'
'Yes,' the beaver chief responded,
'When our lodge below you enter,
In our wigwam we will make you
Ten times larger than the others.'
Thus into the clear, brown water
Silently sank Pau-Puk-Keewis:
Found the bottom covered over
With the trunks of trees and branches,
Hoards of food against the winter,
Piles and heaps against the famine;
Found the lodge with arching doorway,
Leading into spacious chambers.
Here they made him large and larger,
Made him largest of the beavers,
Ten times larger than the others.
'You shall be our ruler,' said they;
'Chief and King of all the beavers.'
But not long had Pau-Puk-Keewis
Sat in state among the beavers,
When there came a voice, of warning
From the watchman at his station
In the water-flags and lilies,
Saying, 'Here Is Hiawatha!
Hiawatha with his hunters!'
Then they heard a cry above them,
Heard a shouting and a tramping,
Heard a crashing and a rushing,
And the water round and o'er them
Sank and sucked away in eddies,
And they knew their dam was broken.
On the lodge's roof the hunters
Leaped, and broke it all asunder;
Streamed the sunshine through the crevice,
Sprang the beavers through the doorway,
Hid themselves in deeper water,
In the channel of the streamlet;
But the mighty Pau-Puk-Keewis
Could not pass beneath the doorway;
He was puffed with pride and feeding,
He was swollen like a bladder.
Through the roof looked Hiawatha,
Cried aloud, 'O Pau-Puk-Keewis
Vain are all your craft and cunning,
Vain your manifold disguises!
Well I know you, Pau-Puk-Keewis!'
With their clubs they beat and bruised him,
Beat to death poor Pau-Puk-Keewis,
Pounded him as maize is pounded,
Till his skull was crushed to pieces.
Six tall hunters, lithe and limber,
Bore him home on poles and branches,
Bore the body of the beaver;
But the ghost, the Jeebi in him,
Thought and felt as Pau-Puk-Keewis,
Still lived on as Pau-Puk-Keewis.
And it fluttered, strove, and struggled,
Waving hither, waving thither,
As the curtains of a wigwam
Struggle with their thongs of deer-skin,
When the wintry wind is blowing;
Till it drew itself together,
Till it rose up from the body,
Till it took the form and features
Of the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis
Vanishing into the forest.
But the wary Hiawatha
Saw the figure ere it vanished,
Saw the form of Pau-Puk-Keewis
Glide into the soft blue shadow
Of the pine-trees of the forest;
Toward the squares of white beyond it,
Toward an opening in the forest.
Like a wind it rushed and panted,
Bending all the boughs before it,
And behind it, as the rain comes,
Came the steps of Hiawatha.
To a lake with many islands
Came the breathless Pau-Puk-Keewis,
Where among the water-lilies
Pishnekuh, the brant, were sailing;
Through the tufts of rushes floating,
Steering through the reedy Islands.
Now their broad black beaks they lifted,
Now they plunged beneath the water,
Now they darkened in the shadow,
Now they brightened in the sunshine.
'Pishnekuh!' cried Pau-Puk-Keewis,
'Pishnekuh! my brothers!' said he,
'Change me to a brant with plumage,
With a shining neck and feathers,
Make me large, and make me larger,
Ten times larger than the others.'
Straightway to a brant they changed him,
With two huge and dusky pinions,
With a bosom smooth and rounded,
With a bill like two great paddles,
Made him larger than the others,
Ten times larger than the largest,
Just as, shouting from the forest,
On the shore stood Hiawatha.
Up they rose with cry and clamor,
With a whir and beat of pinions,
Rose up from the reedy Islands,
From the water-flags and lilies.
And they said to Pau-Puk-Keewis:
'In your flying, look not downward,
Take good heed and look not downward,
Lest some strange mischance should happen,
Lest some great mishap befall you!'
Fast and far they fled to northward,
Fast and far through mist and sunshine,
Fed among the moors and fen-lands,
Slept among the reeds and rushes.
On the morrow as they journeyed,
Buoyed and lifted by the South-wind,
Wafted onward by the South-wind,
Blowing fresh and strong behind them,
Rose a sound of human voices,
Rose a clamor from beneath them,
From the lodges of a village,
From the people miles beneath them.
For the people of the village
Saw the flock of brant with wonder,
Saw the wings of Pau-Puk-Keewis
Flapping far up in the ether,
Broader than two doorway curtains.
Pau-Puk-Keewis heard the shouting,
Knew the voice of Hiawatha,
Knew the outcry of Iagoo,
And, forgetful of the warning,
Drew his neck in, and looked downward,
And the wind that blew behind him
Caught his mighty fan of feathers,
Sent him wheeling, whirling downward!
All in vain did Pau-Puk-Keewis
Struggle to regain his balance!
Whirling round and round and downward,
He beheld in turn the village
And in turn the flock above him,
Saw the village coming nearer,
And the flock receding farther,
Heard the voices growing louder,
Heard the shouting and the laughter;
Saw no more the flocks above him,
Only saw the earth beneath him;
Dead out of the empty heaven,
Dead among the shouting people,
With a heavy sound and sullen,
Fell the brant with broken pinions.
But his soul, his ghost, his shadow,
Still survived as Pau-Puk-Keewis,
Took again the form and features
Of the handsome Yenadizze,
And again went rushing onward,
Followed fast by Hiawatha,
Crying: 'Not so wide the world is,
Not so long and rough the way Is,
But my wrath shall overtake you,
But my vengeance shall attain you!'
And so near he came, so near him,
That his hand was stretched to seize him,
His right hand to seize and hold him,
When the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis
Whirled and spun about in circles,
Fanned the air into a whirlwind,
Danced the dust and leaves about him,
And amid the whirling eddies
Sprang into a hollow oak-tree,
Changed himself into a serpent,
Gliding out through root and rubbish.
With his right hand Hiawatha
Smote amain the hollow oak-tree,
Rent it into shreds and splinters,
Left it lying there in fragments.
But in vain; for Pau-Puk-Keewis,
Once again in human figure,
Full in sight ran on before him,
Sped away in gust and whirlwind,
On the shores of Gitche Gumee,
Westward by the Big-Sea-Water,
Came unto the rocky headlands,
To the Pictured Rocks of sandstone,
Looking over lake and landscape.
And the Old Man of the Mountain,
He the Manito of Mountains,
Opened wide his rocky doorways,
Opened wide his deep abysses,
Giving Pau-Puk-Keewis shelter
In his caverns dark and dreary,
Bidding Pau-Puk-Keewis welcome
To his gloomy lodge of sandstone.
There without stood Hiawatha,
Found the doorways closed against him,
With his mittens, Minjekahwun,
Smote great caverns in the sandstone,
Cried aloud in tones of thunder,
'Open! I am Hiawatha!'
But the Old Man of the Mountain
Opened not, and made no answer
From the silent crags of sandstone,
From the gloomy rock abysses.
Then he raised his hands to heaven,
Called imploring on the tempest,
Called Waywassimo, the lightning,
And the thunder, Annemeekee;
And they came with night and darkness,
Sweeping down the Big-Sea-Water
From the distant Thunder Mountains;
And the trembling Pau-Puk-Keewis
Heard the footsteps of the thunder,
Saw the red eyes of the lightning,
Was afraid, and crouched and trembled.
Then Waywassimo, the lightning,
Smote the doorways of the caverns,
With his war-club smote the doorways,
Smote the jutting crags of sandstone,
And the thunder, Annemeekee,
Shouted down into the caverns,
Saying, 'Where is Pau-Puk-Keewis!'
And the crags fell, and beneath them
Dead among the rocky ruins
Lay the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis,
Lay the handsome Yenadizze,
Slain in his own human figure.
Ended were his wild adventures,
Ended were his tricks and gambols,
Ended all his craft and cunning,
Ended all his mischief-making,
All his gambling and his dancing,
All his wooing of the maidens.
Then the noble Hiawatha
Took his soul, his ghost, his shadow,
Spake and said: 'O Pau-Puk-Keewis,
Never more in human figure
Shall you search for new adventures'
Never more with jest and laughter
Dance the dust and leaves in whirlwinds;
But above there in the heavens
You shall soar and sail in circles;
I will change you to an eagle,
To Keneu, the great war-eagle,
Chief of all the fowls with feathers,
Chief of Hiawatha's chickens.'
And the name of Pau-Puk-Keewis
Lingers still among the people,
Lingers still among the singers,
And among the story-tellers;
And in Winter, when the snow-flakes
Whirl in eddies round the lodges,
When the wind in gusty tumult
O'er the smoke-flue pipes and whistles,
'There,' they cry, 'comes Pau-Puk-Keewis,
He is dancing through the village,
He is gathering in his harvest!'"
448,Emotion,HuntingPoemsHuntingSongOfTheSeeoneePackPoembyRudyardKipling,"As the dawn was breaking the Sambhur belled
Once, twice, and again!
And a doe leaped up -- and a doe leaped up
From the pond in the wood where the wild deer sup.
This I, scouting alone, beheld,
Once, twice, and again!
As the dawn was breaking the Sambhur belled
Once, twice, and again!
And a wolf stole back -- and a wolf stole back
To carry the word to the waiting Pack;
And we sought and we found and we bayed on his track
Once, twice, and again!
As the dawn was breaking the Wolf-pack yelled
Once, twice, and again!
Feet in the jungle that leave no mark!
Eyes that can see in the dark -- the dark!
Tongue -- give tongue to it! Hark! O Hark!
Once, twice, and again!
His spots are the joy of the Leopard: his horns are the Buffalo's pride --
Be clean, for the strength of the hunter is known by the gloss of his hide.
If ye find that the Bullock can toss you, or the heavy-browed Sambhur can gore;
Ye need not stop work to inform us; we knew it ten seasons before.
Oppress not the cubs of the stranger, but hail them as Sister and Brother,
For though they are little and fubsy, it may be the Bear is their mother.
""There is none like to me!"" says the Cub in the pride of his earliest kill;
But the Jungle is large and the Cub he is small. Let him think and be still."
449,Emotion,HuntingPoemsTheHappyHuntingGroundsPoembyEmilyPaulineJohnson,"Into the rose gold westland, its yellow prairies roll,
World of the bison's freedom, home of the Indian's soul.
Roll out, O seas! in sunlight bathed,
Your plains wind-tossed, and grass enswathed.
Farther than vision ranges, farther than eagles fly,
Stretches the land of beauty, arches the perfect sky,
Hemm'd through the purple mists afar
By peaks that gleam like star on star.
Fringing the prairie billows, fretting horizon's line,
Darkly green are slumb'ring wildernesses of pine,
Sleeping until the zephyrs throng
To kiss their silence into song.
Whispers freighted with odour swinging into the air,
Russet needles as censers swing to an altar, where
The angels' songs are less divine
Than duo sung twixt breeze and pine.
Laughing into the forest, dimples a mountain stream,
Pure as the airs above it, soft as a summer dream,
O! Lethean spring thou'rt only found
Within this ideal hunting ground.
Surely the great Hereafter cannot be more than this,
Surely we'll see that country after Time's farewell kiss.
Who would his lovely faith condole?
Who envies not the Red-skin's soul,
Sailing into the cloud land, sailing into the sun,
Into the crimson portals ajar when life is done?
O! dear dead race, my spirit too
Would fain sail westward unto you."

451,Emotion,HuntingPoemsHuntingSeasonIsOpenPoembyLindaWinchell,"Gun hunting season opens tomorrow morning
my husband is gathering his hunting gear around.
He'll be getting up really early in the morning
way before the break of dawn.
He's trying his special orange hunting cap on
so that he's not mistaken for a deer.
Us wives always worry about that you know
it is one of a hunter's wifes greatest fears.
The weather is suppose to be very cold and rainy
my husband says that is the best weather for hunting in.
Because the deer are on the move much more
then when it's warmer like some recent days have been.
I will say a prayer to our Lord above
asking that He protect all hunters, on this opening day.
And that they all come back with that Buck or Doe their after
and no bullets from their guns shot go astray."
452,Emotion,HuntingPoemsHuntingWhenInTeenPoembyRmShanmugamChettiar,"That was the age of nineteen,
The age for searching for the queen.
Many were spotted on line,
None of whom was to my design.
I sighted her on the bank
Of a tank on a dusky night,
With her two sisters to flank.
It was a temple festive feat.
She was fatter than the sisters.
She was darker than the sisters.
She only pulled me to her side
By her freshness and youngness.
Can I pull her? – A challenge,
Her formidability threw to me
To test how best I can stand
To win over a woman’s hand.
If beaten and beaten, even
A rock can be well shaken.
By repeatedly seen, the rock
Was moved. I was in peak.
I found her home and family,
Which was on my way luckily.
Her clan was just one step away.
That was the block in my way.
I won her vision every morning
And evening, from her balcony.
I won her consent in picking
My letters, thrown from bicycle.
I won her presence in a tryst
That she planned in a lone house.
With her maid, she gave audience
And urged me for an alliance.
She was there so near me as fire.
I stood there bare as tinder.
No touch, no kiss, I was perfect.
I wanted to earn her respect.
Badly I buried my lust
To stand high in her estimate.
Sadly I hurried to exit
As a noble, missing a feast.
Her stepbrother was my teacher,
A smooth friendly character.
He took my proposal as dry
And sent me out high and dry.
I can have her by inter caste;
Her child will then suffer great
To choose her a suitable mate.
Therefore, he was against my act.
She gave pose from balcony.
I got it from down below, cycling.
Twice a day, there were many.
To our love there was no blow.
Later her brother came down
From his stand and made it known
That I could get her hand
If my parents gave their hand.
That stand he should have taken
By the pressure she had given.
A clear indication of her,
That she was keen for our tie.
I averred to my revered mother
In alluded way. No use.
With no job, no money, to muster
Strength is in vain. I stood aloof.
Days rolled. There was no courage.
Study was over. Time parted us.
I cursed my cowardliness.
All ended in tragic senses.
I lost my love without guts.
I lost a bird without a hunt.
A tragic note then I wrote-
All are well that began well.
No more love had blossomed.
By now, forty years rolled.
Where is she? Whether she lives? .
To see her once is my bliss.

453,Emotion,HuntingPoemsTheCapeHuntingDogsOfAfricaPoembyFrancisDuggan,"They run for hours on end each day through grasses gray and brown
Race antelope to a stand still and drag big zebra down
Outlast the speedy wildebeest their victims die in pain
Those amazing cape hunting dogs the hunters of the plain.
They have no sense of right or wrong they must hunt to survive
And their young in den some ten miles off without fresh meat won't thrive
The cape hunting dogs of Africa don't have sins to forgive
They risk their lives amidst flying hooves they kill so they
can live.
The cape hunting dogs of Africa are creatures i admire
They chase big game for miles and miles and never seem to tire
Their team work and companionship they live to serve the pack
They often kill ten miles from home and trot the ten miles back.
The cape hunting dogs of Africa live as true family
They chase big game for miles on end and work in harmony
They have no choice but kill to eat if they don't eat they die
And they risk their lives to serve the pack when hooves of hunted fly."
454,Emotion,HuntingPoemsharichandran08TheHuntingExpeditionPoembyRajaramRamachandran,"The Sage’s unkind action
Brought a total destruction
Of lives and property
In the entire country.
As wild animals attacked,
The people were scared.
When the King asked,
His ministers replied:
“The situation is alarming.
So, we’ll go for hunting,
That’ll create a terror
And drive them out in fear.”
He immediately gave orders
To call for all the hunters.
Hunters with their spears,
Came in countless numbers.
Dogs, white, black, red,
In various colors chased.
Drummers drummed
Torch bearers followed.
Cart load of ropes,
Big nets and traps
Were carried to catch
Animals after a watch.
They took strong bows,
With plenty of arrows,
To kill wild animals
Roaming in jungles.
With Chandramathi, his consort
Harichandran went in his chariot
To hunt the wild animals
And kill the ferocious creatures,
The King’s brave soldiers
Joining with the hunters,
Chased all the animals
Deep into the jungles.
Many were trapped.
Many were killed.
They burnt jungles
Out came more animals.
Animals burned in fire.
Some ran away in fear.
Blood flowed like river.
It was a scene of horror.
With their complaints
Escaped animals went
To Viswamithra then
For his merciful action.
He created a wild pig,
That was unusually big
To defeat Harichandran,
That was his next plan.
The magical pig killed,
As many as it attacked.
To the King, hunters ran,
For their safe protection,
The king became hot.
His one arrow shot
Blew the pig out
Killing it on the spot.
The King then went
And rested in his tent.
In his sleep that night
A bad dream he dreamt.
He married in his dream
Five wives at a time,
One he gave to a hermit,
The second one ran out.
Without food that day,
The third passed away.
Her eyes, the fourth lost.
The fifth stayed till last.
Next day, he sent for
His wise chief minister,
Who explained to him
How to unfold the dream.
“It means, you’ll lose
Your kingdom, besides
Wealth, wife, and child
But win back all at the end.”
Chandramathi felt sorry,
But said, “Let us not worry
As we’ve committed no sin,
And truth shall always win."

and following of the soul by the Divine Life.
The inexorable onward sweep of this
‘Tremendous lover' is hunting the separated spirit
that flees him down the nights and down the days.
Our natural will is to have God.
The good will of God is to have us.
We may never cease from longing
till we have him in fullness of  joy.
The mystic vision is of a spiritual universe,
held tight within the bonds of love.

Where every bud with freedom swells
To meet the glorious day:
The morning breaks; again rejoice;
And with old Ringwood's well-known voice
Bid tuneful Echo play.
We come, ye Groves, ye Hills, we come:
The vagrant Fox shall hear: his doom,
And dread our jovial train.
The shrill Horn sounds, the courser flies,
While every Sportsman joyful cries,
'There's Ringwood's voice again.'
Ye Meadows, hail the coming throng;
Ye peaceful Streams that wind along,
Repeat the Hark-away:
Far o'er the Downs, ye Gales that sweep,
The daring Oak that crowns the steep,
The roaring peal convey.
The chiming notes of chearful Hounds,
Hark! how the hollow Dale resounds;
The sunny Hills how gay.
But where's the note, brave Dog, like thine?
Then urge the Steed, the chorus join,
'Tis Ringwood leads the way."
458,Emotion,HuntingPoemsDeerHuntingPoembyRandyJohnson,"(This is a fictional poem)
When my friend and I went deer hunting, I accidentally shot a doe.
If you're wondering if I got away with it, the answer is no.
It was a bad day for me to lose my glasses.
The game warden saw us and he kicked our asses.
We got the crap beat out of us even though it was two against one.
After beating us to a bloody pulp, he put a second hole in our butts with my gun.
We had to sleep on our stomachs for weeks, it was terrible to go through.
We went through all of that misery and we didn't even get some damn venison stew."
459,Emotion,HuntingPoemsRabbitHuntingPoembyRajThampi,"Kudos to a failed hunting
The net was laid perfect
No chances for a rabbit to escape
The expertise of an experienced
Hunter and his flesh lust
I waited
And she ran into the trap
My favorite snow white rabbit
“Oh not again” I heard her uttering in dismay
And she wore the gestures of horror and disbelief
Smoke stained lips and teeth
Forming into an loathsome grin
I snorted “I want your flesh”
Caressing the barrel of my favorite gun
“Go eat your deer” spreading her eyes for
An escape she yelled back
“I am tired of vegetables”
Penetrating the gum gaps with toothpick
I replied her quite bored
“You had your share of my flesh…many times…”
I saw her eyes flowing helplessness
“I don’t care…I want I want to taste your tender flesh
And the warmth of your blood”
I aimed my gun at her
A moment’s silence
She leaped and disappeared
Into the large snake hole, I missed
Cussing violent and mad
Caused by an unexpected failure
I wrapped the net neat into its case
And returned home
I ate my deer
I was hungry
I slept snoring
I was tired from hunting and eating
Vegetable."

For the wet winds blow;
There's winter in the air,
And autumn all below.
For the red leaves are flying
And the red bracken dying,
And the red fox lying
Where the oziers grow.
Put the bridle on the mare,
For my blood runs chill;
And my heart, it is there,
On the heather-tufted hill,
With the gray skies o'er us,
And the long-drawn chorus
Of a running pack before us
From the find to the kill.
Then lead round the mare,
For it's time that we began,
And away with thought and care,
Save to live and be a man,
While the keen air is blowing,
And the huntsman holloing,
And the black mare going
As the black mare can."
462,Emotion,HuntingPoemsHuntingOnBelleayreMountainPoembyEugeneLevich,"Snow last night
Early this year
Flakes still flutter
White drifts four feet deep.
Deep powder,
Feathery stuff,
So cold so dry
You see the six points on every flake
Each unique
I climb straight up the mountain
Before dawn
On the mountain's other side,
Away from ski lodge and trails.
No sound heard.
But my boots shuffling shuffling
Through snow
Up to my knees
Sunlight awakens the world
Dawn
I keep moving... one hour... then two.
The trees... leaves mostly fallen
Others still hanging, yellow or red
What are they?
Maple, ash, and oak,
Hemlock, poplar, some kind of pine
Fifteenth birthday last July
First hunt
All alone
Totally clueless
Delighted to be where I am.
Stop... eat some jerky and an apple
Drink some tea
Then go on, ever up and up.
Young... I think I can climb forever.
But I stop next to a wild apple tree
And suddenly!
Listen... what is that?
It's like whispering, whispering, whispering
In my ear
It is deer moving through the powdery snow
Whisper, whisper, whisper
I hear them from far away
They come in a line.  No antlers.
All does.  My.35 is up
Sighted in the day before
Waiting for the buck
Stunningly beautiful scenery,
High up on Belleayre Mountain
Watching those does, six—no seven of them
Gracefully moving through the snow
All in a line
And they don't see me
Don't catch my scent
Air too dry
They pass so close
I could reach my carbine out
And touch them with its tip.
CRASH in the tree line
Just above me...
Hundred yards away
A great antlered buck and a white tail
Disappearing in the flash of an eye
No fool he...That wise old buck!
My heart is beating fast as a rabbit
Tapping its paw
I couldn't take that buck
But I don't care.
I could never have even gotten him
Down from there, anyway
If I had shot him
But I don't care.
I'm glad he's alive and free
Just like me.
One of the most
Beautiful days of my life
Hunting up on Belleayre Mountain
Near Margaretville
Just those deer, the snow,
The trees, the sun,
The mountain, and me."
463,Emotion,HuntingPoemsHuntingOrFishingPoembyRameshTA,"Hunting or fishing – which is better?
That is what I am thinking about!
In business many hunt for customers;
Some men prefer casting net to catch fish!
Even for poets the position is the same
In poetry websites to catch readers!
Some lay wise traps to catch readers!
I use fishing rod with a needle and bait
To catch readers who can understand!
Whether the rank is high or low it is
Immaterial but the true comment is!
Hunting readers to comment and rank
Or fishing readers to comment and rank
Are not really going to enhance one’s status;
For, voluntary comments are indeed valuable!
Poets are jealous to appreciate others’ merit
But some poets raise the status of others!
So, letters to such poets increase sans end!
This is the status of poetry websites now!
So, it is left to you to hunt or fish or lay trap
As you wish to catch readers for rank, etc.!"

And deer is your main prey
Wear bright colors, so you wont get stuck
Taking your life away
When sitting in a tree stand
Or walking along with others
Make sure what you see is not a man
Waiting for deer in a gutter
Safety is the most important thing
When hunting with a bow or a gun
A terrible tragedy they can bring
When using them just for fun
So take my advise and play it safe
Hunting is not a game
Take your time, it's not a race
The results will still be the same"

Always on mini-skirts in the street
My dressing hides nothing secret
I contemplate love for a kob
Where I hunt them like a cub
Everybody likes me, they lust me
I touch clouds, I thought they love me
He left me, he left and so they kept on
I can't recognise my mistakes
And they can't tell me
They don't love me

469,Emotion,HuntingPoemsFitTheThirdHuntingOfTheSnarkPoembyLewisCarroll,"The Baker's Tale
They roused him with muffins--they roused him with ice--
They roused him with mustard and cress--
They roused him with jam and judicious advice--
They set him conundrums to guess.
When at length he sat up and was able to speak,
His sad story he offered to tell;
And the Bellman cried ""Silence! Not even a shriek!""
And excitedly tingled his bell.
There was silence supreme! Not a shriek, not a scream,
Scarcely even a howl or a groan,
As the man they called ""Ho!"" told his story of woe
In an antediluvian tone.
""My father and mother were honest, though poor--""
""Skip all that!"" cried the Bellman in haste.
""If it once becomes dark, there's no chance of a Snark--
We have hardly a minute to waste!""
""I skip forty years,"" said the Baker in tears,
""And proceed without further remark
To the day when you took me aboard of your ship
To help you in hunting the Snark.
""A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was named)
Remarked, when I bade him farewell--""
""Oh, skip your dear uncle!"" the Bellman exclaimed,
As he angrily tingled his bell.
""He remarked to me then,"" said that mildest of men,
""'If your Snark be a Snark, that is right:
Fetch it home by all means--you may serve it with greens
And it's handy for striking a light.
""'You may seek it with thimbles--and seek it with care--
You may hunt it with forks and hope;
You may threaten its life with a railway-share;
You may charm it with smiles and soap--'""
(""That's exactly the method,"" the Bellman bold
In a hasty parenthesis cried,
""That's exactly the way I have always been told
That the capture of Snarks should be tried!"")
""'But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day,
If your Snark be a Boojum! For then
You will softly and suddenly vanish away,
And never be met with again!""
""It is this, it is this that oppresses my soul,
When I think of my uncle's last words:
And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl
Brimming over with quivering curds!
""It is this, it is this--"" ""We have had that before!""
The Bellman indignantly said.
And the Baker replied ""Let me say it once more.
It is this, it is this that I dread!
""I engage with the Snark--every night after dark--
In a dreamy delirious fight:
I serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes,
And I use it for striking a light:
""But if ever I meet with a Boojum, that day,
In a moment (of this I am sure),
I shall softly and suddenly vanish away--
And the notion I cannot endure!"""

471,Emotion,HuntingPoemsHuntingHornsPoembyGuillaumeApollinaire,"Our story’s noble as its tragic
like the grimace of a tyrant
no drama’s chance or magic
no detail that’s indifferent
makes our great love pathetic
And Thomas de Quincey drinking
Opiate poison sweet and chaste
Of his poor Anne went dreaming
We pass we pass since all must pass
Often I’ll be returning
Memories are hunting horns alas
whose note along the wind is dying"
472,Emotion,HuntingPoemsHuntingAndPeckingPoembyGeorgeHunter,"When I was little and it was a rainy day,
My Mom wouldn’t let me go out to play.
Said I had to stay in or I’d get a cold,
And wouldn’t be able to grow real old.
Wouldn’t be able to enjoy all those years
And spend a lifetime in this vale of tears.
So I’d pester, “What can I do
If I can’t go out to play? ”
And if it wasn’t raining, she’d say,
“Go out and play on the new free way.”
Or my Dad would say, it was his stock,
“Go take a run around the block.”
My Mom, always wanting to be fair
But also wanting me outta her hair
Would suggest,
“Go type on that old Remington machine,
We’ve had that thing since the Pliestocene.”
So I’d get out Dad’s books that had a nice rhyme
And the rest of the day I’d spend my time
Typing some poet that I thought was mellow
My favorite being H. W. Longfellow.
I visualized the smithy and his chestnut tree
Pounding his anvil for all to see.
I never learned to type, but What the Hey!
I’d hunt and peck all through the day.
Later I learned I wasn’t alone on a raft
‘Cause a lot of others hadn’t learned that craft.
That’s why so many young stenos are such home wreckers,
It’s because most of them are huntin’ peckers"
473,Emotion,HuntingPoemsDeerHuntingTimeIsHereAgainPoembyKathleenWest,"Deer hunting time is here again
And many hunters take to the woods
After months of planning with family and friends
They gather in common brotherhood
It's a freedom that fills the soul of a man
With the peace of God's nature all around
Lessons that have been taught since time began
And lifelong memories and friendships are found
Hunting is taught by tradition still yet
Knowledge passed on from man to man
And you'll learn things that you'll never forget
And respect nature more, our wildlife, and our land
So all you hunters enjoy this time
May you be skilled and have lots of luck
May God bless you as you hunt today
And may you bag that ten point buck! !
Dedicated to my Father who enjoyed hunting with family and friends all of his life.  He died of a heart attack on the opening day, while hunting with my brothers and uncles.  He could not have asked for a better way to go, doing what he loved most!"
474,Emotion,HuntingPoemsTheIslandHuntingSongPoembyOliverWendellHolmes,"No more the summer floweret charms,
The leaves will soon be sere,
And Autumn folds his jewelled arms
Around the dying year;
So, ere the waning seasons claim
Our leafless groves awhile,
With golden wine and glowing flame
We â€™ll crown our lonely isle.
Once more the merry voices sound
Within the antlered hall,
And long and loud the baying hounds
Return the hunterâ€™s call;
And through the woods, and oâ€™er the hill,
And far along the bay,
The driverâ€™s horn is sounding shrill,â€”Â­
Up, sportsmen, and away!
No bars of steel or walls of stone
Our little empire bound,
But, circling with his azure zone,
The sea runs foaming round;
The whitening wave, the purpled skies,
The blue and lifted shore,
Braid with their dim and blending dyes
Our wide horizon oâ€™er.
And who will leave the grave debate
That shakes the smoky town,
To rule amid our island-state,
And wear our oak-leaf crown?
And who will be awhile content
To hunt our woodland game,
And leave the vulgar pack that scent
The reeking track of fame?
Ah, who that shares in toils like these
Will sigh not to prolong
Our days beneath the broad-leaved trees,
Our nights of mirth and song?
Then leave the dust of noisy streets,
Ye outlaws of the wood,
And follow through his green retreats
Your noble Robin Hood."

477,Emotion,HuntingPoemsLouseHuntingPoembyIsaacRosenberg,"Nudes -- stark and glistening,
Yelling in lurid glee. Grinning faces
And raging limbs
Whirl over the floor one fire.
For a shirt verminously busy
Yon soldier tore from his throat, with oaths
Godhead might shrink at, but not the lice.
And soon the shirt was aflare
Over the candle he'd lit while we lay.
Then we all sprang up and stript
To hunt the verminous brood.
Soon like a demons' pantomine
The place was raging.
See the silhouettes agape,
See the glibbering shadows
Mixed with the battled arms on the wall.
See gargantuan hooked fingers
Pluck in supreme flesh
To smutch supreme littleness.
See the merry limbs in hot Highland fling
Because some wizard vermin
Charmed from the quiet this revel
When our ears were half lulled
By the dark music
Blown from Sleep's trumpet."
478,Emotion,HuntingPoemsWhyDeerHuntingIsSpecialToMePoembyRogerHorsch,"It seems like we thrive from the adrenaline flow
While hunting the morning of the very first snow.
For all the mornings that we practically froze
When we can't feel our fingers, or the tips of our toes.
Yet, we still hunt day after day
In anticipation of the moment we can finally say
'I GOT A DEER' with a cheerful shout.
As we jump up and down and run all about.
We think it's skill, but it's mostly luck
That feeling we get when we get our first buck.
When we talk about the hunt, or the antler size
No one knows the real truth, 'cause everyone lies.
It's remembering our first hunt, as a girl or a boy
When we felt the excitement with a heart full of joy.
It's the fun that we have with our family and friends.
It's the sharing and experience that we hope never ends.
So, go deer hunting...just do it some day
Then you might understand what I'm trying to say.
Hunting deer is special to me
So, try it sometime and you'll find out and see."
479,Emotion,HuntingPoemsHuntingMemoryPoembyBarryMiddleton,"In my youth I was a hunter.
As age advances, I hunt for memory.
I remember planting flowers by the front steps,
just old enough to dig with a spoon.
I planted nasturtiums and was amazed at the riot of color as that grew.
I knew then I wanted to grow things.
I remember the garden gate I built at seven and how
my mother bragged on its durability all her life.
I knew then I wanted to build things.
I remember painting the kitchen and the smell of the glossy oil paint.
I remember the dogwood in bloom in an upper valley.
I remember roaming, searching; I remember beech trees, and the stillness of the woods before my eye caught the movement of a squirrel.
I remember the jeweled rocks in our rippling creek.
I remember home, the garden patch, apple picking,
the cool fall air, the first frost, cedar Christmas trees
and priceless winters when southern snow blew in from the west.
I remember the first daffodils of spring.
All childhood is intact, all of my life stored in memory.
I remember love and love lost,
and found and lost again.
I remember joy and pain, grief and new hope.
For now the monster of forgetting is at bay.
I can remember.
I can hunt, I can find, all time not yet lost."
480,Emotion,HuntingPoemsGoingHuntingPoembyWojjaFink,"Going hunting for some poets
The ones with bite and teeth
And when I find their tracks
I’ll rest a while beneath
And let their understanding
Sink deep into my bones
It could be from Mr.Homer
Or that man Mr. Jones.
And when I’ve caught a posse
Of ten maybe a score
I’ll stand them to attention
And sing them loud a loud Ohm’s law
Then we’ll sail a sailing galleon
And roam the seven seas
With thunder in the main sail
We’ll make good time with ease
With Mr. Ohm as  Captain
We’ll seek the devils lair
And blind him in the light
And drag him by his hair
We’ll bury him far at sea
In fathoms blue and deep
And when he’s laid to rest
We won’t lose a wink of sleep
We won’t need a.45
Or blood upon a sword
And if I end up in court
I’ll plead 'guilty yes my Lord',
We took his ghostly fashion
And buried it deep at sea
So one more of your hearts
Shall ever more be free
For when we cast him out
Into the watery deep
Not a single poet amongst us
Did stand there and did weep
For they all know with reason
Just where the devil hides
In the shadows of illusion
Where selfishness resides
So Sir we all plead guilty
And would do it yet again
To free one more Soul from sorrow
From the devil’s heartless reign."
481,Emotion,HuntingPoemsPrefaceToHuntingOfTheSnarkPoembyLewisCarroll,"PREFACE
If---and the thing is wildly possible---the charge of writing
nonsense were ever brought against the author of this brief but
instructive poem, it would be based, I feel convinced, on the line
``Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes''
In view of this painful possibility, I will not (as I might) appeal
indignantly to my other writings as a proof that I am incapable of
such a deed: I will not (as I might) point to the strong moral
purpose of this poem itself, to the arithmetical principles so
cautiously inculcated in it, or to its noble teachings in Natural
History---I will take the more prosaic course of simply explaining
how it happened.
The Bellman, who was almost morbidly sensitive about appearances,
used to have the bowsprit unshipped once or twice a week to be
revarnished, and it more than once happened, when the time came for
replacing it, that no one on board could remember which end of the
ship it belonged to. They knew it was not of the slightest use to
appeal to the Bellman about it---he would only refer to his Naval
Code, and read out in pathetic tones Admiralty Instructions which
none of them had ever been able to understand---so it generally ended
in its being fastened on, anyhow, across the rudder. The helmsman
used to stand by with tears in his eyes: he knew it was all wrong,
but alas! Rule 42 of the Code, ``No one shall speak to the Man at the
Helm'', had been completed by the Bellman himself with the words
``and the Man at the Helm shall speak to no one''. So remonstrance
was impossible, and no steering could be done till the next
varnishing day. During these bewildering intervals the ship usually
sailed backwards.
This office was usually undertaken by the Boots, who found in it
a refuge from the Baker's constant complaints about the insufficient
blacking of his three pairs of boots.
As this poem is to some extent connected with the lay of the
Jabberwock, let me take this opportunity of answering a question that
has often been asked me, how to pronounce ``slithy toves''. The
``i'' in ``slithy'' is long, as in ``writhe''; and ``toves'' is
pronounced so as to rhyme with ``groves''. Again, the first ``o'' in
``borogoves'' is pronounced like the ``o'' in ``borrow''. I have
heard people try to give it the sound of the ``o'' in ``worry''.
Such is Human Perversity.
This also seems a fitting occasion to notice the other hard words in
that poem. Humpty-Dumpty's theory, of two meanings packed into one
word like a portmanteau, seems to me the right explanation for all.
For instance, take the two words ``fuming'' and ``furious''. Make up
your mind that you will say both words, but leave it unsettled which
you will say first. Now open your mouth and speak. If your thoughts
incline ever so little towards ``fuming'', you will say
``fuming-furious''; if they turn, by even a hair's breadth, towards
``furious'', you will say ``furious-fuming''; but if you have that
rarest of gifts, a perfectly balanced mind, you will say
``frumious''.
Supposing that, when Pistol uttered the well-known words---
``Under which king, Bezonian? Speak or die!''
Justice Shallow had felt certain that it was either William or
Richard, but had not been able to settle which, so that he could not
possibly say either name before the other, can it be doubted that,
rather than die, he would have gasped out ``Rilchiam!''.

482,Emotion,HuntingPoems6TheHuntingTripPoembyMaryNagy,"Daddy went hunting.
Mamma went too.
Daddy got a deer,
but Mamma got two.
Mamma told her story
while Daddy stood by
looking like at any time
he was gonna cry.
We all thought ''He's jealous
he only got one.''
But, Daddy had a reason
he didn't shoot his gun.
The buck was at his blind.
He seen him at close range.
The path was clear and all at once
Daddy felt something strange.
He knew that she was waiting
over in her stand.
He had bagged so many deer.
Her fate was in his hands.
He tossed a stick to scare the deer.
He sat and watched it run.
He prayed she wouldn't miss her shot
(OR HER HUNTING DAYS WERE DONE!)
He sat patiently waiting
for the gunshot near her stand.
When he heard her yell ''I GOT ONE! ''
he finally unclenched his hands.
The deer was his gift to her
although she never knew,
why Daddy only got one deer
and she got two."
483,Emotion,HuntingPoemsDuckHuntingPoembyDwayneBailey,"Pitch black outside, ten below zero,
Man I am freezing cold;
My age is starting to creep up on me,
and boy am I feeling old.
But as the sky starts to lighten,
once black starts to turn blue;
My heart starts to beat a little faster,
my energy and strength are renewed.
Then I see the ducks in the distance,
take off for their morning flight;
I no longer notice the cold,
as I keep the ducks in my sight.
Slowly I start to call,
I see the ducks look my way;
Their checkin out my decoy spread,
and the safety that is displayed.
They circle once, they circle twice,
Then I see them cup their wings;
They are going to try and land,
oh what happiness this brings.
Ten feet or so from the water,
just before they land;
I bring my shotgun to my shoulder,
and steady it with my hands;
I squeeze the trigger slowly,
and let my steel shot fly;
My aim is true, my shot is perfect,
I watch the ducks fall from the sky."
484,Emotion,HuntingPoemsFitTheSeventhHuntingOfTheSnarkPoembyLewisCarroll,"The Banker's Fate
They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
They pursued it with forks and hope;
They threatened its life with a railway-share;
They charmed it with smiles and soap.
And the Banker, inspired with a courage so new
It was matter for general remark,
Rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view
In his zeal to discover the Snark.
But while he was seeking with thimbles and care,
A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh
And grabbed at the Banker, who shrieked in despair,
For he knew it was useless to fly.
He offered large discount--he offered a cheque
(Drawn ""to bearer"") for seven-pounds-ten:
But the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck
And grabbed at the Banker again.
Without rest or pause--while those frumious jaws
Went savagely snapping around--
He skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped,
Till fainting he fell to the ground.
The Bandersnatch fled as the others appeared
Led on by that fear-stricken yell:
And the Bellman remarked ""It is just as I feared!""
And solemnly tolled on his bell.
He was black in the face, and they scarcely could trace
The least likeness to what he had been:
While so great was the fright that his waistcoat turned white--
A wonderful thing to be seen!
To the horror of all who were present that day,
He uprose in full evening dress,
And with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say
What his tongue could no longer express.
Down he sank in a chair--ran his hands through his hair--
And chanted in mimsiest tones
Words whose utter inanity proved his insanity,
While he rattled a couple of bones.
""Leave him here to his fate--it is getting so late!""
The Bellman exclaimed in a fright.
""We have lost half a day. Any further delay,
And we sha'n't catch a Snark before night!"""
485,Emotion,HuntingPoemsHuntingWidowPoembyMarilynLott,"Well he’s gone and I gotta tell ya
It seems eerie here alone
I kind of miss his presence
After all, I’m not made of stone
The sound of his voice ramblin’
Isn’t droning in my ear
Subjects that I don’t care about
That he feels he needs to share
I’m kind of missing him, gotta say
Like the sight of summer flowers
But I guess I can’t miss him too much
For he’s been gone for just two hours!"

487,Emotion,HuntingPoemsTheHuntingPartyPoembyGertStrydom,"One weekend a hunting party
comes together on Serfaas Lourens’s farm
and they consist out of family, friends
and town folk:
two teachers, the school principal,
a lawyer, a visiting advocate and magistrate.
The group is dressed in hunting clothes
and with four by four pickups they drive
through the open veldt
past the stream with the blue gum trees.
Guinea fowl and pheasants fly up into the air,
the vehicles brake in a cloud of dust
while hunter after hunter jumps down
with shotgun upon shotgun blasting into the air.
The son of Serfaas Lourens
is shooting with a ELG-12 bore
with red LG cartridges, as if
he wants to teach the older men something
but they find only pieces
of his guinea fowl
and with the trip back
Serfaas Lourens reprimands him
all the way to the homestead
to use the right ammunition."
488,Emotion,HuntingPoemsTheHuntingOfPauPukKeewisPoembyHenryWadsworthLongfellow,"Full of wrath was Hiawatha
When he came into the village,
Found the people in confusion,
Heard of all the misdemeanors,
All the malice and the mischief,
Of the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis.
Hard his breath came through his nostrils,
Through his teeth he buzzed and muttered
Words of anger and resentment,
Hot and humming, like a hornet.
""I will slay this Pau-Puk-Keewis,
Slay this mischief-maker!"" said he.
""Not so long and wide the world is,
Not so rude and rough the way is,
That my wrath shall not attain him,
That my vengeance shall not reach him!""
Then in swift pursuit departed
Hiawatha and the hunters
On the trail of Pau-Puk-Keewis,
Through the forest, where he passed it,
To the headlands where he rested;
But they found not Pau-Puk-Keewis,
Only in the trampled grasses,
In the whortleberry-bushes,
Found the couch where he had rested,
Found the impress of his body.
From the lowlands far beneath them,
From the Muskoday, the meadow,
Pau-Puk-Keewis, turning backward,
Made a gesture of defiance,
Made a gesture of derision;
And aloud cried Hiawatha,
From the summit of the mountains:
""Not so long and wide the world is,
Not so rude and rough the way is,
But my wrath shall overtake you,
And my vengeance shall attain you!""
Over rock and over river,
Through bush, and brake, and forest,
Ran the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis;
Like an antelope he bounded,
Till he came unto a streamlet
In the middle of the forest,
To a streamlet still and tranquil,
That had overflowed its margin,
To a dam made by the beavers,
To a pond of quiet water,
Where knee-deep the trees were standing,
Where the water lilies floated,
Where the rushes waved and whispered.
On the dam stood Pau-Puk-Keewis,
On the dam of trunks and branches,
Through whose chinks the water spouted,
O'er whose summit flowed the streamlet.
From the bottom rose the beaver,
Looked with two great eyes of wonder,
Eyes that seemed to ask a question,
At the stranger, Pau-Puk-Keewis.
On the dam stood Pau-Puk-Keewis,
O'er his ankles flowed the streamlet,
Flowed the bright and silvery water,
And he spake unto the beaver,
With a smile he spake in this wise:
""O my friend Ahmeek, the beaver,
Cool and pleasant Is the water;
Let me dive into the water,
Let me rest there in your lodges;
Change me, too, into a beaver!""
Cautiously replied the beaver,
With reserve he thus made answer:
""Let me first consult the others,
Let me ask the other beavers.""
Down he sank into the water,
Heavily sank he, as a stone sinks,
Down among the leaves and branches,
Brown and matted at the bottom.
On the dam stood Pau-Puk-Keewis,
O'er his ankles flowed the streamlet,
Spouted through the chinks below him,
Dashed upon the stones beneath him,
Spread serene and calm before him,
And the sunshine and the shadows
Fell in flecks and gleams upon him,
Fell in little shining patches,
Through the waving, rustling branches.
From the bottom rose the beavers,
Silently above the surface
Rose one head and then another,
Till the pond seemed full of beavers,
Full of black and shining faces.
To the beavers Pau-Puk-Keewis
Spake entreating, said in this wise:
""Very pleasant Is your dwelling,
O my friends! and safe from danger;
Can you not, with all your cunning,
All your wisdom and contrivance,
Change me, too, into a beaver?""
""Yes!"" replied Ahmeek, the beaver,
He the King of all the beavers,
""Let yourself slide down among us,
Down into the tranquil water.""
Down into the pond among them
Silently sank Pau-Puk-Keewis;
Black became his shirt of deer-skin,
Black his moccasins and leggings,
In a broad black tail behind him
Spread his fox-tails and his fringes;
He was changed into a beaver.
""Make me large,"" said Pau-Puk-Keewis,
""Make me large and make me larger,
Larger than the other beavers.""
""Yes,"" the beaver chief responded,
""When our lodge below you enter,
In our wigwam we will make you
Ten times larger than the others.""
Thus into the clear, brown water
Silently sank Pau-Puk-Keewis:
Found the bottom covered over
With the trunks of trees and branches,
Hoards of food against the winter,
Piles and heaps against the famine;
Found the lodge with arching doorway,
Leading into spacious chambers.
Here they made him large and larger,
Made him largest of the beavers,
Ten times larger than the others.
""You shall be our ruler,"" said they;
""Chief and King of all the beavers.""
But not long had Pau-Puk-Keewis
Sat in state among the beavers,
When there came a voice, of warning
From the watchman at his station
In the water-flags and lilies,
Saying, ""Here Is Hiawatha!
Hiawatha with his hunters!""
Then they heard a cry above them,
Heard a shouting and a tramping,
Heard a crashing and a rushing,
And the water round and o'er them
Sank and sucked away in eddies,
And they knew their dam was broken.
On the lodge's roof the hunters
Leaped, and broke it all asunder;
Streamed the sunshine through the crevice,
Sprang the beavers through the doorway,
Hid themselves in deeper water,
In the channel of the streamlet;
But the mighty Pau-Puk-Keewis
Could not pass beneath the doorway;
He was puffed with pride and feeding,
He was swollen like a bladder.
Through the roof looked Hiawatha,
Cried aloud, ""O Pau-Puk-Keewis
Vain are all your craft and cunning,
Vain your manifold disguises!
Well I know you, Pau-Puk-Keewis!""
With their clubs they beat and bruised him,
Beat to death poor Pau-Puk-Keewis,
Pounded him as maize is pounded,
Till his skull was crushed to pieces.
Six tall hunters, lithe and limber,
Bore him home on poles and branches,
Bore the body of the beaver;
But the ghost, the Jeebi in him,
Thought and felt as Pau-Puk-Keewis,
Still lived on as Pau-Puk-Keewis.
And it fluttered, strove, and struggled,
Waving hither, waving thither,
As the curtains of a wigwam
Struggle with their thongs of deer-skin,
When the wintry wind is blowing;
Till it drew itself together,
Till it rose up from the body,
Till it took the form and features
Of the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis
Vanishing into the forest.
But the wary Hiawatha
Saw the figure ere it vanished,
Saw the form of Pau-Puk-Keewis
Glide into the soft blue shadow
Of the pine-trees of the forest;
Toward the squares of white beyond it,
Toward an opening in the forest.
Like a wind it rushed and panted,
Bending all the boughs before it,
And behind it, as the rain comes,
Came the steps of Hiawatha.
To a lake with many islands
Came the breathless Pau-Puk-Keewis,
Where among the water-lilies
Pishnekuh, the brant, were sailing;
Through the tufts of rushes floating,
Steering through the reedy Islands.
Now their broad black beaks they lifted,
Now they plunged beneath the water,
Now they darkened in the shadow,
Now they brightened in the sunshine.
""Pishnekuh!"" cried Pau-Puk-Keewis,
""Pishnekuh! my brothers!"" said he,
""Change me to a brant with plumage,
With a shining neck and feathers,
Make me large, and make me larger,
Ten times larger than the others.""
Straightway to a brant they changed him,
With two huge and dusky pinions,
With a bosom smooth and rounded,
With a bill like two great paddles,
Made him larger than the others,
Ten times larger than the largest,
Just as, shouting from the forest,
On the shore stood Hiawatha.
Up they rose with cry and clamor,
With a whir and beat of pinions,
Rose up from the reedy Islands,
From the water-flags and lilies.
And they said to Pau-Puk-Keewis:
""In your flying, look not downward,
Take good heed and look not downward,
Lest some strange mischance should happen,
Lest some great mishap befall you!""
Fast and far they fled to northward,
Fast and far through mist and sunshine,
Fed among the moors and fen-lands,
Slept among the reeds and rushes.
On the morrow as they journeyed,
Buoyed and lifted by the South-wind,
Wafted onward by the South-wind,
Blowing fresh and strong behind them,
Rose a sound of human voices,
Rose a clamor from beneath them,
From the lodges of a village,
From the people miles beneath them.
For the people of the village
Saw the flock of brant with wonder,
Saw the wings of Pau-Puk-Keewis
Flapping far up in the ether,
Broader than two doorway curtains.
Pau-Puk-Keewis heard the shouting,
Knew the voice of Hiawatha,
Knew the outcry of Iagoo,
And, forgetful of the warning,
Drew his neck in, and looked downward,
And the wind that blew behind him
Caught his mighty fan of feathers,
Sent him wheeling, whirling downward!
All in vain did Pau-Puk-Keewis
Struggle to regain his balance!
Whirling round and round and downward,
He beheld in turn the village
And in turn the flock above him,
Saw the village coming nearer,
And the flock receding farther,
Heard the voices growing louder,
Heard the shouting and the laughter;
Saw no more the flocks above him,
Only saw the earth beneath him;
Dead out of the empty heaven,
Dead among the shouting people,
With a heavy sound and sullen,
Fell the brant with broken pinions.
But his soul, his ghost, his shadow,
Still survived as Pau-Puk-Keewis,
Took again the form and features
Of the handsome Yenadizze,
And again went rushing onward,
Followed fast by Hiawatha,
Crying: ""Not so wide the world is,
Not so long and rough the way Is,
But my wrath shall overtake you,
But my vengeance shall attain you!""
And so near he came, so near him,
That his hand was stretched to seize him,
His right hand to seize and hold him,
When the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis
Whirled and spun about in circles,
Fanned the air into a whirlwind,
Danced the dust and leaves about him,
And amid the whirling eddies
Sprang into a hollow oak-tree,
Changed himself into a serpent,
Gliding out through root and rubbish.
With his right hand Hiawatha
Smote amain the hollow oak-tree,
Rent it into shreds and splinters,
Left it lying there in fragments.
But in vain; for Pau-Puk-Keewis,
Once again in human figure,
Full in sight ran on before him,
Sped away in gust and whirlwind,
On the shores of Gitche Gumee,
Westward by the Big-Sea-Water,
Came unto the rocky headlands,
To the Pictured Rocks of sandstone,
Looking over lake and landscape.
And the Old Man of the Mountain,
He the Manito of Mountains,
Opened wide his rocky doorways,
Opened wide his deep abysses,
Giving Pau-Puk-Keewis shelter
In his caverns dark and dreary,
Bidding Pau-Puk-Keewis welcome
To his gloomy lodge of sandstone.
There without stood Hiawatha,
Found the doorways closed against him,
With his mittens, Minjekahwun,
Smote great caverns in the sandstone,
Cried aloud in tones of thunder,
""Open! I am Hiawatha!""
But the Old Man of the Mountain
Opened not, and made no answer
From the silent crags of sandstone,
From the gloomy rock abysses.
Then he raised his hands to heaven,
Called imploring on the tempest,
Called Waywassimo, the lightning,
And the thunder, Annemeekee;
And they came with night and darkness,
Sweeping down the Big-Sea-Water
From the distant Thunder Mountains;
And the trembling Pau-Puk-Keewis
Heard the footsteps of the thunder,
Saw the red eyes of the lightning,
Was afraid, and crouched and trembled.
Then Waywassimo, the lightning,
Smote the doorways of the caverns,
With his war-club smote the doorways,
Smote the jutting crags of sandstone,
And the thunder, Annemeekee,
Shouted down into the caverns,
Saying, ""Where is Pau-Puk-Keewis!""
And the crags fell, and beneath them
Dead among the rocky ruins
Lay the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis,
Lay the handsome Yenadizze,
Slain in his own human figure.
Ended were his wild adventures,
Ended were his tricks and gambols,
Ended all his craft and cunning,
Ended all his mischief-making,
All his gambling and his dancing,
All his wooing of the maidens.
Then the noble Hiawatha
Took his soul, his ghost, his shadow,
Spake and said: ""O Pau-Puk-Keewis,
Never more in human figure
Shall you search for new adventures'
Never more with jest and laughter
Dance the dust and leaves in whirlwinds;
But above there in the heavens
You shall soar and sail in circles;
I will change you to an eagle,
To Keneu, the great war-eagle,
Chief of all the fowls with feathers,
Chief of Hiawatha's chickens.""
And the name of Pau-Puk-Keewis
Lingers still among the people,
Lingers still among the singers,
And among the story-tellers;
And in Winter, when the snow-flakes
Whirl in eddies round the lodges,
When the wind in gusty tumult
O'er the smoke-flue pipes and whistles,
""There,"" they cry, ""comes Pau-Puk-Keewis,
He is dancing through the village,
He is gathering in his harvest!"""

Afford the RENT

The quiet cabin of your heart."
490,Emotion,HuntingPoemsFitTheFifthHuntingOfTheSnarkPoembyLewisCarroll,"The Beaver's Lesson
They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
They pursued it with forks and hope;
They threatened its life with a railway-share;
They charmed it with smiles and soap.
Then the Butcher contrived an ingenious plan
For making a separate sally;
And fixed on a spot unfrequented by man,
A dismal and desolate valley.
But the very same plan to the Beaver occurred:
It had chosen the very same place:
Yet neither betrayed, by a sign or a word,
The disgust that appeared in his face.
Each thought he was thinking of nothing but ""Snark""
And the glorious work of the day;
And each tried to pretend that he did not remark
That the other was going that way.
But the valley grew narrow and narrower still,
And the evening got darker and colder,
Till (merely from nervousness, not from goodwill)
They marched along shoulder to shoulder.
Then a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky,
And they knew that some danger was near:
The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail,
And even the Butcher felt queer.
He thought of his childhood, left far far behind--
That blissful and innocent state--
The sound so exactly recalled to his mind
A pencil that squeaks on a slate!
""'Tis the voice of the Jubjub!"" he suddenly cried.
(This man, that they used to call ""Dunce."")
""As the Bellman would tell you,"" he added with pride,
""I have uttered that sentiment once.
""'Tis the note of the Jubjub! Keep count, I entreat;
You will find I have told it you twice.
'Tis the song of the Jubjub! The proof is complete,
If only I've stated it thrice.""
The Beaver had counted with scrupulous care,
Attending to every word:
But it fairly lost heart, and outgrabe in despair,
When the third repetition occurred.
It felt that, in spite of all possible pains,
It had somehow contrived to lose count,
And the only thing now was to rack its poor brains
By reckoning up the amount.
""Two added to one--if that could but be done,""
It said, ""with one's fingers and thumbs!""
Recollecting with tears how, in earlier years,
It had taken no pains with its sums.
""The thing can be done,"" said the Butcher, ""I think.
The thing must be done, I am sure.
The thing shall be done! Bring me paper and ink,
The best there is time to procure.""
The Beaver brought paper,portfolio, pens,
And ink in unfailing supplies:
While strange creepy creatures came out of their dens,
And watched them with wondering eyes.
So engrossed was the Butcher, he heeded them not,
As he wrote with a pen in each hand,
And explained all the while in a popular style
Which the Beaver could well understand.
""Taking Three as the subject to reason about--
A convenient number to state--
We add Seven, and Ten, and then multiply out
By One Thousand diminished by Eight.
""The result we proceed to divide, as you see,
By Nine Hundred and Ninety Two:
Then subtract Seventeen, and the answer must be
Exactly and perfectly true.
""The method employed I would gladly explain,
While I have it so clear in my head,
If I had but the time and you had but the brain--
But much yet remains to be said.
""In one moment I've seen what has hitherto been
Enveloped in absolute mystery,
And without extra charge I will give you at large
A Lesson in Natural History.""
In his genial way he proceeded to say
(Forgetting all laws of propriety,
And that giving instruction, without introduction,
Would have caused quite a thrill in Society),
""As to temper the Jubjub's a desperate bird,
Since it lives in perpetual passion:
Its taste in costume is entirely absurd--
It is ages ahead of the fashion:
""But it knows any friend it has met once before:
It never will look at a bride:
And in charity-meetings it stands at the door,
And collects--though it does not subscribe.
"" Its flavor when cooked is more exquisite far
Than mutton, or oysters, or eggs:
(Some think it keeps best in an ivory jar,
And some, in mahogany kegs)
""You boil it in sawdust: you salt it in glue:
You condense it with locusts and tape:
Still keeping one principal object in view--
To preserve its symmetrical shape.""
The Butcher would gladly have talked till next day,
But he felt that the lesson must end,
And he wept with delight in attempting to say
He considered the Beaver his friend.
While the Beaver confessed, with affectionate looks
More eloquent even than tears,
It had learned in ten minutes far more than all books
Would have taught it in seventy years.
They returned hand-in-hand, and the Bellman, unmanned
(For a moment) with noble emotion,
Said ""This amply repays all the wearisome days
We have spent on the billowy ocean!""
Such friends, as the Beaver and Butcher became,
Have seldom if ever been known;
In winter or summer, 'twas always the same--
You could never meet either alone.
And when quarrels arose--as one frequently finds
Quarrels will, spite of every endeavor--
The song of the Jubjub recurred to their minds,
And cemented their friendship for ever!"

492,Emotion,HuntingPoemsFoxHuntingPoembyRudyardKipling,"THE FOX MEDITATES
When Samson set my brush afire
To spoil the Timnites barley,
I made my point for Leicestershire
And left Philistia early.
Through Gath and Rankesborough Gorse I fled,
And took the Coplow Road, sir!
And was a Gentleman in Red
When all the Quorn wore woad, sir!
When Rome lay massed on Hadrian's Wall,
And nothing much was doing,
Her bored Centurions heard my call
O' nights when I went wooing.
They raised a pack-they ran it well
(For I was there to run 'em)
From Aesica to Carter Fell,
And down North Tyne to Hunnum.
When William, landed hot for blood,
And Harold's hosts were smitten,
I lay at earth in Battle Wood
While Domesday Book was written.
Whatever harm he did to man,
I owe him pure affection;
For in his righteous reign began
The first of Game Protection.
When Charles, my namesake, lost his mask,
And Oliver dropped his'n,
I found those Northern Squires a task,
To keep 'em out of prison.
In boots as big as milking-pails,
With holsters on the pommel,
They chevied me across the Dales
Instead of fighting Cromwell.
When thrifty Walpole took the helm,
And hedging came in fashion,
The March of Progress gave my realm
Enclosure and Plantation.
'Twas then, to soothe their discontent,
I showed each pounded Master,
However fast the Commons went,
I went a little faster!
When Pigg and Jorrocks held the stage,
And Steam had linked the Shires,
I broke the staid Victorian age
To posts, and rails, and wires.
Then fifty mile was none too far
To go by train to cover,
Till some dam' sutler pupped a car,
And decent sport was over!
When men grew shy of hunting stag,
For fear the Law might try 'em,
The Car put up an average bag
Of twenty dead per diem.
Then every road was made a rink
For Coroners to sit on;
And so began, in skid and stink,
The real blood-sport of Britain!"

That orange ball has begun to glow
It won't be very long now
It will be time for the show
The hounds are in the truck
Just waiting to use their noses
As soon as we set them free
There will be all kinds of noises
Now the hounds are on the hunt
Covering all of the woods lands
They have noses thousands more powerfull
Than that of any fellow man
One just struck a track
And now the race has begun
The hounds bark in harmony
Like a song that's never been sung
Now their voices start their changing
As they start locking on the tree
They have rounded up the raccoon
Now it's our turn to go and see
The coon is surely up the tree
We can see its eyes shine bright
As we are standing under the tree
Shining and looking at it with our light
Now it's time to leash the dogs
And load them back in the truck

I can feel that steady drum beat,
Following the ruby river
With fingertips like bloodhounds,
Tracking it to the source.
But continually the heart flees,
Running from this pain
That only ardor can inflict.
We all know it is only amour
We must armor ourselves for.
Love is a machete
Slashing on both sides -
As you fall into love,
And as you fall out -
All the time while under its spell
We are like sleepwalkers
Balancing on the single edge
That does not cut."

On the mountain dawns the day;

With hawk and horse and hunting-spear,
Hounds are in their couples yelling,
Hawks are whistling, horns are knelling,
Merrily, merrily mingle they
Waken, lords and ladies gay.
Waken, lords and ladies gay,
The mist has left the mountain gray;
Springlets in the dawn are steaming,
Diamonds on the brake are gleaming;
And foresters have busy been
To track the buck in thicket green;
Now we come to chant our lay,
Waken, lords and ladies gay.
Waken, lords and ladies gay,
To the greenwood haste away;
We can show you where he lies,
Fleet of foot and tall of size;
We can show the marks he made
When 'gainst the oak his antlers fray'd;
You shall see him brought to bay
Waken, lords and ladies gay.
Louder, louder chant the lay,
Waken, lords and ladies gay!
Tell them youth and mirth and glee
Run a course as well as we;
Time, stern huntsman! who can balk,
Staunch as hound and fleet as hawk:
Think of this, and rise with day,
Gentle lords and ladies gay!"

Tears of dejection,
She is an ordinary girl,
A dark complexion!
A few women are coming,
To see her,
They want a match,
For a promising youth,
She is excited,
Her heart is beating,
She is twenty nine!
She is attractive.
She is lean and smart,
She is educated,
A working woman,
A bank officer,
She is famous for her cooking,
She is famous for her sewing,
She is famous for her knitting,
Well behaved,
Nice manners,
Has a kind heart,
Ready to serve,
And helpful!
She had made up,
Her eyes like stars,
She has dressed her hairs,
Shining and silky,
She has selected,
The best dress she has.
At the scheduled time,
The promising youth,
With her mother,
And two younger sisters,
All having dark complexion,
And a bulky body,
And the belly of the youth,
A real fun!
Came to see her,
They saw her,
They talked her,
They asked questions,
About her job and her salary,
And while leaving,
The old woman said,
Although her complexion is dark,
Although we don't expect,
A handsome dowry,
Still, We select her.
After their departure,
The girl went in her room,
And started crying,
She could not say her mother,
They haven't selected me,
They selected my income!"

0,Emotion,IdentityPoemsIdentityASonnetPoembyGerardAddingtonDArcyIrvine,"Identity: A Sonnet
That I am I, I surely know full well ;
I know my littleness and little place,
And how I feebly run my life's great race ;
Yet if an angel came with power to tell
Me how to be another I, and dwell
In his environment and ampler space,
Myself, annihilate; I'd set my face,
And be myself, though prisoned in a cell.
God made me, me, in changeless entity,
And could I be another, where were I ?
'Tis not that others are not nobler far ;
My light a spark, the while they sun-like shine
But living here or in some distant star,
Their lives are theirs, and mine for ever mine."
1,Emotion,IdentityPoemsAnIdentityPoembySomeGirl,"I had one once -
an identity
having one meant
the world to me -
an identity
before it was
taken from me
i knew who i
was and who
i'd become
without it I
was no one -
lost identity
i no longer
understood
understood the
meaning of life
i need it back -
my identity

2,Emotion,IdentityPoemsIdentityPoembyauthorunknown,"I wonder if the trees can hear me
When I scream aloud,
Or if the dandelion screams,
When I pick him out.
There's no telling where life can take us;
One day I'm a blade of grass,
But today I am myself-
Nobody else.
Life chooses  for me to be me."

4,Emotion,IdentityPoemsMistakenIdentityPoembyDavidHarris,"There are many times I have been mistaken
for something I am not.
People mistake me as an ordained priest,
but in fact, I am not.
You could call me an actor
who just happens to live the part.
Admittingly I do most things
a real priest would in their lives do,
give comfort to the sick and dying
and other things do.
However please do not be mistaken
that is not acting, its just part of my personality,
something I have always done
even before I got the part.
Those who needed my words of comfort
always seemed to find me,
and I would never turn them away.
Don’t ask me why I am this way;
there is no answer I can give you.
I hate to see suffering
whether it be in friend or foe.
I made a promise to myself
a long, long time ago
that if I could make someone smile
each and every day,
then I would be smiling too.
There have been a very few times occasions
when that promise has been broken,
because sometimes I could not do it.
They were mainly when
great sadness caught up with me,
but most of the time you will find me
with a smile on my face
and mischievous twinkle in my eye.
That is because at heart
I am something of a clown
and a practical joker.
One thing I am not
and something I will never be
is what many people call me,
and that is an angel
as there are too many faults
that lie behind me.

5,Emotion,IdentityPoemsIdentityPoembyabhimanyukumars,"This is to the motherland,
Where I am born.
This is to the teacher,
Who taught me nothing.
This is to my lover,
Who turned away from me.
Many are there to address,
Very few to notice.
What have you taught me?
Why the hell you came in?
Why did I even open my eyes mother!
Hybridity, Modernization, Temporary.
Yes, You all have lost me,
Lost your identity in my life.
Dedicated to the ones who have lost their identity.

6,Emotion,IdentityPoemsAMomentaryMoleculeOfMuteIdentityPoembyAnantaMadhavan,"Two birds on the wing early morning,
Flying northward for a drink or a splash
Or simply to escape their quest for comfort;
Or no quest at all, but just a place to rest,
A refuge from always waiting for refuge.
I think that every life is a question
For which there is no single answer.
What if we think of every life
As an answer to an unspoken question?
It is a question of the unique singularity
Of what relates to that particular life.
I find felicity in momentary images.
In fine arts and music there may be
Some residues of birds soaring and gliding
On air currents that kindle sunlight at dawn.
A light green streak of wings across my view:
A little bird has flown away at dawn.
We cannot put metronomes to the waves of the sea.
Such art works happen in evanescence.
Enough to have become self-aware
As a momentary molecule of mute identity."
7,Emotion,IdentityPoemsMistakenIdentityPoembyDavidLewisPaget,"The mother lay in a stupor filled
With alcohol and drugs,
The twins lay wet in the carry-cot
And screamed at the top of their lungs,
The boyfriend of the moment sat
At a bar in a nearby town,
Drinking away the welfare cheque
And taking them further down.
Sally Pearce was a homely girl
As such, and easily led,
Many a teenage male had found
His way to her maiden bed,
They bought her favours with alcohol
And hooked her on cocaine,
They so befuddled her mind that she
Could not remember her name.
So Jack had her in the morning when
The sun was low in the sky,
While Derek had her lunch when she
Had snorted coke, and was high,
She carried the seeds of both of them
And both of them found a home,
Embedded deep in her ovaries
As she lay drugged out, alone.
So when she heard she was having twins
She didn't know who to blame,
But thought it must be the first of them
So gave the twins Jack's name,
She didn't know that their fathers were
As different as chalk and cheese,
For Jack passed on a criminal gene
While Derek passed S.T.D's.
The first one born was Timothy,
With a mop of jet black hair,
Then twenty minutes to follow on
Came Adam, so pale and fair,
They could have been Cain and Abel
If she'd only studied the book,
For Adam was such a happy child
While Tim had an evil look.
She hardly saw them growing up
They learned to fend for themselves,
They'd go and ransack the kitchen
Pulling the food right off the shelves,
The boyfriends came and the boyfriends went
In a long, continuous line,
They didn't know what a father was
Nor a mother, most of the time.
The only love that they ever knew
Was their love for the brother twin,
For they were the only constants as
The others came out and in,
While Adam took to his books and proved
A whiz at Math in his school,
Timothy fought a constant war
To tell the truth, he was cruel.
He punched the boys and tortured the girls
And dipped their plaits in the ink,
Protected Adam from bullies and fools
But never had cause to think,
Adam went on to Uni while
Timothy took to the street,
Dealing in drugs, and taking home
Enough for his mother to eat.
Adam had met a girl called Gaye
She liked that his eyes were brown,
He gave her his sophomore ring one day
Escorted her round the town,
She wanted to meet his brother, Tim
But Adam would not be drawn,
He said that his brother had gone away
‘Til he called one day, to the dorm.
Timothy's eyes had met with Gaye's
And they felt a shock of delight,
For opposites often attract, they say,
As day will follow on night,
For Gaye was ripe with an innocence
That will fall for an evil spell,
So Timothy started meeting her
In the quad, by the old stairwell.
They found her body at Easter-time
Down an old storm-water drain,
Raped and beaten, her throat was cut,
And they said, ‘He must be insane! '
Adam was taken down to the cells
And grilled for almost a day,
‘You were the girl's last boyfriend,
We'll be taking your D.N.A.'
The D.N.A. was almost a match
Enough for a guilty plea,
While Adam strongly denied the charge,
‘It certainly wasn't me! '
He didn't mention his brother's name,
But hoped he would see the day
When Timothy came to visit him,
But Timothy went away.
They came for him in the dawning light
And marched him into the shed,
His lips were trembling as he stood
And bit his lip ‘til it bled,
‘Any last words you'd like to say
Before you pay for your sin? '
The rope had tightened around his neck
When he almost whispered, ‘…'

8,Emotion,IdentityPoemsWhatIsIdentityPoembyMandyLee,"Identity is not a given;
it is a song; it is a quest.
It is a journey and its trials,
not just the outcome of a test.
It is the continual burning of a flame,
not the marks that a burning  flame leaves.
It is but the choices that you wrought,
not just the tapestry destiny weaves."
9,Emotion,IdentityPoemsIdentityIsATrapPoembyRmShanmugamChettiar,"Identity gives a meaning to life,
A sense of belonging in a society,
And helps one define oneself in oneself.
To lean this way is to go away from that.
Identity is a stake you cling to.
Identity is a mould you fix to.
Anything we think we are, becomes a trap,
A restriction to be something else.
You join a movement to share its force.
In the meanwhile, you lend it your force.
Subsequently you lose your independence
In judging and mortgage yourself to it.
Be in a set up not to be fanatic.
Being neither distantly isolated
Nor absolutely  identified
With anything is freedom to enjoy.

10,Emotion,IdentityPoemsIdentityPoembythumper786,"Identity is not what I promise others
Identity is what I do when I am alone
Identity is what I think of others
Knowing all the hatred they've shown
Identity is what I make out of my given chance
Identity is what I accept and what I deny
No one else has control over me
Life is about me, and what I identify
Identity is what every wound reminds me
Identity is what I learn and what I pass by
Identity is what I see in the mirror
After giving my best try
But this mirror shows a reflection
of a mind that wavers thin
along the line
that savours pain
my friends and fam keep saying to me
behind the surface
we know its you
its you we know
we know your through
we know your done man, your gone
But thats not what I believe
I just got lost on the way
I know I can
untie these hands
and find my way again
To my real identity
Full of entity
its just this mirror staring back at me
I keep telling it
Mirror, mirror
Surly you do lie.
We don’t see eye to eye.
Your image is surly haunting.
My self-esteem you’re taunting
Are you showing my insides?
Why cant you give me pride?
It really ain't fair
I cant help but stop and stare
Now you’re smashed in thousands
A thousand me’s surrounding
look at me
it's not my true identity
Your showing me that I have a covert identity,
i wonder if you'd ever see,
my thoughts, my deeds
are all that makes me
but something I may do
may not describe me.
My true identity
has fled me,
fled me to another
to my friends and family
my true identity
is all that makes me.
So lost deep inside
if its not for my soul
i would be lost again
my true identity
is hard to see.
My message is to
Accept who you are
recognize your own beauty
identity isn't a need,
your identity should be your own
a better person you will be known
this is me, this is my identity
my true identity is all full of beauty and entity"
11,Emotion,IdentityPoemsStolenIdentityPoembyKathrynGarner,"This is a stolen identity
Because I’m bent on forgetting me
All left is my eyes
And I think their gonna die
Don’t look in, you can see me
I’d rather wear this stolen identity
Exactly what they want to see
I’ve got the lock on the door
Don’t force yourself to love me anymore
You don’t need to
I’m now something new
But its not really me, it’s all for you
He put the stitches on the cut
When she’s perfect, then there’s love
She’s perfect in this mask
Hiding his shame at last
Because without identity goes the past
No, I can’t look up to your eyes
I know I’ve got something else in me
It’s breathing hard, it tries rise
Like the third of a trinity
No, I’ve got this at last
Now I’ve found the perfect mask
And I’ll shake these thoughts with this flask
Because with this failure goes a past
That he never wanted to see
A part that was forced to bleed
But with this identity goes stitches
Though it bleeds, though it itches
But I’m sewn up, strung out, all you’ll ever need
Though these stitches bleed"

In Twilight-land--in No-man's land--
Two hurrying Shapes met face to face,

""I know not,"" said the second Shape,
""I only died last night!"""

It's always been in front of me
But I guess I was to blind to see.
And I'm happy.
I never understood why they cry when they read the words.
I never understood why a rock meant such worth.
I never understood why they prepare for the worst.
Now look at me.
One chapter and I'm teary.
I stand five times but don't grow weary.
I guess it's because I found me,
My true identity."

Con sternation was caused when a name change was brought about in Feb.2002 and the well known and well worn sound of FINISTERRE was transformed into FITZROY. It was as if one had attacked a living person...a great British institution and there was uproar and pandemonium.
But FITZROY  won the day and the man who carried Darwin on the BEAGLE and invented the weather forecast was the new sound in town. He was a Christian creationist and never forgave himself for evolving Darwin and indeed committed suicide later on in life over the grief of this.)

I can't attract the virgin sitting on the stone
As she washes her dreams I ogle at the pink breasts
Passing silently within confines of my sandy shores;
I was not what I was
I am not what I am
The moon has lost faith upon me
In the henna scented nights
I invite the owl to dropp the remnants of a mouse
Hanging from its beak;
It breaks the mirror
The moon gets scared and melts like wax;
I was not what I was
I am not what I am
The dead leaves are left in the banks
The worms crept through their veins
Poodles are silent in the paw marks
Half reflecting the clouds in opaque lens
I vow to die in the muddy floor
As crabs move straight in a crazy dance
I was not what I was
I am not what I am
As I was hoisted into the void
The pallid sun gets its life
My body turns from blue to grey
The lightening acts as a treacherous knife
The fall is ominously great
The lap is full of thorn and ignorance is rife

Ah! coal again always coal
I conjure you coal tutelary genius of dreams and my
solitude let me let me speak again of the beautiful
swimmer who was afraid of coral
No longer tyrannize this seductive subject of my
dreams
The beautiful swimmer was reposing in a bed of lace
and birds
The clothes on a chair at the foot of the bed were
illuminated by gleams the last gleams of coal
The one that had come from the depths of the sky and
earth and sea was proud of its coral beak and great
wings of crape
All night long it had followed divergent funerals toward
suburban cemeteries
It had been to embassy balls marked white satin gowns with
its imprint a fern leaf
It had risen terribly before ships and the ships had not
returned
Now crouched in the chimney it was watching for the
waking of foam and singing of kettles
Its resounding step had disturbed the silence of nights
in streets with sonorous pavements
Sonorous coal coal master of dreams coal
Ah tell me where is that beautiful swimmer the swimmer
who was afraid of coral?
But the swimmer herself has gone back to sleep
And I remain face to face with the fire and shall remain
through the night interrogating the coal with wings of
darkness that persists in projecting on my monotonous
road the shadow of its smoke and the terrible
reflections of its embers
Sonorous coal coal pitiless coal"

On the day he walked through London Town,
When out of the corner of his eye he spotted
His true-love - with another guy!
Turning his head, he just walked away
He would think about this another day...
Like Scarlett O'Hara, he knew the score,
When chips were down it was love no more.

His own true-love, in her favourite chair.
She'd waited for hours. How wrong could he be?

Not from a privileged class
And my grandfather..was a farmer
Neither well-bred, nor well-born!

Made of branches and cane
Are you satisfied with my status?

To search for my identity.

I differentiated myself for a subtle known cause.
To be the best amongst all of them.
And to prevent them not to know of my identity loss
The good that I achieved
Doesn’t seem to be no more
Or probably it wasn’t good enough
For my conscience to be sure
I was probably the most competitive
In an effort to establish my superiority
I’m still to reach that ultimate position
To re-establish my lost identity.

The beauty you can see in yourself,
And the hostility.

Until then I will not blame anyone

The way you care or feel is part of you
Your inner soul we hope keeps you true
Perhaps you have a real gift
Or maybe others spirits you do lift
It’s the way you laugh and joke
Or the way you give others hope
Perhaps its that you fight so hard
Or that no one can ever beat u at cards
Or that you are a great cook
Identity is not just how you do look
Its how you act think what you find true
That’s the identity of being you"

40,Emotion,IdentityPoemsIdentityPoembyKumarDheeraj,"Truest is my identity
Truest I'm here.
I'll not shy, I'll not pretend
Coz now I don't have any fear.
Fear, That sucked me up
Was a dark black cloud to me ever
Once ruled me as a ruling king
Forced me to be his slaved queen forever.
He thought to possess me
And to leave me never.
Was darkest of all the darkness
Became a Rival lover.
His strength was really promising
Capturing me in my veins
But was actually unaware
Of my psychic powers and brains.
I came to my real I
And they all (fears) became the greatest lie
Me became the truest truth
Evil fears will surely die."

Who is ours and who is not?
For a moment, felt someone known

43,Emotion,IdentityPoemsASingleIdentityPoembyRAJNANDY,"Notwithstanding how you view the morn,
Or see the sunrise and the dawn,
Over the high mountain Alps,
Or over the vast blue sea, or desert sand,
The sky shall be and always retain,
Its one single identity!
Notwithstanding how you share your
heart,
Or break it up into many parts,
And  share its love with many or few,
Your heart shall be one and the same,
A single heart it shall remain!
No matter how you live this life,
Through your childhood, manhood  and
old  age,
And  live through all its different stage,
Your life shall  be  one, just the same!
Since only one life is your  due,
Live it well and then bid  adieu!
Let us then share our lives and our hearts,
As we share the sky with life on earth,
And with mankind let us maintain,
A single identity forever retain!"

the side you’ll never know,
the side I’m ashamed of
and the side I’ll never show
Deep in the night
I feel the icy need
For this life to end
And me to do the deed
But this fear holds me back
This fear of death and life
yes it sounds messed up
But it evens out with a knife
The knife that slices my skin
Marring my soul forever
You’ve just cracked the surface
Love will end this endeavor"

But like stone
No emotions

You hear no one
You listen to no person
You go aimlessly

You have no feelings
Only believe in stealing
And hurt sentiments
That is real picture at present
I shall close eyes
And try
Not to be same
For my identity to claim"
47,Emotion,IdentityPoemsIdentityOfAPersonPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"Identity of a person
Identity signifies complexity
Identity identifies with reality
Identity is the bearer of all vanity
How does a person identify with identity?
You define yourself based on what?
They say, they say
You’re kind or moral based on what?
Or
You’re a genius and shrewd based on what?
Or
You make the perfect lover, look for no other
They say, they say
You’re strong without a thought it may not last long
Or
You’ve skills since with a record you run up high bills
Or
You are shy but no one ever talks to you or says hi
Or
You never give up because right now you are on top
They say, they say
You are generous or gregarious when all you are is conscious
Or
You’re innovative yet not the originator of the idea conceived
What are the facts?
That makes your identity intact
When change on identity has the last impact?

What is that identity
And who is competent to
Issue identity card
In whose favor
And for what purpose
All the things we have to know
From here, from our
Day to day activities.
Let me say all the identity cards
Are bogus cards as they are
Not based on Truth
And Truth needs no identity card
Like the the sun and the moon
Like the air and the sky
Like the earth and the water,
We are here to see how the clouds
Are going away from the sky
We are to see the light
Only by its grace.
Here, the question is about identity.
Identify first who is who and
What is what if you are able, my dear."

Without an iota of shame-

More than stealing a name.
A written poem or story

Is like robbing him of self
Taking out his heart.
Putting on his person,
It's identity theft!

I hope you end up deaf.

50,Emotion,IdentityPoemsMistakenIdentityPoembySumeetMukherjee,"My dream as a child
Became a passion in my youth
To search for my identity
And search for a truth
I differentiated myself from every other mortal
I differentiated myself for a subtle known cause
To be the best amongst all of them
And to prevent my identity loss
The great that I achieved
Doesn’t seem to be any more
Or probably it wasn’t great enough
For my conscience to be sure
I was probably the most competitive
In an effort to establish my superiority
I’m still to reach that ultimate position
To re-establish the mistaken identity
I would stand nowhere
If they all fall in my shoes
My identity is mistaken for nothing
Don’t know for the fault of whose."

52,Emotion,IdentityPoemsQuestionableIdentityPoembyDeodathDebideen,"What, not who are you, is the question
On your identity
Though you are an invisible being
The system says you're the body
Protoplasm's just biological cells
Chemically bonded together
Sex by Mother and Father
God's recipe they did foster
Dead cells you are not
Neither are you living cells
The invisible soul in the head
That body-robot propels
Soul in a body alone
Is a seeker's obsession
Such luck is not possible
Satan comes in as a possession
Physical body that's inert
Until enlivened by a soul
Corrupted by evil in the flesh
COUP is its goal
The body is one fraction
Empowered by good and evil
Soul must fight with all its might
To retrieve its body from the devil
The inner sanctum of the skull
Is where the Soul is located
The remaining flesh is satan's home
Until the dark side is defeated
So WHAT is your identity
Which 'I' do you proclaim to be
Sometimes soul, mostly dark side
Fluctuating ownership of the protoplasmic body
So civilization has us fooled
By denoting I, YOU, and WE
Such denotation varies upon
WHAT controls the body
Everyone is not the same each minute
Do not expect anything different
Soul or dark side will 'behave'
As per which one is ascendant
We were born like this, my friends
In the battlefield of the body
If the Soul does not rise up
Suppressed it lives, unfree
Names are just another trick
To make you feel secure
Often it is the protoplasm they mean
And evidenced by a picture
Go beyond names and forms
To find the essence of the soul
Now you know why it must be done
Soul existence to unfold"

Women always need attention
If all want its retention
In life and elsewhere
One must always stand firmly and dare
No doubt, they have suffered most
At heavy cost
Cruelty in behavior
And almost compromise with honor
She has stood ground well
For the whole of world to tell
'Look we are no mean creature'
But you’re sure future
Generations have been bought
But we are always caught
Between good and devil
We shall survive still
We shall rise from dust
As our main asset is trust
We hold it most
As time is still not lost
Give them strength
As they serve till death
With power and dignity
And hold personal identity"

I hope and seek in vain

I long in my self-sympathy
to reach some other soul,
with satisfying empathy
to make my being whole.
In truth I long not all for thee

'Where is the one who should be me?
My soul, my self,  my 'I'?"

And identity issues.
While those who have put a stamp on their individuality,
Are said to believe themselves better than the others...
With attempts they make to prove they seek to experience,
More than just an average existence by doing things to improve...
Their outlooks with an adventuring done to explore their lives,
Away from routine complaints and gossiping about others!"

Sometime Jesus appeared to rectify them.

Do their souls embody inside me?
Or my own soul is dead alive then
I gaze at my own plain mirror
I can't find reflection of mine.
I'm searching myself inside me
But not capable to find out yet.
Shall I manage for meditation
Or need to seek for revolution.

To establish  myself as an unique me.

Adam and Eve are my grandparents
We all are their children;
This land is my terminal
I will leave it after certain time
But on right path here I have to earn all
I need meet their team,
This is the only way to be successful
After the very resurrection;
Otherwise, I'll fail
And will be thrown to destruction."

I thought it was you
Or I would surely never dared

Who made you guardian of my days,
Master of each step?
The spirit will retaliates,
Becoming suppressed.
I thought it was you,
Wearing an angelical smile
And with sparkling eyes
Bewitching me with its magic.
As time slowly passed.
The truth was clearly revealed
When I saw the fake lover
Hiding behind the mask.
I thought it was you,
The one permanently fixed
In my heart and mind
And also in my dreams.
Disappointed now I am
But with faith and hope
I will eventually survive
And see a brighter light.
One sunny day
While the butterflies dance
And the birds happily sing,
I shall find you my angel,

It is accepted and denied by none
Still we involve and cross
Create the hurdles across
Forget the humanity
So much thrust for hostility
Shall we pray for fine out come?
Under one shed all are welcome
Blood is always thick and red
W are made to believe and fed
All untruths about worldly affairs
Nothing stands for good as fair
Shall we not abide by Divine dictates?
Does it not stand for anything good to indicate?
We still keep our selves in blind condition
Don’t miss any chance for providing ignition
Nothing prevents us from doing the good
It must be seen and clearly understood
We may be left behind in isolation
If we don’t keep up in tune or with relation
It moves on as per schedule
There is no prepared module
It may go on endlessly
We need not bother and go after it needlessly
It is reprieve from Him and very temporary
We must adhere to certain things and it is necessary
The life is precious and must be taken care of
It may not help you any time even if you cry wolf
Love to spend it in descent way and manner
At the end you will definitely be the gainer
It is natural law that every action has got reaction
There will be suitable reward for good action
Nothing goes unnoticed or unheeded
His blessings are always needed
We may not be able to move a single inch
Try for the good deal and clinch"

U struggle to keep yourself afloat.
When who you are, you seem not to know.
The journey to find one's self seem unsure.
The inner self broken and bruised.
Not to fear, theirs more in me.
Despite, the events that try hard to be.
My Identity is God's gift to me.
Everyone's unique, with much diversity.
So with God's grace put upon me.
Identity is also an inner beauty

Our individuality is just one layer, a small brick
In a multilayered cosmic structure.
We are part of a bigger world,
And wish to be part of that larger identity.
To be a mother-father, brother-sister,
Son or  daughter or a friend and relative
Is part of accepting that greater identity.
A social activity related to the service of others
Is rewarded by a sense of elation and stimulation.
In an environment where wider consciousness
Of a larger community is overlooked
Sense of oneness is diminished.
A segregated individual starts to
Suffer from malice of loneliness
Holding an insecure place
In a large body of universal existence."

83,Emotion,IdentityPoemsMyFracturedIdentityPoembyValsaGeorge,"After years of aimless wanderings
Leaving behind the cities of midnight revels
And the fevered journey in metro rails,
I am back at the land of my people.
My land, I had carried
Wherever I went,
Under which ever roof I slept
As a jewel in a casket
And ensured it rested safe
Ever under my pillow
Moving with aliens
Unable to merge with their cultural mores
I saw my land glimmer in darkness
Like dew drop on a moon blanched leaf
When I sweated in the blistering sands
That patch of green landscape, like an oasis
Wafted me in a cool embrace
Then dreams poured in like star light
And I wandered in the meadows of my youthful love
My heart struggling to forget old longings
And memories lashing upon me like tidal waves
Pursued by an inalienable shadow
Suddenly being born in flesh and blood
I hastened to the streets of my youth
With hopes galore and plans vivid
But alas! There is none to recognize me
Oh! I am a stranger here
An unwelcome stranger among total strangers
Now I wonder which really is my land
The one left behind or the one just landed in
Oscillating between these two worlds
My fractured identity looms large
With worms of memories wriggling in my flesh
And a myth dying in my brain"

85,Emotion,IdentityPoemsPersonalIdentityAsPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"Personal identity
Women always need attention
If all want its retention
In life and elsewhere
One must always stand firmly and dare
No doubt, they have suffered most
At heavy cost
Cruelty in behavior
And almost compromise with honor
She has stood ground well
For the whole of world to tell
'Look we are no mean creature'
But you’re sure future
Generations have been bought
But we are always caught
Between good and devil
We shall survive still
We shall rise from dust
As our main asset is trust
We hold it most
As time is still not lost
Give them strength
As they serve till death
With power and dignity
And hold personal identity"

And it is beyond any estimation."

all try to give themselves a name
pick on the boy who is all alone
just because his identity is his own
what has this world come to?
all this wrong that people do
just for the image they want to show
down the evil path they seem to go
The next person you go to hurt
or try to make feel like dirt
instead of trying to look cool
feel for the guy you make look a fool

Your identity should be your own
A better person you will be known."

And carrier
With beautiful message as known lover
Love transmits disease

To go in one direction

With simple identity
And strong affinity"

Trying to please all others' wants
Put your wisdom first and the rest is sure to come"

A poem by: Abdel latif Moubarak … Egypt
Translate by: Fawzy Al-Shalabi
A Wonder without an Identity
And the secret remains in your eyes a pearl
Expressing…everything which wasn't
So granted the heart a skater
And when the nights are narrowed us to live
Besieging us bundles of love sometimes
Trait of a thing… we aware …and touch
Lives in vibrations of the lightening
A wonder without an identity
In the silence was the nectar
And sneakily blaspheming in the pulse was the fire
Holding light of the hope
Playing surviving melody
Explosion crown of the polluted sadness
In blood…with the tears
And still a pleasure there in your eyes
A fertile nursery…the salvage
To the failures of a catastrophe touch
Sensing you in my blood
Crevices of freshened emotions
To land of such a plant
From the pain of the crowd
An existence
Decanting the sense state
From dispersion of the memory"

my name was chosen
by my parents
before I came
and after birth
a note was bound
at my toe what a shame
My parents
called my name
and my heart beats
but I was a human
without an ID-card
also when I fall asleep
My identity
is not my passport
not my name
not my land
not what I write
with my free hands
My identity
is not my color
not my size
not my language
or my character
even not my price
My identity
is not my dental filling
my eye color
or my hair
not my fingerprint
my job or my salary
My identity
is different
from me
because it is
given
to separate me
Separates me
from girls and boys
even from twins
and natural
toys
Separates me
from religions
politics and class
is written
in my document of birth
and my testament at last
This identity
is given by state
to control
where I am
even to find me
paying no toll
But my own
identity is my life
are my parents
is my wife
are my children
and my friends
my identity
IS
the promised land
is the playground of my soul.

A loss of identity lately

I've been feeling slightly odd lately
And I wish that I could say
That I'll be over it quite quickly
But I think I've lost my way...
My bearings are all boggled
And I've gotten all mixed up
Am I really upside down...
Or is it actually downside up? ?

But surely you can see
If you give me back my maple leaf
I'll be as happy as can be! !

you said auntie maybe next time you'll try cousin
what i know to be a fact
is that love is a act
i have no time for a simple man

i need someone i can trust
being straightforward is a must
i need someone that's real
that actually cares about how i feel

good luck with the other

say they carry the light, also

Funny how the rich are exempt

how the nations with the most to give
play the best game of politics
supplying the weaponry that
eventually kills
even their own children.
Funny isn’t it how the world works
with its upside down righteousness
and its lawful in-justice, while

117,Emotion,FunnyPoemsTheFunnyLittleFellowPoembyJamesWhitcombRiley,"'Twas a Funny Little Fellow
Of the very purest type,
For he had a heart as mellow
As an apple over ripe;
And the brightest little twinkle
When a funny thing occurred,
And the lightest little tinkle
Of a laugh you ever heard!
His smile was like the glitter
Of the sun in tropic lands,
And his talk a sweeter twitter
Than the swallow understands;
Hear him sing--and tell a story--
Snap a joke--ignite a pun,--
'Twas a capture--rapture--glory,
An explosion--all in one!
Though he hadn't any money--
That condiment which tends
To make a fellow 'honey'
For the palate of his friends;--
Sweet simples he compounded--
Sovereign antidotes for sin
Or taint,--a faith unbounded
That his friends were genuine.
He wasn't honored, maybe--
For his songs of praise were slim,--
Yet I never knew a baby
That wouldn't crow for him;
I never knew a mother
But urged a kindly claim
Upon him as a brother,
At the mention of his name.
The sick have ceased their sighing,
And have even found the grace
Of a smile when they were dying
As they looked upon his face;
And I've seen his eyes of laughter
Melt in tears that only ran
As though, swift-dancing after,
Came the Funny Little Man.
He laughed away the sorrow
And he laughed away the gloom
We are all so prone to borrow
From the darkness of the tomb;
And he laughed across the ocean
Of a happy life, and passed,
With a laugh of glad emotion,
Into Paradise at last.
And I think the Angels knew him,
And had gathered to await
His coming, and run to him
Through the widely opened Gate,
With their faces gleaming sunny
For his laughter-loving sake,
And thinking, 'What a funny
Little Angel he will make!'"

Although you pray, mostly you play
To teach, to reach, to fetch one another
Even when your love groove you delay.
Together you sit, you eat, you study
You talk to them and you poke fun
At your mom who's your bosom buddy
And dear pop likes your witty pun.
Sometimes family irritates you stacks
Your fashion, your tuition they select
To pass on wisdom with love packs
When wrong choice you're about to elect.
Whatever the mood is in your cosy family
They mean well in all they choose to do;
Celebrating you or reading you riot homily
They love you. They do care, your home crew."

Cleopatra, the Egyptian Queen
Catherine hauntingly seeking Heathcliffe
Holly Go-Lightly crumbling quietly
Or Thelma and Louise....
Would you always find your heart
In this movie with a classic start
Would the girl get her man,
Would the goodies always win
Or would poignancy hit on the chin?
Would the script be a mirror?
Would you invite your friends for dinner
To see your life on the screen
Creating its own scenes, sets and dreams
Or would you keep it for a private viewing?

From Here to Eternity, wrestling in the sea
Love is a foundation for these films
Love will take the Oscar every time
Oh what money there is to be made
From love and shattered hopes and dreams
Directors cruelly playing to our hearts
We identify with everyone it seems...
But real life is not a contrived play
The music doesn't intervene magically
To create that perfect kiss, you never
Look like Audrey, or Elizabeth, or Marilyn
First thing in the morning....
The roses don't bloom spontaneously in time
The doorbell doesn't chime when you need it
Bouquets don't wait on your desk
His arms don't circle your waist whilst
You prepare dinner and wash dirty nappies
The diamond doesn't hide in your oyster
The stars don't collide with the moon
Fireworks don't fill the sky with colour
A symphony doesn't play in the background
Why do they deceive us so...
These 90 minute love affairs with life?
We lose ourselves in their wonderment
Close our eyes and silently scream
'Why doesn't that happen to me'.
Why can't I feel like a Pretty Woman
Where is my Knight in Shining Armour
Cruel things. Messing with our dreams
Making us discontent. Mm, what part will I play
Who will I be today? Which strong woman
Which one that gets their cake and eats it?
Which lady in rapturous love shall I be?
Lizzie waiting for her D'Arcy
Sandy in black leather for Danny
Match-maker Emma finding Mr Knightley
Juliet bereft over Romeo, but wait!
The looking glass tells me, it's just me"
124,Emotion,FunnyPoemsFunnyThingsTearsPoembyNancyHandabile,"The other day
I woke up feeling low
I tried not to think about you
to stop the inevitable tears that threatened to fall.
Funny things tears, they linger yet do not fall.
That night I got angry
as I walked fron the bus stop to my home
My mood slowly dissipated into sadness
I felt the bloody tears linger
am guessing they showed because some ladies looked at me
gossiped and actually stood to stare
Funny thing tears are, they know no shame.
Yesterday I drunk myself into a stupor
because I couldnt bear the thoughts
the happy memories, the questions.
I smoked because I wanted to burn away my pain
my loneliness, my intense craving to end it all
Funny things tears, they come when you least expect them
Last night I hated you
Hated my intense stupid love for you
Hated that my life was blank without you
I went running, jogging to absolve the pain
to numb myself, but pain is stubborn
I ran for miles but still felt that swift flash.
Funny things tears, they burn.
Today I woke up
ignoring my phone I tried to resist it
to resist the urge to call you,
But I did,
Lunch, drinks, kisses more promises
apologies more excuses
smiling, laughing, forgetting
Funny thing love it forgets the tears easily.
Tonight I sleep soundly
But Tommorow I work and the cycle begins.
Funny things tears sometimes they cleanse you."
125,Emotion,FunnyPoemsFunnyThingsThatHappenPoembymargarethaig,"Funny things that happen quite often to me,
Like going shopping for slippers, and come home without;
Or go out in a tshirt, but find it's back to front I see,
Am I going crazy,  what's happening should I shout?
Funny things that happen when you go to ring on the phone,
Then sure it's the right number, but a man says I've been here a year;
So you end up finding the man is your neighbor in his home,
So you gasp for an excuse, to get off the line, realizing he's so near.
Funny things that's happened to my dad one day,
He couldn't find his glasses, that were on his nose;
Where did you two put them now, is what he did say,
Even when we tried to show him, he was still full of woes.
Funny things had happened to me a while ago,
When I was engaged, a doctor thought I was a wife;
He had not read the history, if he had it would show,
But we just laughed, another funny story to my life."

131,Emotion,FunnyPoemsAFunnyHumanBeingPoembyMargaretAliceSecond,"Taking my little concerns and miniature
plans too seriously instead of laughing
at myself, telling all with shiny eyes of
my new ideals, taking new medication
enabling me to eat less and sitting still
for longer periods
The sitting still is happening, but without
a large dose of interest, is quite useless,
mind growing bored tries to veer off, yet
discipline keeps me at my desk without
accomplishment, boredom grows as I
fail to find islands
Of glorious escapism to give my feelings
a break from cold emptiness, floundering
I cast about, the world shrinking to fit into
my aching head changing me into a use-
less robot without interest, passion or
ideal - immobile
Without feeling and emotion - without
conscience to power movement of my
head and eyes, reading words without
understanding anything, unable to set
priorities - I have become a useless
robot - at least
I used to be a funny human being"

133,Emotion,FunnyPoemsOnlyFunnyPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"It is not only funny
But very astonishing and clumsy
We all know about the holiness of boobs
Holy mention too can be found in books
Women are much more praiseworthy
Some may wear the ugliness gifted from almighty
The deformity and unnatural growth is not in our hands
The body as such will be submerged and  melted at the end
All nourishment and food is catered from that part
Our life gets shape and growth from the very start
Let us adore and praise the ladies for commendable job
We should not denigrate their honor and rob
It may be shown as world record
Many may take it as mere reference for looking forward
Any good looking natural piece deserves to be praised
But wrong way of projection should also be outrightly condemned
It must be taken as deformity in body
It is not done for records by somebody
It is really annoying for its wrong way of presentation
Otherwise it is not even worth for its mention
The opinion and perception may vary
The impression and meaning may also differently carry
Yet the basic concept of giving honor to ladies need not be compromised
Ladies deserve good comments and treatment as consciously promised"

tell me can you smell the smell?
bats feet rubarub, salt and gum

This time i know I'll win
when he drinks my spell for him
add a little eye of rat, sicky glue
stuff from underneath my shoe!
frogs legs, ant wings
bogies too, all these things i cast on you
Stir it stir it, dancing round
boiling caldron on the ground
make it bubble, rubble spit
add a fart that'll do the trick
will he drink it?
hold his nose
please dont make me use the hose!
my bubbling coldron on the ground
dancing bare feet make no sound
my spell will work
this drink he takes
A carton from a wimpy shake
fill right up with spell of mine.
Mouse feet, chicken skin bacon ryn.
swallow it all, you will be mine.
wish this spell I did not make
Wish his heart was mine to take."

In amongst that crazy parody
Will Someone please tell me, I’ll give you money
What makes laughter, so darn funny!
Why, when you laugh do people laugh too?
Laugh not at things you say or things you do
Its crazy how when nothing’s funny
People laugh and clutch their to tummy

Never drool at bawdy damsels,

Turn you topsy and do pell-mell.
Darn, twisted foot that had me bent.
Showed my behind, a strategic rent.
Blithely swaying, her hand she lent.
In a hoarse report my airs were vent.
Poof! She mocked'n touched her lips.
Shifted weight to jiggle her hips.
Looked I up in an awkward gaze.
Allowed my self a feigned daze.
Hush I gawked at the straining zips.
Torso taut and wow! Jutting tips.
Saw me feast and tossed her head.
Woosh! There went, a tangle of red.
Silence fell as everyone looked.
Oh me gosh, now she's booked.
Mere stubble, on a balding crop.
Without her wig, what a flop!
Devious eyed, I eased my ‘self'
So did, all the gnomes and elf!
By this time, the crowd was near.
Shifty eyes now showed her fear.
Amid loud hoots and raunchy jeers.
Leather boots and bubbling beers.
Woe be gone and half in tears.
Stomped her feet and showed her rear.

140,Emotion,FunnyPoemsFunnyFatCatPoembyRitaElKhoury,"Once, there was a white cat
Who was really, really fat
So fat
She looked like a bat
Who has eaten a huge rat.
The cat was walking in the street
Following a beat, with her feet
Tic, tac, tic, tac
Tictactictactictac
Looking for anything to eat
Milk, fish, tuna, meat...
But what a pity
The street was empty
So empty
Not even a birdie
To make her get nasty.
The cat kept walking in the street
Following a beat, with her feet
Tic, tac, tic, tac
Tic, tac, tic, tac
Looking for somewhere to sleep
Bed'n'sheets? Get real! Just a seat...
But she didn't find any, what a shame
Because she was really lame
So lame
She had forgotten her own name
And from where she originally came.
So she kept walking in the street
Feeling the heat, and pain in her feet
Tic, tac, tic, tac
Tic,              tac
Looking for someone to blame
Same situation, same game...
Then, the white cat
Saw a tiny red hat
One hat
She ran, jumped and sat
In it, what a lucky cat!
But since she was really fat
She got stuck in the hat
So stuck
She looked like a rat
In a cheese trap.
A dog came walking in the street
Following a beat, with his feet
Tic, tac, tictac
Tic, tac, tictac
He saw something red
So he stopped near the cat's head:
'Haha! Cat, you pay the fees
For acting so bad with your peers! '
'Help, please'
'Call me bad boy, I love to tease
I'm getting outta here, say cheers! '
Then a bird came flying in the street
With his wings, following a beat
Tictactictactictac
Tictactictactictac< br>He saw something red
So he stopped above the cat's head:
'Oh, poor white cat
Are you trapped in this hat? '
'Damn I am! '
'Let me help you, sad little cat
Here, you're out, care for a chat? '
Rumors I heard
Say the cat ate the bird."

Where pain is pleasure and it is our pleasure to be of service

But my brain feels maimed with no ambition of fame
Just money and its funny all I want is that and my honey
Coz the rest are all dummies and I can’t get chummy
With new people who are feeble, fake, and evil
And old friends who crossed me are no longer equals
So i'm use to standing alone prone to breaking thrones
A war zone is my home and a battling I shall go
No love for my peers not after all these years
I won’t shed a tear to hear u all lost what is dear
Coz u haven’t got a clue on what it means to be true
All u do is front, your lost in an image that isn’t you
Like your all a heard of sheep, your all the same no one is unique
U will never reach the peak with all that rubbish you speak
A petty lil criminal running his mouth like he hard is so pitiful
Taking advice from a prisoner? U idiot that’s why u minimal
Wise up learn from the quiet ones before your freedom is critical"

Turn the other cheek

So, he called you a liar,
he says it's true,
no matter what you say
or what you do.
'Tis soul-killing
to suffer so,
to be thought as less

Well, time goes on
and another day comes;
feel the soft air, the sweet warm sun
and hold fast to this truth:
that you aren't over; life is far from done.

And shouting something kind
Instead I want to lash out
And jump and scream and curse

Only toothache could be worse.

Please do your best to serve
A clumsy man who's sat in pain

Knowing in your heart Im not outdoors
Because you love me too and I am sure

They think, our weakened stage has come,
And treat us worse than ev’n before!
When flag of truce, in hand we hold,
They stiffen conditions on us,
As though we can’t fight anymore!
When bow we as mark of respect,
They look down upon us askance,
As though we are worthless on earth!
The world today is suspicious;
The human lives are less precious;
There’s dearth of people more pious!
Man wants to do whatev’r he likes;
Money decides the things he does;
The love in families seems gone.
One wants to make a quicker buck;
One takes more risks and tries his luck;
One feels things can be got by pluck.
Oh, what a funny world, it seems!
The human face appears well-masked;
The heart of man is ne’er contrite!

157,Emotion,FunnyPoemsTheAgeBeforeTheComputerReallyFunnyPoembyDevangGandhi,"A server was a man with drinks
A Notebook was where you write
A click was done with fingers
And a reboot means you had a fight
Cyberspace was where the spaceships went
A screen saver was a cinema's bodyguard
Traffic only happened in cars
And Spam always had a lot of lard
Java was a type of bean
Hacking was what an axe-man's job,
A platform was where you sang
And a volley was a type of lob
Scan was to read really fast
A Moniter was a teacher
A shortcut was a dangerous way
And Shout-Outs done by preachers
Meg was the name of my girlfriend,
And gig was a job for the nights.
Now they all mean different things,
And that really mega bytes.
An application was for employment.
A program was a TV show.
A cursor used profanity.
A keyboard was a piano.
Memory was something that you lost with age.
A CD was a bank account.
And if you had a 3 inch floppy,
You hoped nobody would ever find out.
Compress was something you did to the garbage,
Not something you did to a file,
And if you unzipped anything in public
You'd be in jail for a while.
Log on was adding wood to the fire.
Hard drive was a long trip on the road.
A mouse pad was where a mouse lived,
And a backup happened to your commode.
Cut you did with a pocket knife.
Paste you did with glue.
A web was a spider's home,
And a virus was the flu.
I guess I'll stick to my pen and paper,
And the memory in my head.
I hear nobody's been killed in a computer crash,
But when it happens they wish they were dead!"

Dissect my quivering relapses

Really it is funny
Sun may not have remained sunny
It might have been witnessed by you and not by many
It might have come out from west
You might have gone for its test
Your may be searching for the rest
You prove to be dreamer and try for best
We see so many irrelevant things
It certainly to do something
The chain of thoughts goes on continuously
It is useless thinking if we admit honestly
We can’t base our plan on dreamy side
The reality and fact may remain open very wide
It may have pleasant side in the isolation
It has nothing to do with facts or relation
Still it is nice resort
We have so many comforts
Things move on as per our wish
The end has got very nice finish
Why it makes you so much happy?
You find beautiful girls to marry?
The sun doesn’t get set at all
It is always pleasant and happy call
Reveal it not for even for amusement
You may invite adverse comments
For you it may be fine moment
Enjoy it to self and make good movement"

isn't it funny,
how much you don't mean to me?
isn't it funny,
how much i care?
it really isn't funny,
when you're not there.
isn't it funny,
how we used to be?
isn't it interesting,
what you meant to me?
isn't it strange,
how we fell apart?
isn't it great,
we both miss our hearts?
one last thing,
before i throw this ring,
wasn't it funny...
to see what i'd do?
isn't it laughable,
how i still love you?"
164,Emotion,FunnyPoemsFunnyLifePoembyJOEPOEWHIT,"Were born, work hard at school, then work
hard for a family. Everything is right or

one wonder, about a pulsing heart beat

But when we were together you were never there
Isn’t it funny how to make me jealous you’re with her
But when you see me with him, everything starts to blur
Isn’t it funny how you want me to miss you
But when we were together, other girls you’d pursue

When im across the street in his arms wrapped up tight

While im in the sky, completely carefree

where have we been all these times

we have been writing poems

thinking that we are joking

169,Emotion,FunnyPoemsFunnyValentinePoembyClaudiaEmerson,"She had been a late and only child to parents
already old and set; none of us had ever
wanted to go inside that hushed house
and play with her, her room too neat, doll-crowded.
We did encourage her later, though, to enter
the high school talent contest—after we’d heard
her singing My Funny Valentine in a stall
in the girls’ bathroom, reckoning the boys
would laugh, perhaps find us even prettier
in comparison. Still, we would not have predicted
those wisteria-scaled walls, the one room
we could see from the street with its windows
open year round so that greening vines entered
and birds flew in and out—bad luck, we thought,
bad luck. By then we were members of the ladies’
garden club, the condition of her house
and what had been its garden a monthly
refreshment of disappointment, the most
delectable complaint her parents’ last
Coup de Ville sinking in tangled orchard grass
and filled to the roof—plush front seat and rear—
with paperbacks, fat, redundant romances
she had not quite thrown away—laughable,
we laughed, unphotographable—with wild restraint."
170,Emotion,FunnyPoemsTearsComeInFunnyPlacesPoembyLindaWinchell,"Tears come in funny places
when you least expect them too.
All of a sudden the eyes well up
crying out, with sounding vocals of ones, boo-hoo's!
You'll find them sometime appearing
while bidding a loved one, 'ado.'
Some are shed in a moments sadness
they are just that emotions, emotional fuse.
One might try to restrain their tears
from flowing down ones cheeks.
But you will never be able to stop their flow
it might cause you to spring a leak!
Joy, sadness, fear and anger
and from ones laughter, sometimes too!
Tears come in funny places
they can and will happen one day to you!"

Chemistry's betther than all the rest
Cause Mrs Rowen treats us the best.
Let's lay her in the ground and put her to rest.
We buried her deep and dark
She was left buck naked in the park.
We buried her chemistry book with her, so never again could she say she was right.
We had left her in the pitch black of the night.
We shall hear her voice 'girls are you following the book'
'yes miss' we reply and give her an evil look.
If you double the pressure, the volume will half.
We stuck the cross int he dirt and had a good laugh.
P1/T1=P2/T2 how is this going to help me decide what occupation to do?
We dug her up just for one last look.
But we found her reading theat bloody chemistry book.
Her mouth was open,
Her mouth was in a wiry grin
We could tell by her breath that she'd been drinking gin.
We stole her book and closed the coffin lid.
We buried her deeper, oh yes we did.
Our cross still stands.
Your'e a champ if you know Boyles law.
It will give you a top grade in the HSC for sure.
She once was an OK teacher
But now shes nothing but a chemistry preacher.
Dreams of her smiling down upon us asking 'where are you up to? '
I know whats going through her mind
What is the next chemical she adds to her deadly brew."

175,Emotion,FunnyPoemsInGodWeTrustOnMoneyThatsFunnyPoembyLukeEaster,"Many people are involved in a so-called monetary unjust,
With a hoop and a holler, turning a minor into a major fuss,
So, the newest one dollar coin is missing, “In God We Trust, ”
They’re calling the absent phrase a religious and political bust.
Hey, an email and the sender is extremely upset about the lack,
No, “In God We Trust” to the post office she wants to give it back,
A lot of families are hard hit as news programs document the lack,
But when cameras get close we see cigarettes and plenty of Jack.
The respect and use of any countries money has never changed,
Shekel, Denari, Peso, Yen, even solid gold, what’s in a name?
May in church circles will not even bother to pay their 10% tithes,
On that note, does it really matter and if so please elaborate why?
It’s not how much you have but what is done with it that counts,
The old woman put in two copper mites yet it was a greater amount,
Than those who gave plenty more out of their abundant wealth,
And no matter how much money you have it still can’t buy health.
“Silver & gold have I not but in the name of Jesus stand up & walk, ”
Oh yeah, “In God We Trust” was not on currency but in his talk,
Remember the phrase that, “a fool and money his soon will part, ”
Any amount is useless unless it’s written upon the spender’s heart.
Peter fetched a shekel from the mouth of a fish for taxes to pay,
What phrase and whose picture was on money back in the day?
The very best way to deal is by none other than barter and trade,
It is the one and only way to get out the exact amount you paid.
Undercover hit men are hired to kill a spouse yet they wind up in jail,
Rapists and drunks are released on insignificant amounts of bail,
Committing their crimes again, any one have a similar story to tell?
How many people carry money but still lie, cheat and raise hell?
And here’s the strangest situation, I just have to tell you this one,
A minister wanted to use “In God We Trust” money to buy a gun,
Not for the purpose of home protection they already had a target,
Funny! Murder on the mind from a perched position in the pulpit.
Okay! This helps to explain why there is a certain type of attrition,
Bullet manufacturers work 24/7, there’s a shortage of ammunition,
Not enough “In God We Trust” for lunch programs or Head Start,
However, way more than enough to brutally rip each other apart.
Yes, many people see this inscription as being a fresh new start,
“They honor Me with their lips but despise Me with their heart, ”
If “In God We Trust” on money was all that needed to be done,
Then God would never have needed to sacrifice His only Son.
'In God We Trust' was actually passed Into law only as a motto,
Good to know because this makes it even more shallow & hollow,
Teddy Roosevelt said sacrilegious, Supreme Court Would not relent,
So it's, 'lost through rote repetition any significant religious content.'
A very slick imposter hustler slides into ACORN seeking money,
With a hidden camera and his equally fake hooker looking honey,
Just to be sure there was no misunderstanding or optical illusion,
Staff told how to hide “In God We Trust” made from prostitution.
Assuredly, just as sure as Thursday follows Wednesday & without fail,
Before helping another in serious need some woman will do her nails,
And, certainly a priority will arise however if it is not one of their own,
Most people will first tip the driver who brings fried rice to their home.
As many are screaming for assistance their sounds fall on deaf ears,
Closest family and friends are more apt to buy fried chicken and beer,
Without a doubt everyone knows someone who’s in severe dire need,
Just make sure it’s for essentials, not cocaine, heroin, wine or weed.
By the way, it was all just an error on some, a simple mistake,
However, those coins are selling for $50 so they can’t be fake,
Dig this, without the inscription they’re worth a whole lot more,
And so the fact that they have more value might make Him sore.
Today’s currency is used for less good and way too much harm,
Drugs, sex, the black market, fraudulent claims and illegal arms,
The new dollar coin in missing, “In God We Trust” that is so funny,
Think God wants His name on anybody's uncircumcised money?"

The son replies he is scared because he dreamt that his aunt had died. Santa assures the son that Auntie is fine and sends him to bed.
The next day, Auntie dies. One week later, Santa again goes into his son`s room to wish him goodnight. His son is having another nightmare - Santa again wakes his son. The son this time says that he had dreamt that his grandmother had died. The father assures the son that she is fine and sends him to bed.

The son this time says that he had dreamt that his daddy had died. The father assures the son that he is OK and sends the boy to bed.
Santa goes to bed but cannot sleep because he is so terrified. The next day, Santa is scared for his life- he is sure is going to die. After dressing he drives very cautiously to work fearful of a collision. He doesn`t eat lunch because he is scared of food poisoning. He avoids everyone for he is sure he will somehow be killed. He jumps at every noise, starts at every movement and hides under his desk.
After days work, upon walking in his front door, he finds his wife, Jeeto, 'Good God, Dear, ' he proclaims, 'I`ve just had the worst day of my entire life! '
Jeeto responds, 'You think your day was bad, this morning my ex-boyfriend dropped dead on the front steps! '"

178,Emotion,FunnyPoemsThisFunnyLifePoembyMichelleTiddy,"Isn't life funny sometimes?
The ups, the downs,
The smiles, the frowns
The utter beautiful confusion
We find ourselves in?
When doors close and others open
When the rainclouds disperse
And the sunshine warms your face
Rainbows dancing in your garden
But you can't hold that pot of gold?
And then there's love.. love?
What is that? Is it a mutual sharing
A pairing of souls that 'match'
A slow dance in your irises
And a flash of lightning in your heart?
Or is it a cold, harsh thunderstorm
That doesn't abate, that ultimately
Leads to that word, 'hate'?
I don't like that word, really no
Hate isn't something for me
But I enjoy living, and feeling
Even if that feeling is often
Hard and difficult to understand
And faith, when held in your hand
Is so fragile, delicate and pure
This tango of life, this passion
That jumps into my heart and spins
Trips over itself, haunts me
Is all I ever want to feel, to be..
And I am so unashamedly thankful
To everyone that has ever touched me
And made me, Me.. otherwise
What would I be? Just another lost soul
Walking along the road of life
Without ever scuffing their feet
I love that my soles have blisters
And that scars are worn with pride
That this happy, fantastic wonderous ride
Is a journey I'm glad I didn't miss
It is surely, utterly, bliss"

Now even the animals
have joined in the game

181,Emotion,FunnyPoemsFunnyButNotSoFunnyPoembyMaryLouiseMannGabumpa,"Funny am I
How at this point of my life
That I'll ever see such as these
That people find it humorous
Of which I don't, at least, not as much
To live a life of folly.
Funny is it
How this world evolve with things
Looking real when everyone knows
That it isn't all there is to it
Wanting 'em with their life at stake
Wishing like nothing in carelessness.
Funny, but not so funny
For people could think as such
Like no one will know of it;
For people could do as such
Like there is no a payback for it;
Funny, but not so funny.
Funny, but not so funny
When such a time comes
As the world evolves
So is what have been sown
May not be at your lifetime
But to the lives of the generation to come.
Funny, but not so funny
When given a time to live
But only not many have the thought of it
Living a life just to get by
Is not what accounted for
But living under the will of God.
Funny, but not so funny... at least, not just yet."

Others get hurt
Some even cry and forget about their existence
Unlike my funny man
He is always happy
Laughing and cracking jokes all the time
Amazing how funny he is
When in trouble he stays calm
He stands still and plans ahead
No time for worries
His presence hinders me from remembering
all snares the world brings
Because of him I refuse to think
the world contains stubborn men
His funny stories never cease
and my happiness will last forever with my funny man
Little by little he is turning me into a funny woman
I can feel the changes in me
There is always a smile on my face
Whenever I talk, he laughs and becomes happier
I know I am his funny woman
What a pleasure to have my funny man around!"

185,Emotion,FunnyPoemsMyDaddysSoFunnyPoembyDeidreDixon,"My daddy’s so funny; always making me laugh
But, he’s the best daddy anybody could have
Every time he comes around he has something funny to say
On days when I feel down daddy can always makes my day
My daddy’s so funny even when he’s not trying to be
He has a way with words and gestures that always tickles me
He makes funny expressions, and he’s so witty too
He’s so funny he’ll make you forget you were feeling blue
My daddy’s so funny, but he is also sweet
He will do anything to help someone else; even get them off the street
You can find him givin’ change, or just standing up talkin’
To a person that most people would look at and just keep on walkin’
My daddy’s so funny, but he is such a good provider
He would do anything to take care of his family, even use the car like a taxi driver
I’ll never forget the time he got up at 5: 00 in the mornin’
He walked me all the way to my train stop, even though it was stormin’
My daddy’s so funny, but helped raise us girls so well
When my mama told us “no, ” we couldn’t run to him and tell
He taught us to be dainty and to act like ladies
He was always involved in our lives from the time that we were babies
My daddy’s so funny, but he takes good care of my mother
No matter how tough times would get, he always stood by her
He has been with her for more than 50 years
With her he has shared much marital bliss and many tears
My daddy’s so funny, but there is something you should know
He might laugh and joke a lot, but he takes life seriously though
His personality and the things he does are not for him to be seen
He just is who he is, and really loves people; from that we can all glean
My daddy’s so funny, when you ask him what he has to give
He’ll tell you in a minute, “I got mo’ cold cash than you got days to live! ”
My daddy is so funny, when I just think about him I laugh
I thank God for my daddy, one of the greatest gifts any girl could have."

that people take with them,

I am assuming she took them with her

I once found a five hundred-page novel

I’m thinking the person who left it there
must have brought his bed.
He would have needed it

Isn't it funny?
The world we are living in is just a dream
We are bad
We are doing evil
We waste our time running for money
We waste our time trying to get famous
But we don't see whats real
We don't realize the real person we are
We know the fact yet we don't notice it

Just think
You may die tomorrow
No money
No fame
No fun
No evil

Thats what we don't realize
Nothing is for granted
Not even our life
We may die tomorrow
So be a better man and don't live for life
Be a better man live for the death

I wanna get this clear

192,Emotion,FunnyPoemsJullyTheFunnyDogPoembyMeriamJoseph,"I had a little puppy dog,
He was Jully the funny dog,
He did walk and sleep and run with me,
All I had to do was keep him clean.
He was really scared of my cat,
He used to hide under the mat,
He barked a lot when he saw the ants,
He used to rip off my Uncle’s pants.
He hates the cow in the farm,
There’s not one day he didn’t bring down the farm,
The cow was angry with him one time,
That she poked him with her horns and went far aside.
If someone shouted at me once or twice,
He would bark and bark at him more than a thrice,
A chick once he tried to swallow,
But, poor me! He couldn’t do more than a hallow.
When it is bedtime, he slept with me,
The blanket went to him rather than me,
He is good example that barking dogs never bite,
But do remember, his bark is worse than his bite.

193,Emotion,FunnyPoemsAStoryOfFunnyStudentsPoembyRajaramRamachandran,"In the good old system,
It was the usual custom,
Where teachers lived,
Their students stayed.
The students, beside studies,
Did teachers' household duties,
Be it any work indoor,
Or it was an errand outdoor.
Once, ten students brainless,
Joined a teacher useless,
In a remote village house,
Under the care of his spouse.
They watched one day,
A red hot spoon, the lady
Dropped in a water pool,
For the spoon to cool.
When one of them got fever,
The rest poured cold water,
To cool him down, instead,
Fever raised hot and red.
The ten, once, crossed a river,
And to check up the number,
One stood outside the line,
And the rest formed the line.
The man outside counted nine,
And searched for the tenth one.
Every one did the same, in turn
Found they were short by one.
An old man heard their cry,
To help the fools free from shy,
Asked them to stand in line,
And counted right all the ten.
'A sewing needle, get
Me from the market, '
So ordered the Spouse
Of their master's house.
Four of them went out,
And a needle they bought,
But how it should be carried,
They disputed and argued.
A plantain tree they cut,
At the center pinned it,
And carried the tree home,
With mouth full of foam.
The lady chided them all,
And picked up the needle,
Cursing her ruling stars,
That brought her such fools."
194,Emotion,FunnyPoemsTheLFunnyWayPoembyVILMAXELIN,"You used to say
'Dreams never comes true'
You used to think
'You are just cheating me'
But time speaks by itself
and stronger feelings
can't be hidden so long
Now, I have seen your arm get turned
I have seen your sight changes
Cause now you can't keep blocking the sun
with a single finger
Cause now is too late to block your heart
I am already living there!
You know is truth
You know is reality
No matter time
No matter spaces
No matter how
No matter why...
Cause Love has no rules
Cause Love is law
Love has no limits
Love is an endless power
and change us in his weird way
This is Life
just suddenly changes
Getting us in love
Getting us on pain
Getting us into new learnings
Just getting us
Into his Funny way!"

to run out of breath
rested on a roof a bit
and catching me
observing it
gathered itself up
found its second wind

in a fury.
It snatched my hat

thinking it
was funny.
I didn’t think it was

197,Emotion,FunnyPoemsFunnyPoembyPatrickthepyropoetlittrell,"It's funny how hello is always accompanied with goodbye
It's funny how good memories can start to make you cry
It's funny how forever never seems to really last
It's funny how much you'd loose if you forgot about your past
It's funny how friends can just leave you when you're down
It's funny how when you need someone they're never around
It's funny how people can change and think they're so much better
It's funny how many lies can be packed in one ''love letter''
It's funny how people can forgive even though they can't forget
It's funny how one night can contain so much regret
It's funny how ironic life turns out to be,
But the funniest part,
Is that none of it is funny...
To me."
198,Emotion,FunnyPoemsFunnyPeoplePoembyMariaSudibyo,"Sometimes you get laugh
For something that really funny
Sometimes you could laugh
To something that doesn't intent to be funny
Sometimes you make laugh
Because everybody understand what's funny
Sometimes you laugh alone
Because you are the only one that think it's funny
Sometimes you try to laugh
Just to be looked funny
Sometimes you are forced to laugh
Despite it isn't funny
Sometimes you can't help to laugh
Even though it is not actually funny"

203,Emotion,SilverPoemsSilverOnTheTreePoembyRobertRorabeck,"I cannot think anymore, as happy as if’
I were with a woman, in the banking of the
Higher earths, amidst the alabaster aspens,
The columns for the celebrations
Of the cast of angels,
For in the blanketing nimbus,
The rosy swirl like that of the seashell’s
Inner ear, the peaceful colloquialisms
Of people who live so near the sea
They cannot tell their lives apart from
The otter’s clever play in seaweed beds,
For it is all of one season now,
The clever dating calendars give no hope:
And holidays could come at anytime,
Or none at all,
As the ancient berths of maritime traders
Trundle upwards in the darkness,
And horse-like skeletons split the
Infant grave, braying in the gray snows
As the wolves clean off the last
Of the clever meat, riding them:
The clock has wound down, and
The laughing man on top of it has
Breathlessly drunken his tasteless wine
And let us in:
Through the secret corridors where changing
Maidens run, the sea is butchered
By a dull sword and makes no sound.
There is silver on the tree
At the end of the path a long ways down,
Where not a single thing moves
At the foot of the house.
The ladies of aristocracy with ruined names
Have drunken their poisons under the lee,
And now sleep with a bluish sheen,
The opal necks rotting the speechless marble.
In this world,
How can you say a single thing
And not be driven away by the stockless kind.
As the heroes have risen up victoriously
Many times, now they grow old
And the greatest worm comes,
A long crimson train chewing coal,
So there is nothing to be done now,
As we are old and cotton haired,
Given over to the infant’s nameless whisperings,
But to open the door and let it in."

Since we had become medicos!
We can't believe the fleeting time
That changed us, and the world around.
Those years when we had joined this place,
It was not full of comforts much;
But now our Alma Mater is
A med-city within city!
How time has changed the landscape past!
New blocks have sprung up very fast;
A few teachers who taught us here
Remain slogging for students dear!
The knowledge they had shared with us
Has made us whatever we are;
We thank our teachers dear from heart,
Who lit the lamps in our lives then.
The campus brings us ev'rgreen thoughts
Of days when we were students here;
Despite the toil and struggles past,
We are better than what we'd thought!
We see our teachers somewhat old;
Whatev'r they told us was like gold;
We see our batchmates' kith and kin;
Our life on earth has been a win!
Our hearts are filled with emotions
Of pleasant thoughts of our stay here;
Though we may change akin fashions,
Our love for Alma Mater's clear!
We thank the Management, Trustees,
Who did so much to make us, Docs;
We thank those who helped treat disease,
And God, who made us priceless rocks!
Our job on earth is just begun;
We love to serve our sick brethren;
There are more good things to be done;
We want to make our earth, heaven!"

Laughed at the crowd. ""The nails are iron,"" he
said, ""You are cheap. In my country when we crucify
we use silver nails. . ."" So he went jeering. They
did not understand him at first. Later they talked about
him in changed voices in the saloons, bowling alleys, and
churches. It came over them every man is crucified
only once in his life and the law of humanity dictates
silver nails be used for the job. A statue was erected
to him in a public square. Not having gathered his
name when he was among them, they wrote him as John
Silvernail on the statue."

Those were the times of challenges;
Those were moments, we can’t forget!
Those were the happiest days in life;
Those were the times of great resolve;
Those were the years we loved the most;
Those were the dreams that came so true!
Our Management was great from start;
Our teachers taught ‘medical art’;
Our college then looked not so vast;
Oh, how we miss the life that’s past!
And we were just a little batch!
We turned out to be ‘prized a catch’!
Our college life can’t come again;
Our teachers put us in right lane.
We did not have much capital;
We did not have own hospital;
We saw few patients in the ward;
Nevertheless, we worked just hard.
And God had blessed us for His part!
We smile and laugh with good a heart;
We love our teachers who taught us;
They shared their knowledge without fuss!
God, bless our Doctor Teachers dear!
’Tis nice to see them still, so near;
They sacrificed in nobler ways;
God grant them health and peaceful days!

Well to do, or merciless goon?
Noon day sun, or midnight gloom,
What spells success, or imminent doom?
We are all the same, yet, not the same,
Black and white, what's in a name?
Born to live, or born to die,
Why do some laugh, while others cry?
If, in his image, we all are made,
Why do some prosper, whlie others fade?
Why are some chained, while some are free,
Does he smile at you, and frown at me?"
212,Emotion,SilverPoemsSilverWindPoembyCarlSandburg,"DO you know how the dream looms? how if summer misses one of us the two of us miss summer-
Summer when the lungs of the earth take a long breath for the change to low contralto singing mornings when the green corn leaves first break through the black loam-
And another long breath for the silver soprano melody of the moon songs in the light nights when the earth is lighter than a feather, the iron mountains lighter than a goose down-
So I shall look for you in the light nights then, in the laughter of slats of silver under a hill hickory.
In the listening tops of the hickories, in the wind motions of the hickory shingle leaves, in the imitations of slow sea water on the shingle silver in the wind-
I shall look for you."

My melodious joy, my silver horn!
These many long years my constant friend,
Together let our toiling end.
Yet fain would I ask (were mine the choice)
For a moment of strength to give thee voice--
One silvery peal ere life shall cease;
But not for war--for blessed peace.""
Yes! once again ring, sweet silver horn
That long ago rang on battle morn--
From vale and glen that summon'd then
To arms! to arms! a thousand men.
For peace ring now! for peace ring high!
Ring a welcoming peal that shall not die
Till mountain and mound, the earth around,
Responsive songs in echo sound.
""Thy whispers I hear, my silver horn!
My melodious joy, my silver horn!
They comfort me oft with such control,
Methinks thou hast a living soul.
Then cherish we both one calm content;
For the land that we love our powers were spent;
And o're the turf that greens our grave,
For ages may her banner wave.""
""I kiss thee adieu, my silver horn!
My melodious joy, my silver horn!""
Then suddenly loos'd the bugler's clasp;
His kiss was but a dying gasp.
Yet marvels of power can love evoke:
At the touch of his lips the bugle spoke!
And wondrously sweet, and clear, and strong,
From thence outrang a silver song."
214,Emotion,SilverPoemsSilverPoembyWalterdelaMare,"Slowly, silently, now the moon
Walks the night in her silver shoon;
This way, and that, she peers, and sees
Silver fruit upon silver trees;
One by one the casements catch
Her beams beneath the silvery thatch;
Couched in his kennel, like a log,
With paws of silver sleeps the dog;
From their shadowy cote the white breasts peep
Of doves in silver feathered sleep
A harvest mouse goes scampering by,
With silver claws, and silver eye;
And moveless fish in the water gleam,
By silver reeds in a silver stream."

Of early spring, and quiet again. Will
Speech disturb you? We're
Alone now; we have no reason for silence.
Can you see, over the garden-the full moon rises.
I won't see the next full moon.
In spring, when the moon rose, it meant
Time was endless. Snowdrops
Opened and closed, the clustered
Seeds of the maples fell in pale drifts.
White over white, the moon rose over the birch tree.
And in the crook, where the tree divides,
Leaves of the first daffodils, in moonlight
Soft greenish-silver.
We have come too far together toward the end now
To fear the end. These nights, I am no longer even certain
I know what the end means. And you, who've been
With a man--
After the first cries,
Doesn't joy, like fear, make no sound?"

Margaret, outside her insatiable appetite, she didn't complain to much.
Ms. Daalman had an unusual  craving for many utensils.
She appeared to favor them just as the witch had,
To consume many Hansels and Gretels.
She had consumed flatware in her body, in all 78 pieces,
Enough to serve 34 settings without the knives, in her digestive tract.
In fact,
Doctors diagnosed her with pica disease.
The metals, such as iron zinc,
-had attributed to her hunger pangs for years.
Margaret tolerated her pain, I think,
Though it most likely brought her tears.
Finally, she couldn't take anymore and had to have surgery.
Among the flatware taken out of body were forks and spoons.
She ate some of them in morning, at lunch, at dinner,
During the day and quarter, half, three quarter, and new moons.
Lucky she didn't have them pass,
For it would be an Amsterdam it, pain in the ass.

But there'll never be another

to dance within the fairy ring.
I leave the comfort of my chair
and go outside to find them there.
Already to commence the dance.
I watch them as they skip and prance.
I am too big to join the dance
but gladly given half a chance.
I would discard my human guise
and dwindle down to be their size
Titania points her wand at me.
I find I am quite suddenly.
Much  smaller than I used to be.
The fairy maids all laugh with glee,
each one wants to dance with me
I gladly join the revelry.
We dance until the morning breaks.
A single word is all it takes
to restore me to my own size.
Titania is very wise.
She weaves another magic spell.
I can recall but cannot tell.
When I awake in my old chair
Gripped in my hand I find a pair
of tiny silken, silver shoon
the colour of a bright new moon.
A little keep sake it would seem
to prove to me it was no dream.

To play the part in relation

Mistakes are considered of your own
For any mischief you are blamed
For any misdeeds you are shamed
Not a single act brings an honor
You are condemned therefore
The life stage is of different type
You can not shout or hype
Over the success in open
As it comes all of sudden
Sometimes you are driven
To the extreme corner even
Sometimes you are raised high
Your wings are ready to fly
Not all people are born with silver spoon
So many struggle hard in afternoon under hot sun
They are subjected to hard for not good return
But joy and happiness is sweet in turn

Play as character with trust
It is with intense desire to prove successful
Life is projected as beautiful and wonderful"
223,Emotion,SilverPoemsTheHouseOfDustPart0208TheBoxWithSilverHandlesPoembyConradPotterAiken,"Well,—it was two days after my husband died—
Two days!  And the earth still raw above him.
And I was sweeping the carpet in their hall.
In number four—the room with the red wall-paper—
Some chorus girls and men were singing that song
'They'll soon be lighting candles
Round a box with silver handles'—and hearing them sing it
I started to cry.  Just then he came along
And stopped on the stairs and turned and looked at me,
And took the cigar from his mouth and sort of smiled
And said, 'Say, what's the matter?' and then came down
Where I was leaning against the wall,
And touched my shoulder, and put his arm around me . . .
And I was so sad, thinking about it,—
Thinking that it was raining, and a cold night,
With Jim so unaccustomed to being dead,—
That I was happy to have him sympathize,
To feel his arm, and leaned against him and cried.
And before I knew it, he got me into a room
Where a table was set, and no one there,
And sat me down on a sofa, and held me close,
And talked to me, telling me not to cry,
That it was all right, he'd look after me,—
But not to cry, my eyes were getting red,
Which didn't make me pretty.  And he was so nice,
That when he turned my face between his hands,
And looked at me, with those blue eyes of his,
And smiled, and leaned, and kissed me—
Somehow I couldn't tell him not to do it,
Somehow I didn't mind, I let him kiss me,
And closed my eyes! . . . Well, that was how it started.
For when my heart was eased with crying, and grief
Had passed and left me quiet, somehow it seemed
As if it wasn't honest to change my mind,
To send him away, or say I hadn't meant it—
And, anyway, it seemed so hard to explain!
And so we sat and talked, not talking much,
But meaning as much in silence as in words,
There in that empty room with palms about us,
That private dining-room . . . And as we sat there
I felt my future changing, day by day,
With unknown streets opening left and right,
New streets with farther lights, new taller houses,
Doors swinging into hallways filled with light,
Half-opened luminous windows, with white curtains
Streaming out in the night, and sudden music,—
And thinking of this, and through it half remembering
A quick and horrible death, my husband's eyes,
The broken-plastered walls, my boy asleep,—
It seemed as if my brain would break in two.
My voice began to tremble . . . and when I stood,
And told him I must go, and said good-night—
I couldn't see the end.  How would it end?
Would he return to-morrow?  Or would he not?
And did I want him to—or would I rather
Look for another job?—He took my shoulders
Between his hands, and looked down into my eyes,
And smiled, and said good-night.  If he had kissed me,
That would have—well, I don't know; but he didn't . .
And so I went downstairs, then, half elated,
Hoping to close the door before that party
In number four should sing that song again—
'They'll soon be lighting candles round a box with silver handles'—
And sure enough, I did.  I faced the darkness.
And my eyes were filled with tears.  And I was happy."

So I could run on God's golden road.

And tipped with the purest of purest gold.
I could run faster than the speed of light
Everytime I placed them on my feet.
The feeling they gave me when I ran
Was a feeling noting could ever beat.
I joined in running Heaven's marathon
With my number placed on my back and chest.
To be viewed by all God's Angel's
Cheering me on to finish my spiritual quest.
I worked so hard to get to see this day
The one where I could run on God's golden streets.
And to hear the Angel's playing Heavenly music
While wearing those silver sneakers upon
My now Angelic feet."

229,Emotion,SilverPoemsSilverWeddingPoembyVernonScannell,"Silver Wedding
The party is over and I sit among
The flotsam that its passing leaves,
The dirty glasses and fag-ends:
Outside, a black wind grieves.
Two decades and a half of marriage;
It does not really seem as long,
Of youth's ebullient song.
David, my son, my loved rival,
And Julia, my tapering daughter,
Now grant me one achievement only;
I turn their wine to water.
And Helen, partner of all these years,
Helen, my spouse, my sack of sighs,
Reproaches me for every hurt
With injured, bovine eyes.
There must have been passion once, I grant,
But neither she nor I could bear
To have its ghost come prowling from
Its dark and frowsy lair.
And we, to keep our nuptials warm,
Still wage sporadic war;
Numb with insult each yet strives
To scratch the other raw.
Twenty-five years we've now survived;
I'm not sure either why or how
As I sit with a wreath of quarrels set
On my tired and balding brow.

but it not  overflows
a draining mechanism
Keeps it  Leveled
the seed of the desert
stored inside the chest
sleep, does not germinate
but is ready to sprout
Awaits the the well leak!
lost love, bad memories
their defenses, pain
perfectly filed and labeled
with all sorts of excuses
The desert awaits for ruling
The body sick  the killer mind
the lack of love for inhumanity
false kisses, false words
so kindly treasured by impunity
Await the excuses ending
Oh! So many waits and
i need a flood of water
One seed to sprout
before someone touch one's soft silver string"

A most ungodly thing
I will commit suicide
With the poison I keep
A night I will commit
My last dropp of blood
I will commit suicide
Because you did too
I will commit my suicide
Tonight at sunrise, on the
Roof of Hell, I will commit suicide
With a poison of Silver Sleep
As I take the syringe
And fill it with
The one dropp of the poison
I begin to taste it before it touches skin
The syringe is filled
I place the needle in my skin
And I press the back of the syringe down
The silver liquid passes through my system
I feel no pain
I am now dieing
Lights show around me
As blood passes my lips
The one I love is next to me
But I can no longer hear his voice
My eyes close and I see only darkness
My commitment to suicide has been fore filled.
I dropp the syringe as I fall
To the city street below me
The poison from the Silver Sleep
Is now upon me forever."

And succeeds in showing
you care
The old loved smile, familiar now
A hint of the thoughts we share
Twenty five years, a long time once
Now folded in the immediate past
Who would have thought,
on our wedding day
A quarter century would go so fast
The champagne flows, as it has
so often before
I touch wood and silently call
The fates to ensure
That they be kind and destiny mind
Where we go and how
This journey is not half-way yet
As we look back now
Let us celebrate, by all means
Out life together this while
But the best is yet to be
Say your eyes, your smile"

237,Emotion,SilverPoemsSilverLinesPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"Sky was studded with dark clouds,
Rushing all over with big sounds,
Impeded danger of heavy down pour,
Adding of woes to already poor,
I never felt so poor and helpless,
Why He was using the goodness?
Tearing apart the dark clouds,
Who were waiting for flash pounds?
She was kept bonded behind the dark,
Would have been freed with little spark?
There were silver lines ready to burst,
I had full faith and bestowed trust,
Suddenly it took dramatic turn,
Sun rays were making complete return,
Sky was lit with bright sun shine,
She stood there smiling for the while,
I couldn’t understand the simple massage,
Why clouds disappeared while making passage?
May be it was temporary phase?
I thanked God and took it with complete ease,
There was impeding danger like dark clouds,
I was slowly loosing my ground,
Love was HIS blessings and newly found,
All agreed for union and came round,
I wish it to happen with all my friends,
Who wished me success and flowers send?
My story was not success but had happy end,
Turning to HIM for success was not new but good trend"
238,Emotion,SilverPoemsTheMoonInSilverGloryShonePoembyJohnNewton,"The moon in silver glory shone,
And not a cloud in sight;
When suddenly a shade begun
To intercept her light.
How fast across her orb it spread,
How fast her light withdrew!
A circle, tinged with languid red,
Was all appeared in view.
While many with unmeaning eye
Gaze on thy works in vain;
Assist me, Lord, that I may try
Instruction to obtain.
Fain would my thankful heart and lips
Unite in praise to thee;
And meditate on thy eclipse,
In sad Gethsemane.
Thy peoples guilt, a heavy load!
When standing in their room
Deprived thee of the light of God,
And filled thy soul with gloom.
How punctually eclipses move,
Obedient to thy will!
Thus shall thy faithfulness and love,
Thy promises fulfill.
Dark, like the moon without the sun,
I mourn thine absence, Lord!
For light or comfort I have none,
But what thy beams afford.
But lo! the hour draws near apace,
When changes shall be o'er;
Then I shall see thee face to face,
And be eclipsed no more."
239,Emotion,SilverPoemsSilverKeyPoembyJessicaLeonard,"I closed the door to my heart
threw the silver little key
into the great big rapied waves
of the pacific ocean
i went on my way out in
the world of unknown
never going to have the same heart again
He walked though the hot sand
leaveing foot prints for
the world to see swam out in the rapied waves of the ocean
to find the little silver key
to this day he is still seaching
for the little silver key
fighting to find it."
240,Emotion,SilverPoemsSilverCoinsPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"Silver coins piled on the table
just enough to get him through
nights of sleeping in the stable
working daylights with the crew.
He had killed the great Falzini
fastest gunman in the west,
first he blew away his wienie
next slug hit him in the chest.
He would hang if they did catch him
though the Sheriff was a drunk,
and the one who could just match him
had been taken from his bunk.
Suddenly, the horses heard him,
sneaking in just like a thief.
Half asleep it briefly stired him
then he came to major grief.
Bullets from a big revolver
tend to shorten human lives
this one was a problem solver.
He had come to take the coins."

Fallen shadows cast upon mankind.
Silent hopes and dreams of reality.
Cast forth with silver silence.
Set adrift upon milk fed shores.
Calling forth the inner shadows.
Setting the fallen idol in raptures.
Casting spells which reflect kindness.
Sunken fallen empty hollow ship.
Cast forth the raptures into silence.
Empty bottomless silence, king of hearts.
Fallen idols again sound to silver silence.
Beat upon the wind swept shores of life.

244,Emotion,SilverPoemsSilverLiningPoembyDavidHarris,"They say every cloud
has a silver lining
and every true friend
a heart of gold.
In some moments
of distress,
we do not often see
what is there before our eyes.
Our judgement is clouded
and our worries conceal
what others try to give us
in hope and unconditional love.
The silver lining in our friends
is not always visible
and sometimes we are too blind
to see it there.

With mountain ranges, silver peaks background
The wayfarer much wonder-struck does stare
A dream appears to have come true but rare
A road that winds through thick forest is found
A glorious city spired gleams up there
The road is lined by silver birches fair
And deer so freely grazing here are found
The wayfarer much wonder-struck does stare
The smell of musk and berries fills the air
In trance, the traveler walks the road dumbfound
A glorious city spired gleams up there
The rain-cast skies have clouds like silverware
The heavenly scene is haunting holy ground
The wayfarer much wonder-struck does stare
To reach the dream-like city, all would dare
No wonder all who’ve seen the place are bound
A glorious city spired gleams up there
The wayfarer much wonder-struck does stare"
247,Emotion,SilverPoemsMySilverBellPoembyAlmediaKnightOliver,"Just look at that sweet thang
wearing that tight silver wrap!
At a table nearby, he sat, inhaling
and exhaling smoke rings
eyes sparing not a minute
off that sweet southern bell.
yet keeping
not his desire tightly
under his cap, or his
dazzling red eyes off her
bell-shape bottom, and
salavating like pavlo's dog.
He grabs and held her tight!
Peeled off her shiny wrap-
completely exposing her milk
chocolate body.
Extending his trembling hands
to meet her offer, beads of moisture rising
like the morning dew, cooling his forehead.
The hard-eating chocoholic
grabbed silver-bell off the table,
tossed It into his waiting mouth,
circled it with his tongue, the
milk chocolate flowing down his chin
He smacked his lips in delight...:

The last still hour soft-fallen from the stars.
To-morrow I may kneel and touch thy feet,
O Rose of all Shiraz.
Lay wide thine amorous lattice to the south,
O Silver Rose, when roses breathe thy name,
And thou at dawn shalt feel upon thy mouth
The kiss I dared not claim.
Discrowned, dishonoured, reft of pride and power,
From the red battle where they hailed me lord,
O Silver Rose, O sweet Pomegranate Flower,
I turn me to their sword.
Life hath so held me to an empty part,
Life hath so snared me, bound and made me blind.
To-morrow I may rest upon thy heart,
For death shall prove more kind."

Of braggart bugles cry it in—
What is sound? Nature’s round
Makes the Silver Jubilee.

Five and twenty years have run
Since sacred fountains to the sun
Sprang, that but now were shut,
Showering Silver Jubilee.

Feasts, when we shall fall asleep,
Shrewsbury may see others keep;
None but you this her true,
This her Silver Jubilee.

Not today we need lament
Your wealth of life is some way spent:
Toil has shed round your head
Silver but for Jubilee.

Should have pealed with welcome, Wales,
Let the chime of a rhyme
Utter Silver Jubilee."

An Hour to rear supreme

Then dangle from the Housewife's Broom--
His Boundaries--forgot--"

a malevolent pixie sits,
with rod in hand,

His line of silver thread,

holds the magic of the world,
forgotten by mortal command.

inches above the waters,
of the silver lake of dreams."

For time has seized my youth
I’ve lost the count of seasons passed -
The mirror shows the truth
With eyes that sleep in long repose
And limbs now void of tone -
The years have taken full their toll
As I am older grown
Yet in my heart there is a space
Where time does not accrue -
Where youthfulness does ever shine
And all the world is new
Where passion moves as much as when
My years were counted less -
And love does stir my weary soul
To sing with joyfulness
There too is set within my heart
A brightling star that shines -
And sweet the wine I’m sipping from
Fresh fruit upon the vines
So I will raise a glass to youth
And all the joy it brings -
Will sing a song to celebrate
The freedom of its wings
Oh, I will sing, yes I will sing
A song in praise of Spring
For Spring is ever in my heart
Such fortitude to bring
Then I will pray each morning that
Before I’m laid to rest
My soul shall ever be imbued
With youthful heart, so blessed"

They fail you so

And in the snow
Yes - in the snow
Where words do pale, but justice do

and no matter what you do,

with your hard earnt cash.
They’ll promise you things
you have always thirsted for,
but only at a price
and once they have you hooked,
they will try and entice you more
at an additional cost
and so it goes on and on
until you are broke or get wise,
then the silver-tongued devil
just promptly disappears
before your eyes.

258,Emotion,SilverPoemsTheLostPieceOfSilverPoembyDinahMariaMulockCraik,"HOLY Lord Jesus, Thou wilt search till Thou find
This lost piece of silver,--this treasure enshrined
In casket or bosom, once of such store;
Now lying under the dust of Thy floor.
Gentle Lord Jesus, Thou wilt move through the room--
So empty--so desolate! and light up its gloom:
The lost piece of silver that no man can see,
Merciful Jesus! is beheld clear by Thee.
Defaced and degraded, trampled in the dust,
Its superscription Thou knowest still we trust:
And Thou wilt uplift it and make it re-shine,
For it was silver--pure silver of Thine.
Loving Lord Jesus, Thou wilt come through the dark,
When men are all sleeping and no eye can mark.
Though 'clean forgotten, like a dead man out of mind,'
This lost piece of silver Thou wilt search for--and find."

It’s only silence no sound,
In the black it looks like,
There won’t be day but only night,
But wait soon will come the sun’s rays,
As after the darkest of nights is the brightest of days.
All doors are tightly locked,
Can’t be heard when knocked,
No where to go,
Nowhere to run,
Only wait in silence,
For death to come,
But don’t let hope die,
For it comes only when you try,
One door does open when all are shut,
Look for the open door get up.
No water far far away in desert sand,
No sign of life but only bare land,
It’s a bluff of eye, water’s sight,
There is nothing there that can cause delight,
But don’t give up and don’t dismiss,
The chance of finding a desert oasis.
Lead life with faith and hope,
Only then you can with tensions cope,
Think always tomorrow is shinning,
And that every cloud has a silver lining! !"

Glistening aromatic petals
Of a velvet-toned petal inlay
Whispers of private promises
Softly move throughout this space
Encounters of Origami lovers
Come at last face to face

Pulsing out the melodies
Of where true love begins
Moving on over the ages
Together forever oh so rare
But not impossible at all
When it comes to being

and I had given up.
You met me
and I took out the good china
from Grandma's hutch;
her gold-plated knives, forks and spoons
and the silver,
toasting you
that summer night
had both of us playing house.
I was the gourmet cook,
you were eating hearty
and wolfed down lustily my heart;
made me forget giving up
for giving it up
happily;
mostly from memory
and you were kind enough
not to notice
how awkwardly
and how long
my breathing took
to run to smooth.
It was the conversation
I believe
late into the night
that over-came me
re-mending those broken heart pieces
which laid themselves out carefully
on my dining room
table;
festooned
with grandma's
silver and gold-plated spoons.
We have gone on now through
paper, wood

golden
on our horizon;
nearing fifty years.

Locked, and the key withheld, as other girls

Not in a lovers'-knot, not in a ring
Worked in such fashion, and the legend plain—
Semper fidelis, where a secret spring
Kennels a drop of mischief for the brain:
Love in the open hand, no thing but that,
Ungemmed, unhidden, wishing not to hurt,

The shore is knocked but nothing more is there to claim
The destination is never thought of
Still it flows with carved path and pass through
Let us be the last to think
Before ship gives way and starts to sink
No hope should be allowed to fade
Until there is silver line to find the shade
Think if we were to spend life in easy manner
There was no scope to learn for beginner
As it was providing everything in smooth way
What was left then in life to try hard way?"
268,Emotion,SilverPoemsABreathOnTheSilverPoembyNickyLloyd,"Candlelight. Always candlelight
We smile at the delicate eccentricity of our Friday folly
Our working week worked, still you court reflections.
And still, for the sake of your smile, I embroider the truth
Crafting my daytime drudgery into a compelling drama.
Comedic, tragic and teasing, I know that you know what is real
Yet in your eyes your enchantment is authentic and alluring
Lovingly and knowingly you liberate my penchant for amusing anecdotes
And in doing so my employ parallels the insipid and the inspiring
Strange bedfellows and, as I recall, such was once upon a time said of us.
Wine. Always a fine wine
We grin at the devilish extravagance we could ill-afford
Our working class veneer ajar to a shard of misplaced and, so you thought,
Secret snobbery, though I name dropp wines as others name dropp exotic holidays
For this is our weekly escape, our humble haven, nurtured with quirky formality,
We know our roles. I put down my case and loosen my tie to invite your culinary
Majesty through my veins as I place a kiss on your right cheek, the same cheek that you always offer. This is, I ponder, what you perceive to be your ‘Best Side’ and I smile as I see only two sides to your loveliness, your inside and your outside. I turn
t’wards the stairs and say, as I always say, “Be with you in a minute my lovely”
Silver. Always a breath on the silver.
We laugh at my Aladdin moment as I polish the cutlery in the same timid and tender way I would dress our children’s playground grazes as if I too was feeling their pain. The table plan, my table plan, fastidious and engraved to memory, is arranged with orderly angles and sterile lines.  Did I ever ask you if it pleased you? Because, only now, can I concede the absence of any panache for the eye-catching that you could have so graciously and so effortlessly sprinkled upon the settings.   The likelihood is I never did ask and, as is my want, I will have assumed that such precision and attention to detail would have impressed you. And as I see you tonight, in this light, so ageless and timeless I feel an overwhelming urge to say sorry.
Napkins. Always napkins.
We marvel at our blessings ‘neath willowy dancing flame. Our memoirs modest,
Our pleasures treasured and tonight, as ever, Friday ours.
Our children flown and, with lives of their own, we turn to pictures. Leafing through albums I carefully and, unsurprisingly, catalogued, I wonder. Did you ever feel the urge to blithely launch our lifetime memories skyward and gaily sit amongst their random landings? But sweet flower that you are you suffer and indulge my symmetry.
And now we are weary and I have talked too much so sleep safe my lovely for so shall I.
On this the fortieth anniversary of our marriage
And the fourth anniversary of your death."

Those early Roman days, were not much
different,
When bribery, corruption and evil ways,
had also prevailed!
Politicians crossed the floor of the Senate, -
like politicians of our days!
Morality, human values, and actions and
deeds,
Had  price tags to satisfy human greed!
Both terrorists and traitors could be tempeted
by the devil,
To satisfy human lust and for the spread of
evil!
I often recall how Judas had betrayed,
By planting the traitors kiss on his Masters
face;
And sold Jesus to the Romans in a villanous
barter trade!
Thirty pieces of silver, became the price of
Judas soul,
For thirty pieces of silver, his Master he had
sold!
Thiry pieces of silver, was all that Judas got;
In exchange of hell fire and damnation as his
eternal lot!

272,Emotion,SilverPoemsNewSilverLinesPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"Parliamentary democracy is shield to cheat
With smile on face when they collectively meet
Countless hours are wasted on stalling the business
The emergence of rowdy scene usually surface
It was one in million chances to succeed
The entire country is engulfed with cast and creed
No one has spared the Indian soil with their known greed
How could one stay aloof when country is still not freed?
People are disgruntled with such type of liberal democracy
It has firmly established people’s supremacy
Everything is done on the name of people’s welfare
In fact their interest is compromised as who takes care?
The pilferage and looting of public money is on large scale
The judiciary has almost become beyond reach and failed
Some of the selected cases only come in for public notice
It is really a sad show for world’s largest democracy of promises
No country can prosper if loop holes are applied
The public is not kept well informed and information is withheld
They have right to know what is going on in the holy land
Who is their real protector and stands as friend?
It is uncertain about effective diplomacy
Each party is consolidating its position and remains busy
National interest is not their concern but a compulsion
The whole of nation’s priority is utterly in confusion
We really hope that nations may survive
Some of the good steps are to be taken and revived
The country needs to protect poor and their interest
The politicians must come forward and serve to their best"

274,Emotion,SilverPoemsATwinklingObnoxiousLittleSilverStarPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"She'd sent me stars, two handfuls in that myst'ry package.
And when I opened  to unpack they came like swarms
of silver insects, bright and ready to invade.
A silver touch, I thought, the carpet was a-glitter,
I picked them up, so slowly, one by one
with lingering movements, 'cause her hands had known them.
There was a storm that came, without much warning.
It took my love and whirled it into spheres
that could not nourish it and breathing had to cease.
While I was searching for the force of evil
that sent this devil of a murderer  and  thief,
all other life went on without consideration
of devastation that had plunged in misery
my very soul, its spirit had been breached.
Just like the hurt that tends to linger,
in nerves of amputated limbs of man,
this phantom pain can safely be dismissed.
It would take time, I knew  to lose the memories,
and storms are really, don't you know, just acts of God.
Back to my reading now, which had been pushed
onto back burners, there was never any time .
When I perceived the slightest, softest touch upon my leg,
a star had fallen on  a wound that she had healed.
This silver, little, recalcitrant and noticeable,
this twinkling and obnoxious bitty star,
it did just sit there, twinkling like a hooligan.
Until two teardrops fell upon it from above.
This story ends here as it has not been determined,
if too much time has gone for any hope of rescue.
It is well known that love must, like any living matter,
maintain a breath or face a certain, final death.
What if, I ask with anxious trepidation,
a surrogate has been up in those clouds.
Could it just be the life of love was spared?
And would you tell me, show me, kindly, then,
I plead with all you Gods,  by Dawn's first light?"
275,Emotion,SilverPoemsGlamourShotTheSilverBulletPoembyNicoleDSettemi,"The new trend is misery
The new look, reeks of despair...
The life-size Barbie doll
Her hair, now inky black
She shares her pain
Yes, she tells her story.
In all her madness
In all her ridiculous
Beautiful
Mad, fucked-up glory!
And, the people believe it.
They buy it, rather quick
Her mystique becomes the major seller
She is their topmost pick!
They, scream: ""screw 'em all! ""
""Hell, screw the rest! ""
And, they buy her a dollhouse
In a neighborhood for the best.
Sunset Boulevard—
The best of the worst
And, they wrap her in satin
And, they rent her a Hearse.
Premature death, for this Queen
In such an arduous, persistent pain—
They knew just what they were doing;
They mastered this whole game!
They sold their souls
They did it, in vain
They peaked and heightened
Because, they'd paid for their fame!
They walked the streets
As we screamed their names!
They had taken all—
In the illuminati game!
And, now bored with their own lives
They crave to feel her pain
They have nothing that is real
She has nothing but her fame!
Hang her face—
On your wall
All her pain
The teardrops, they fall...
""She is stylish!
She breathes hate! ""—
They bid, and they shout!
They scream prices!
They debate!
""Those tears are worth one million! ""
""That pain is worth ten more! ""
""And, why, I'd pay anything that they were asking! —
to capture the pained look on the face of that whore! ""
Eventually,
She'll be removed from the wall
And, her face will be shoved—
In some overstuffed closet, down the hall.
When she becomes aged news—
When her face, it becomes rather lame
When they seek a new victim and archetype—
Another lost soul to play their game!

277,Emotion,SilverPoemsWithSilverRaysPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"He not only listens but pays
Complete attention with silver rays
Make your path smooth and easy
So you don’t forget him despite being busy
Though you have different perception
God knows it from inception
Your needs and aspirations are all well known
Only you admit the faults and make it known
Why do you with all the helplessness?
Why you have to hide the feelings and face?
He is all the time there to take care
You have only to find him somewhere
You won’t find him at particular place
You must watch it with view to trace
If you fail in your attempt any case
It will be really bad time with critical phase
It has to be our regular prayer and feature
He has sealed our fate with signature
We got to obey Him and go to his shelter
It is with one aim to perform always better"

And looking forth beheld his flower-fair face,
Framed in his shining helmet as he sat
Sheathed in white armour, full of fearless grace,
Watching the coming of a threat'ning cloud,
Hueless and shapeless, that with stealthy pace
Was creeping towards him. 'O dear youth, beware!'
But answer made he none save laugh'd aloud.
'Beware,' I cried, 'it hides some hideous snare.'
At it he made—and vanished in the shroud,
Whence there broke forth, O Christ! so sharp a cry
Of dire defeat and mortal agony,
That all my blood ran back in every vein;
And when th' accursed blackness roll'd away,
Prone in the dust my lovely warrior lay,
Defiled, not dead; sore wounded—shamed—not slain;
His shining armour smirched with many a stain,
Filthy and foul, ne'er to be bright again."

Dreaming thoughts of controlled rain
Hidden flames bursting from youth
Music fills the night over again

The wind blows through me

Impression so kind
To bear in heart
For life time as an art
Love in later stage
That affects complete age
But clearly defines too
The role of divine power true
No body hunger
No personal anger
But still something short
To feel and honestly report
Yes something is felt
Fragrance from flower is smelt
There emerges wish for alliance
Close acquaintance and presence
I think it makes perfect combination
With solid bond and relation
Where two soul long for each other
He wishes long life for her
Not her wish alone
But gentle wind is blown
From direction unknown
Yet love and affection is known
Think about His presence
In every gesture with essence
Love sparks some light
Where person feels it right
No where you may find
“Love is kind and blind”
There is no color or cast
Yet that emerges very fast
The creed matters less
Faith is no where to trace
Thee is bright sun shine
There is happiness in silver line"

To the silver birds of song
Silver world awakes not to pleasure
Not to rhyme
Silver world awakes to sorrow
To the silver tear drop, crying
And with every tear the color fades
And more silver becomes the day
Spindling more silver
The silver devils play
And in my castle I hear the cry
The sharp shrieks of broken delight
The blinding light
The shivering fright
And in my castle I hear the wind
That humbles the calls
That corrodes my walls
The silver hissing wind
Driving nails into my coffin
The silver hissing wind
A dead heart will never soften
Meaningless are my dreams
Evanescent dreams
Grey clouds
Silver world
Faded clockwork, clicks
The hour passes, the hand ticks
And I awake into my dreams
Decadent reality, bursting seams
The clock now stops and forever so
Till I return but I shall not go"

In sunny waves of auburn glow;
As graceful on thy hoary head,
Has time the robe of honor spread,
And there, oh ! softly, softly shed,
His wreath of snow!
As frost-work on the trees display'd,
When weeping Flora leaves the shade,
E'en more than Flora, charms the sight;
E'en so thy locks, of purest white,
Survive, in age's frost-work bright,
Youth's vernal rose decay'd!
To grace the nymph, whose tresses play
Light on the sportive breeze of May,
Let other bards the garland twine,
Where sweets of ev'ry hue combine;
Those locks rever'd, that silvery shine,
Invite my lay!
Less white the summer-cloud sublime,
Less white the winter's fringing rime;
Nor do Belinda's lovelier seem,
'A poet's blest, immortal theme',
Than thine, which wear the moonlight-beam,
Of rev'rend time!
Long may the graceful honors smile,
Like moss on some declining pile;
Oh! much rever'd! may filial care,
Around thee, duteous, long repair,
Thy joys with tender bliss to share,
Thy pains beguile!
Long, long, ye snowy ringlets, wave,
Long, long, your much-lov'd beauty save!
May bliss your latest ev'ning crown,
Disarm life's winter of its frown,
And soft, ye hoary hairs, go down,
In gladness to the grave!
And, as the parting beams of day,
On mountain-snows reflected play;
And tints of roseate lustre shed;
Thus, on the snow that crowns thy head,
May joy, with ev'ning planet, shed
His mildest ray!"

are locked our golden dreams
waiting patiently for us

Dreams of love everlasting
to last us through our days,
dreams of happiness for evermore,
to let us smile through our life’s troubles.
They lay within the silver shadows
locked away in the recesses of our mind,
those golden dreams we dream about
from time to time.
The meandering wasteland,
within our shell of eternity,
where our dreams sleep,
awaiting us to awake them to make their escape.
The key is in us to unlock them
from within the silver shadows
where our golden dreams await
to be free to come true.

your father makes it and you mother polishes it

some fruits and bread and meat and water

when they finally leave you
as what this world demands, the usual flow of life and the fading
death, and you find yourself still
thinking and coping and running and stopping and resting and running and walking and curling and stretching what
is all there,
then everything is consumed, the silver platter has nothing, tarnished
and you begin to worry
what used to be is not anymore,
you think life ends just like that,
no
reality bites now, like a snake, or a rabid dog, and you despise the
silver platter
its lasting effect on you, how it made you weak and unthinking,
complacent
and unable to grow your trees and eat the fruits
to raise your goats and eat their meat
to live your own life
and be strong yourself in the darkness that comes
when you still want to play
it is not too late, take the silver platter and throw it away
or bury it
lest another one comes and takes it and be another victim
of its temporary glow that almost killed you"

And this is a known factor,
But only when it's churned,
Up floats the butter turned.

Amidst all the thoughts ridden,
But only when it turns clean
His vision inside can be seen.
A pure mind is always pure,
Despite a noble one falls poor,
Like a conch shell burnt in fire,
Still it remains white forever.
A diamond is the diamond best,
Even if it lies in a heap of dust,
And so shines a lotus found
That grows in a muddy pond.
The pure gold is heated up well,
Hammered before it gets its pull,
And twisted into different shapes
Of ornaments kept in shops.
The ups and downs we face,
In our life long endless race,
Are the God's golden efforts
So our Souls live in comforts.
Face any trouble with a smile,
For you're sure in the next mile,
To step over diamond or gold,
To brighten up your life, behold."

It'll show clear spring to you,
Forever show to you my broken heart.

309,Emotion,MirrorPoemsMirrorMirrorPoembyDanielleMariNidea,"Rainfall, lightning, thunder, sun
Condense gems which ocean shun
Greetings geese, planes goodbye
Friends I loved, friends they fly.
Waves connected, big and small
Sheet of glass where sapphires fall
Sapphires blue, then red, then black
Beams of white, the mirror cracks.
Silver lining in between
Something only few have seen
Horizon marks the bounds of map
The bounds of dream of which I nap.
Mirror, mirror, of the sky
Sea of which you go by
I row my boat forevermore
To find the non-existing shore."
310,Emotion,MirrorPoems0244theSoulsMirrorPoembyMichaelShepherd,"Do you wish to know what is your 'soul',
in all its glory, and its whole estate?
To know if it knows but a part, or All?
Its birth; its growth, its life - or lives; its fate?
Is it the watcher, even of itself?
Is it its own revealer, beyond words?
Can wise men tell us its true health and wealth?
If not, can we be sure that it exists?
For lack of witness to the soul's true bounds,
then, witness all the wonders of the world
of nature, beauty, law: then, what responds
in our self's mirror, is soul's map unfurled:
unbounded witness to its Maker; masked,
until for glorious proof of this it's asked!"
311,Emotion,MirrorPoemsTheMirrorPoembyYehudahHaLevi,"Into my eyes he lovingly looked,
My arms about his neck were twined,
And in the mirror of my eyes,
What but his image did he find?
Upon my dark-hued eyes he pressed
His lips with breath of passion rare.
The rogue! 'Twas not my eyes he kissed;
He kissed his picture mirrored there."
312,Emotion,MirrorPoemsInTheBathroomMirrorPoembyRalphBurns,"He continues to ponder
And his wife moves next to him.
She looks.They look at themselves
Looking through the fog.
She has a meeting she says in about
Thirty minutes, he has
Something too.But still she has
Just stepped out of the bath
And a single drop of water
Has curved along her breast
Down her abdomen and vialed in
Her navel then disappeared
In crimson.Unless they love
Then wake in love
Who can they ever be?Their faces bloom,
A rain mists down, the bare
Bulb softens above the glass,
So little light that
The hands mumble deliciously,
That the mouth opens
Mothlike, like petals finding
Themselves awake again
At four o'clock mid shade and sun."

Tell me what you see in me?
For what I see is a girl
She moves identical to me
But the girl in the mirror is nothing like me
She has no glow,
The glow that every girl needs
I see no beauty,
A plain Jane
Mirror say Mirror See
Tell me what you see in me?
What I See is not me
She has no hope in those little eyes
For she has seen too much
I see a girl who is not me
She does not smile
For her lips has spoken lies
Mirror say Mirror see
Tell me what you see in me?
Who is this girl in front of me?
For what I see is couldn’t be
Her skin is not perfect
For she has to many scars
She has been through too much
The girl in front of me is not the beauty I need
No, she is no Barbie
But a Rag Doll drug through life
Mirror say Mirror see
Is that really me?
I am no beauty
For I was never a gift
But a girl with a dream
Mirror say Mirror see
Will that ever be me?"
315,Emotion,MirrorPoemsMirrorPoembyGeorgeMurdock,"Like any other changeling
She was waiting to transform
Waiting for her arms to curl into flaps
Waiting for another set of legs to emerge
Standing before the mirror of transformation
With the decal in the upper corner of the glass
Of  a white winged unicorn
Suddenly the thought of morphing
Frightened her a bit
As she thought of the impossibility
Of being in the ballet
Or riding on an airplane to visit her aunt
She crossed her fingers
Canceling her wish to be a unicorn
She spun three times before the magic mirror
And closed her eyes
Hoping that when she opened them
She would just be herself
And wondering as she did this
Exactly who or what she was"
316,Emotion,MirrorPoemsTheMusesMirrorPoembyJohannWolfgangvonGoethe,"EARLY one day, the Muse, when eagerly bent on adornment,
Follow'd a swift-running streamlet, the quietest nook by it seeking.
Quickly and noisily flowing, the changeful surface distorted
Ever her moving form; the goddess departed in anger.
Yet the stream call'd mockingly after her, saying: ""What, truly!
Wilt thou not view, then, the truth, in my mirror so clearly depicted?""
But she already was far away, on the brink of the ocean,
In her figure rejoicing, and duly arranging her garland."
317,Emotion,MirrorPoemsMirrorMyMirrorPoembyobedSouza,"‘ All this I will give you, ’  he said, ‘ If you will bow down and worship me.’ (Mt.4: 10)
Mirror, my mirror!
My  self- made  image God!
It is  you I adore!
Selfishness has built an inner altar in my heart.
To you my ego, I deserve the best of me!
I promise not to question who I am,
As long  as  I walk in the red carpet,
A little money to my character is a big deal.
I was told  souls have no price,
So, it is just my  body, just bone and flesh.
Wholesale! Big savings!
My body, my sanctuary!
My image  at sale!
Nothing to do with me.
Don´t you see?  I am   a celebrity, brother!
Behold! How   fit I am  … and skilful!
I devote to you   everything I am.
Untill no more of me will be seen  - a rebirth -! The ‘  superme ‘!
Stardom is the paradise where  my soul will  rest.
My heaven  right  below my feet:
A star on the walk of fame,
A fallen  bright star!
Come see me! Watch me! I am  At your disposal!
My image … my body, my eyes, my hair, my beauty:
A corpse."
318,Emotion,MirrorPoemsTheTemperamentOfAPerfectMirrorSkewedPoembyJupiterSalt,"A resolute presentation on the edge of a dawn infiltration;
foundations firmly planted on a bed of ignorant fertility
Sullen condensation; a viscous fog totters in,
Seething and breathing its roiling, heavy, rolling sum,
sternly nurturing its torrential attrition:
physical, chemical; constantly, incisively
The morning, left uncomfortable, promises a cloudy noon.
Shadows within evergreen resplendence sigh with Night.
In fluid variegation, flowers bloom while brambles ensnare,
a bittersweet cooperation of estranged provocation:
collaborating selfishly, persistently inseperable,
unforgiving in the umbra of a crepuscular grudge.
Shivering silver sliver slips slowly to the sky,
ensorcelling wood and beast.
Deep forests' darkness claim the very earth
heedlessly flaunting its haunted emptiness.
nocturnal hunger: stalking, lusting,
challenges thorns and tramples flowers,
pursuing secret roots for repast; blind,
A haggard satisfaction; an unnecessary tempest
Sickening garden decomposed: a profusion of rot,
steaming mournfully out into the sombre midnight"

still outlines the joyous lass you were
those summers ago, when men stopped
in their tracks just to look at you.
Oh, how cruel time can be.
Now the only recognition you receive is;
'Mum, where's my football socks? '
'Mum, isn't dinner ready yet? '
Now you're mum.
When once you were darling.
Your sun set when he didn't take you
that way - any more.
So you lie beside him, remembering
how your passion rose with his.
And you eyes ask, 'What happened? '"

Outside fair costume--within ashes and filth,
No more a flashing eye--no more a sonorous voice or springy step;
Now some slave's eye, voice, hands, step,
A drunkard's breath, unwholesome eater's face, venerealee's flesh,
Lungs rotting away piecemeal, stomach sour and cankerous,
Joints rheumatic, bowels clogged with abomination,
Blood circulating dark and poisonous streams,
Words babble, hearing and touch callous,
No brain, no heart left--no magnetism of sex;                      10

I look at myself in the mirror today
But i cant recognize my face
It wasnt me anymore
This is not what i used to be
I asked my reflection,
who are you?
what have you done to me?
where's the old me?
to my surprise,
the image of the girl talk back
i am you..
i am what you've become..
do you remember?
how much hurt you kept inside?
you look so lonely
your eyes so sad
your skin looks old and dull
because you now dont know
how to give a smile..
you're lying.. Can't you see?
I always have good friends beside me..
A family to care and support
to give me warm hugs and comfort..
what else would i want?
you're the one whose lying? !
are you listening to yourself?
she talk back at me..
'who do you call friends? !
the same people who gives you a cold heart
a broken soul, those who ignore your presence? !
are they real? where are they when u need them? !
you fall apart alone? ! yeah, you've tried all your best,
just to make them happy,
you've given everything
you even scarifice yourself even if it means
that you have to give up something..
who do you call your family?
those who treated you as if they own your life?
telling you what to do?
who laughs at you when you try to express yourself?
those who think you're weak and always sick?
a sister who keep on mocking you?
and brothers who never respect you?
now tell me.. who's lying?
is it me or you? !
now.. do you know who i am?
do you remember my name?
I'm your alter-ego
stop pretending..
dont pretend your happy when ur not
now is the time to make them listen
be not afraid anymore..
stand up and fight for yourself..
and you will see..
that i am you..
and that you are me..
we're one soul..
yours is broken..
mine isnt.."
322,Emotion,MirrorPoemsObjectsInThisMirrorAreCloserThanTheyAppearPoembyRichardJackson,"Because the dawn empties its pockets of our nightmares.
Because the wings of birds are dusty with fear.
Because another war has eaten its way
into the granary of stars. What can console us?
Is there so little left to love? Is belief just the poacher's
searchlight that always blinds us, and memory just
the tracer rounds of desire? Last night,
under the broken rudder of the moon, soldiers
cut a girl's finger off for the ring, then shot her and the boy
who tried to hide under a cloak of woods beyond their Kosovo
town. Listen to me, - we have become words
without meanings, rituals learned from dried
river beds and the cellars of fire-bombed houses.
Excuses flutter their wings. Another mortar round is
arriving from the hills. How long would you say
it takes despair to file down a heart?
When, this morning, you woke beside me, you were mumbling
how yesterday our words seemed to brush over the marsh
grass the way those herons planed over
a morning of ground birds panicking in their nests.
When my father left me his GI compass, telling me
it was to keep me from losing myself, I never thought
where it had led him, or would lead me. Today,
beside you, I remembered simply the way you eat
a persimmon, and thought it would be impossible for each
dropp of rain not to want to touch you. Maybe the names
of these simple objects, returning this morning
like falcons, will console us. Maybe we can love
not just within the darkness, but because of it. Ours is
the dream of the snail hoping to leave its track on the moon.
we are sending signals to worlds more distant
than what the radio astronomers can listen for, and yet-
And yet, what? Maybe your seeds of daylight will take root.
Maybe it is for you the sea lifts its shoulders to the moon,
for you the smoke of some battle takes the shape of a tree.
On your balconies of desire, in your alleyways of touch,
each object is a door opening like the luminous face of
a pocket watch. Maybe because of you the stars, too,
desire one another across their infinite,
impossible distances forever, so that it is not
unthinkable that some bird skims the narrow sky where
the sentry fires have dampened, where the soldier, stacking
guns in Death's courtyard, might look up, and remember
touching some story he carries in his pockets, a morning
like this blazing through the keyholes of history, seeing not
his enemy but those lovers, reaching for each other, reaching
towards any of us, their words splintering on the sky,
the gloves of their hearts looking for anyone's hands."
323,Emotion,MirrorPoemsTheMirrorImagePoembyFernandoAlvarez,"I stare into the mirror.
Staring at what looks like me,
But isn't.
That's not my reflection.
It's the appearance I thought I hid.
It's the screaming I hear
Inside my head.
It appears in the mirror.
An apparition of the past.
The thoughts I feel
Became physical,
No longer mental.
My eyes stared back at me.
That sad, lonely face appeared.
And for an instant I saw my strength.
The strength I thought I lost
A once strong person on the outside
Becomes how she feels on the inside.
Lost, but with a glint of hope.
Barely there, tiny in size,
But nevertheless
The strength I need
To move away from the mirror image."

325,Emotion,MirrorPoemsMirrorMirrorPoembyMarkDillon,"When you look in the mirror
What do you see.
A reflection of yourself
or the opposite of thee.
Someone who finds fault
in the decisions that you make.
Who thinks that you're the imposter,
that you're the fake.
.
How do they deal with
the problems that you face.
Do they do it with
better logic and grace.
Or do they just ignore them and make light of it.
Bury their  head in the
sand and end up in the shit.
It leads me to think of Frosts 'The Road not taken'
When the morning comes and I awaken.
But who knows what way the future roads lay.
I am who I am, come what may."
326,Emotion,MirrorPoemsMirrorMirrorPoembyHarleyWhite,"If I were a galaxy in outer space
and wanted to find my reflection,
a mirror I'd seek so to peek at my face
while engaging in introspection.
Suppose I was millions of light-years away
in a constellation called Maiden
or Virgo, to use its correct sobriquet,
with a twin doppelgänger laden.
Might I query, ‘Oh mirror high in the sky,
midst linked arms and blueish trail flowing,
do you think my double is fairer than I?
What image is that you are showing?
‘Is it beauty you see gazing back at me,
mythopoeic in pondering mood? '—
Notwithstanding what seems to be harmony,
something's wrong with that calm attitude.
The peaceable aspect is masking a stage
of an astronomic collision
that began in an erstwhile earlier age
and will cause extensive revision.
In infrared, NGC five three three one
is a hundred billion times brighter,
it's said, than the luminousness of the Sun,
(hard to grasp for a starlit writer) .
A mirror speaks not, unless it is magic,
plus envisioning likenesses flipped.
What will that merger be, placid or tragic
in the redrafted galactic script?
The picture of two spirals interacting,
during a junction's coming to pass,
reveals the duo each other impacting,
thus to resemble a looking glass.
In the sequel by Carroll to Wonderland,
Alice climbs through to the other side
of the mirror, where she meets with peril and
Tweedledum and Tweedledee abide.
Yet our surroundings behave as reflector
much like the Moon with the tidal ebb.
Hence is futurity glimpsed as a specter
hither and thither weaving its web…
Humans cast shadows in all causal matters
touching on Nature's balance on Earth
fragilely wrought as a mirror that shatters.
Oh may we waken to life's true worth!"

Jumping around asking for milk
Whining severely, wanting food.

To the bottom, top and sides
Even to the skies. Consequently,
Our own mirror covered
By the thick, black cloth.
Could we, even once
Calculate and weigh
With sincere and truthful
All failures occur,
- On our own choices."

Nor bide in your breast pocket, dear.
For none your heart monopolize,
You favour such a nest of them.
So I but hope your roving eyes
Seek mine among the rest of them.
For saucy sprite, and noble dame,
And many a dainty maid of them
Will greet me in your mirror frame,
And share your kisses laid on them.

You hold me as the best of them.

To-night with all the rest of them."

You used to be so beautiful
Now youre skin and bone
Your voice is thick with toxins, I can hear it on the phone.
You'd be so proud if you actually cared
if you made the right choices and were actually there
I won; t blame myself anymore
And I'm done staring at the door
Just waiting for you to come back changed
to have your priorities rearranged.
In a world where you put your children first
is a world where my brother and I wouldn't have to hurt
And I worry every single day
that I'll lose my grip and become that way
But then I know its just a thought
I would never give up after how long I've fought
I don't want to end up like you
and I wont. I refuse.
Do you even know how much I've cried?
Over the hate and of the lies?
My mirror, mirror sets me free.
I'll never be like you
but forever will be me."

Looks sad and pale
that’s how shell die
Alone and frail
The girl in the mirror
smiling is she
She looks happy and joyful
Why shouldn’t she be
The girl out of the mirror
Unhappy in life
Is upset with herself
Keeps watching her knife

A beautiful human being staring right back at me
When I  move grade to grade, what has been shown?
my smartness and how much my progress has grown
When I read a book, cover to cover
I always go back to get another
Some may ask, how do I dress
I may answer, I dress to impress
When I go out I present myself with pride
you can tell by the way I walk, stride for stride
When you look in the mirror, what do you see?
I see a beautiful human being staring right back at me"

349,Emotion,MirrorPoemsTheMirrorInTheHallPoembyConstantinePCavafy,"The rich house had in the hall
An enormous mirror, very old;
Bought at least eighty years ago.
A very handsome boy, assistant at a tailor’s
(On Sundays an amateur athlete),
Was standing there with a parcel. He handed it
To someone of the house, and he took it inside
To fetch the receipt. The tailor’s assistant
Was left alone, and waited.
He went up to the mirror and began to look at himself
And put his tie straight. After five minutes
They brought him the receipt. He took it and went away.
But the old mirror which had seen, and seen,
In the many years it had been
In existence, thousands of things and faces;
The old mirror was glad now
And was proud to have received upon itself
That entire beauty for a few minutes."

She's familiar, yet unknown
She's reaching out to touch me
She's abandoned and alone
She's living in a nightmare
Her eyes are tightly shut
She can't stand to see her pain
Caused by those she used to trust
She tries to speak, and cry for help
But her words will not come out
It's like nobody can hear her
No matter how loud she shouts
I'm the only one who understands
The torture she's been through
Her mind's been toyed and played with
And her heart has been abused
Now if her heart is broken
Can I put it back in place?
Can I wipe away the teardrops
That are falling down her face?
Can I erase the memories
That are deep inside her mind?
Can I take away the hurting
That she's suffered all her life?
And can I make her smile
When all she does is frown?
Can i pick her up and hold her
When she's lying on the ground
Can I hide her imperfections
If they're all she ever sees?
How do I tell her she's pretty
If she doesn't know what it means?
And if she wants to be alone
Am I supposed to follow?
How do I turn the light on
If she's hidden in the shadow?
And if she turns to walk away
Do I try to pull her nearer?
How do i help the person
That I see inside the mirror?"

Your itch and quailing, nude greed of the flesh.
Love's breath in you is stale, worded or sung,
As sour as cat's breath,
Harsh of tongue.
This grey that stares
Lies not, stark skin and bone.
Leave greasy lips their kissing. None
Will choose her what you see to mouth upon.

That’s what I see

A drunkard I became
Now my poor family
Are looked on with shame
Empty bottles fill every corner
Money I have none
My wife and children go hungry
As I crawl around the floor
As the days grew longer
The worse I became
Bottle followed bottle
Perfecting my shame
I yelled and I shouted
Strange things did I see
But none were more stranger
Than a reflection of me"

Want us to see
But could not a clearer reflection

And breaks into pieces, you cannot glue,
Enticing people’s hearts, until they pass;
Succeeding in the hands of just a few!
You ought to handle it with supreme care,
Lest accidentally it falls and breaks;
Most times, it shows that life is still unfair,
Or mountains out of mole-hills, surely makes.
Sometimes, the silvering may much peel off,
Reflecting faces as weird as can be;
Sometimes, it makes you laugh or cry or scoff,
And shows that life can turn at times nasty.
Lucky are some to witness love life-long!
For most others, ’tis just a dainty song.

Silk threads wherewith sly Cupid strings his bow,

To Venus or to Psyche.

Uses no grizzled cords upon his bow.
How will it be when I, no longer fair,
Plead for his kiss with cheeks, whence long ago
The early snowflakes melted quite away,
The rose leaf died – and in whose sallow clay
Lie the deep sunken tracks of life’s gaunt crow?
When this full throat shall wattle fold on fold,
Like some ripe peach left drying on a wall,
Or like a spent accordion, when all
Its music has exhaled – will love grow cold?"

I look into every day, but now I see someone I don't know at all!
When I was young,
I remebered,
I would look for hours.
Now, as I grow older,
My face appears as ugly and dry as wilted flowers.
My wrinkles grow longer
And I spend much less
Time in front of you,
When I do,
I'm so blue.
You see, you can really tell I'm not as much of a Man as I once was,
It is hard to say,
But a plain fact,
As our body's fall apart,
We fight back.
We fight back with dyes, creams and powders,
Even some try selective operations to retard age,
Oh how wise is such a sage.
If the desired result it stop the process,
Who among us willing to start.
What is would take is implied consent,
You must give in and lament.
You no longer must linger,
Where you once did,
And if you do,
You can make a bet
That this too will be a great lament."

but i suddenly saw the beauty
I saw hope, something save my from my terror
i grow excited,
i dance around, hoping that i do not break it
hope that do not destroy this beauty
or seven years of bad luck will befall me,
but if i do not dance with it,
i also fear that it will no longer want me
it may betray and leave me lost once again,

Photon's path projects quantum leap, subjects

Mirror's muse reflects as mirror recollects
mirror switch reflects upon mirror which reflects on mystery of light.
Mirror thus protects mirror that projects
reflection that reflects on mirror which expects historical insight.
Mirror interjects texts, textures and contexts
chance elects, selects, checks and double checks for infinite delight.
Mirror's light directs life's mysteries, neglects
naught it interconnects as cause links to effects exciting to invite.
Mirror intercepts when mirror role reflects

Mirror pitch connects, collects and self respects,
perpetually perfects externals it bedecks with inner meanings' might."

374,Emotion,MirrorPoemsLadyAtAMirrorPoembyRainerMariaRilke,"As in sleeping-drink spices
softly she loosens in the liquid-clear
mirror her fatigued demeanor;
and she puts her smile deep inside.
And she waits while the liquid
rises from it; then she pours her hair
into the mirror, and, lifting one
wondrous shoulder from the evening gown,
she drinks quietly from her image. She drinks
what a lover would drink feeling dazed,
searching it, full of mistrust; and she only
beckons to her maid when at the bottom
of her mirror she finds candles, wardrobes,
and the cloudy dregs of a late hour.
Translated by Edward Snow"
375,Emotion,MirrorPoemsTheMirrorPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"A mirror hung upon a wall.
A man, quite handsome, also tall
stepped up to look inside the glass
and gave himself the nod, the pass.
He saw exquisite, handsome features
superior to all other creatures.
Black hair and pearl white teeth to smile
Amana suit completes the style.
His nails were short and manicured
flat stomach muscles had endured
so many sessions of the crunches
and, from inside,   Martini lunches.
Two diamonds hung from his sleeves
and maple golden rings, like leaves
adorned pink ears and looked expensive
his jewellery was quite extensive
and in addition, on his arms
two Rolexes, with loud alarms.
He stood and looked from head to toes
but did not know a mirror shows
to all the world just your outside
what counts is all the things you hide.

And lend glory to life sans the evil trace!"
377,Emotion,MirrorPoemsMirrorMirrorPoembySeanCHarrison,"Once again she stands motionless
Her eyes searching for something...
Something of beauty she can hold;
Everyday searching, too many times told it's not there.
So she, lost in that eternal stare
Peruses the fine lines, the brows, the cheeks.
But what she seeks is not found in a reflection.
She needs a stare deeper within
Where the ugliness lies snug
In a lack of hugs and affirming words;
A bonafide love for the awkwardness,
The less than perfect nose and the cheekbones not so high,
The words that don't come out quite right.
For the mirror is a terror to a dissatisfied, unsettled heart
That cannot see beauty beyond the physical glare.
She must learn one day to search much deeper there
Where she'll see contentment smiling,
Finally understanding this is the purest
Prettiest reflection ever known and ever shown."

382,Emotion,MirrorPoemsTheOtherSideOfAMirrorPoembyMaryElizabethColeridge,"I sat before my glass one day,
And conjured up a vision bare,
Unlike the aspects glad and gay,
That erst were found reflected there -
The vision of a woman, wild
With more than womanly despair.
Her hair stood back on either side
A face bereft of loveliness.
It had no envy now to hide
What once no man on earth could guess.
It formed the thorny aureole
Of hard, unsanctified distress.
Her lips were open - not a sound
Came though the parted lines of red,
Whate'er it was, the hideous wound
In silence and secret bled.
No sigh relieved her speechless woe,
She had no voice to speak her dread.
And in her lurid eyes there shone
The dying flame of life's desire,
Made mad because its hope was gone,
And kindled at the leaping fire
Of jealousy and fierce revenge,
And strength that could not change nor tire.
Shade of a shadow in the glass,
O set the crystal surface free!
Pass - as the fairer visions pass -
Nor ever more return, to be
The ghost of a distracted hour,
That heard me whisper: - 'I am she!'"

We don't, at all, remember.
To show our faces beautiful,
How much it's really useful?
Above the wash basin
The glittering teeth clean
We see first every morn,
Before the day starts on.
The curly hair to comb,
The mustache to trim,
The oily face to foam,
How it helps at home?
Is there any beauty parlor,
Or a fancy dress store,
Or a modern shop tailor,
With no full size mirror?
Inside the ladies hand bags,
Or the gents coat pockets,
How the tiny mirror hides,
For their face-touch up uses?
To see the distant stars,
Or to find the tiny microbes,
How it serves a giant telescope,
Or a small but sharp microscope?
Mirror, mirror everywhere,
With our life for it to share,
Thanks to the unknown discoverer
For this all-time useful mirror."

387,Emotion,MirrorPoemsSelfPortraitInAConvexMirrorPoembyJohnAshbery,"As Parmigianino did it, the right hand
Bigger than the head, thrust at the viewer
And swerving easily away, as though to protect
What it advertises. A few leaded panes, old beams,
Fur, pleated muslin, a coral ring run together
In a movement supporting the face, which swims
Toward and away like the hand
Except that it is in repose. It is what is
Sequestered. Vasari says, ""Francesco one day set himself
To take his own portrait, looking at himself from that purpose
In a convex mirror, such as is used by barbers . . .
He accordingly caused a ball of wood to be made
By a turner, and having divided it in half and
Brought it to the size of the mirror, he set himself
With great art to copy all that he saw in the glass,""
Chiefly his reflection, of which the portrait
Is the reflection, of which the portrait
Is the reflection once removed.
The glass chose to reflect only what he saw
Which was enough for his purpose: his image
Glazed, embalmed, projected at a 180-degree angle.
The time of day or the density of the light
Adhering to the face keeps it
Lively and intact in a recurring wave
Of arrival. The soul establishes itself.
But how far can it swim out through the eyes
And still return safely to its nest? The surface
Of the mirror being convex, the distance increases
Significantly; that is, enough to make the point
That the soul is a captive, treated humanely, kept
In suspension, unable to advance much farther
Than your look as it intercepts the picture.
Pope Clement and his court were ""stupefied""
By it, according to Vasari, and promised a commission
That never materialized. The soul has to stay where it is,
Even though restless, hearing raindrops at the pane,
The sighing of autumn leaves thrashed by the wind,
Longing to be free, outside, but it must stay
Posing in this place. It must move
As little as possible. This is what the portrait says.
But there is in that gaze a combination
Of tenderness, amusement and regret, so powerful
In its restraint that one cannot look for long.
The secret is too plain. The pity of it smarts,
Makes hot tears spurt: that the soul is not a soul,
Has no secret, is small, and it fits
Its hollow perfectly: its room, our moment of attention.
That is the tune but there are no words.
The words are only speculation
(From the Latin speculum, mirror):
They seek and cannot find the meaning of the music.
We see only postures of the dream,
Riders of the motion that swings the face
Into view under evening skies, with no
False disarray as proof of authenticity.
But it is life englobed.
One would like to stick one's hand
Out of the globe, but its dimension,
What carries it, will not allow it.
No doubt it is this, not the reflex
To hide something, which makes the hand loom large
As it retreats slightly. There is no way
To build it flat like a section of wall:
It must join the segment of a circle,
Roving back to the body of which it seems
So unlikely a part, to fence in and shore up the face
On which the effort of this condition reads
Like a pinpoint of a smile, a spark
Or star one is not sure of having seen
As darkness resumes. A perverse light whose
Imperative of subtlety dooms in advance its
Conceit to light up: unimportant but meant.
Francesco, your hand is big enough
To wreck the sphere, and too big,
One would think, to weave delicate meshes
That only argue its further detention.
(Big, but not coarse, merely on another scale,
Like a dozing whale on the sea bottom
In relation to the tiny, self-important ship
On the surface.) But your eyes proclaim
That everything is surface. The surface is what's there
And nothing can exist except what's there.
There are no recesses in the room, only alcoves,
And the window doesn't matter much, or that
Sliver of window or mirror on the right, even
As a gauge of the weather, which in French is
Le temps, the word for time, and which
Follows a course wherein changes are merely
Features of the whole. The whole is stable within
Instability, a globe like ours, resting
On a pedestal of vacuum, a ping-pong ball
Secure on its jet of water.
And just as there are no words for the surface, that is,
No words to say what it really is, that it is not
Superficial but a visible core, then there is
No way out of the problem of pathos vs. experience.
You will stay on, restive, serene in
Your gesture which is neither embrace nor warning
But which holds something of both in pure
Affirmation that doesn't affirm anything.
The balloon pops, the attention
Turns dully away. Clouds
In the puddle stir up into sawtoothed fragments.
I think of the friends
Who came to see me, of what yesterday
Was like. A peculiar slant
Of memory that intrudes on the dreaming model
In the silence of the studio as he considers
Lifting the pencil to the self-portrait.
How many people came and stayed a certain time,
Uttered light or dark speech that became part of you
Like light behind windblown fog and sand,
Filtered and influenced by it, until no part
Remains that is surely you. Those voices in the dusk
Have told you all and still the tale goes on
In the form of memories deposited in irregular
Clumps of crystals. Whose curved hand controls,
Francesco, the turning seasons and the thoughts
That peel off and fly away at breathless speeds
Like the last stubborn leaves ripped
From wet branches? I see in this only the chaos
Of your round mirror which organizes everything
Around the polestar of your eyes which are empty,
Know nothing, dream but reveal nothing.
I feel the carousel starting slowly
And going faster and faster: desk, papers, books,
Photographs of friends, the window and the trees
Merging in one neutral band that surrounds
Me on all sides, everywhere I look.
And I cannot explain the action of leveling,
Why it should all boil down to one
Uniform substance, a magma of interiors.
My guide in these matters is your self,
Firm, oblique, accepting everything with the same
Wraith of a smile, and as time speeds up so that it is soon
Much later, I can know only the straight way out,
The distance between us. Long ago
The strewn evidence meant something,
The small accidents and pleasures
Of the day as it moved gracelessly on,
A housewife doing chores. Impossible now
To restore those properties in the silver blur that is
The record of what you accomplished by sitting down
""With great art to copy all that you saw in the glass""
So as to perfect and rule out the extraneous
Forever. In the circle of your intentions certain spars
Remain that perpetuate the enchantment of self with self:
Eyebeams, muslin, coral. It doesn't matter
Because these are things as they are today
Before one's shadow ever grew
Out of the field into thoughts of tomorrow.
Tomorrow is easy, but today is uncharted,
Desolate, reluctant as any landscape
To yield what are laws of perspective
After all only to the painter's deep
Mistrust, a weak instrument though
Necessary. Of course some things
Are possible, it knows, but it doesn't know
Which ones. Some day we will try
To do as many things as are possible
And perhaps we shall succeed at a handful
Of them, but this will not have anything
To do with what is promised today, our
Landscape sweeping out from us to disappear
On the horizon. Today enough of a cover burnishes
To keep the supposition of promises together
In one piece of surface, letting one ramble
Back home from them so that these
Even stronger possibilities can remain
Whole without being tested. Actually
The skin of the bubble-chamber's as tough as
Reptile eggs; everything gets ""programmed"" there
In due course: more keeps getting included
Without adding to the sum, and just as one
Gets accustomed to a noise that
Kept one awake but now no longer does,
So the room contains this flow like an hourglass
Without varying in climate or quality
(Except perhaps to brighten bleakly and almost
Invisibly, in a focus sharpening toward death--more
Of this later). What should be the vacuum of a dream
Becomes continually replete as the source of dreams
Is being tapped so that this one dream
May wax, flourish like a cabbage rose,
Defying sumptuary laws, leaving us
To awake and try to begin living in what
Has now become a slum. Sydney Freedberg in his
Parmigianino says of it: ""Realism in this portrait
No longer produces and objective truth, but a bizarria . . . .
However its distortion does not create
A feeling of disharmony . . . . The forms retain
A strong measure of ideal beauty,"" because
Fed by our dreams, so inconsequential until one day
We notice the hole they left. Now their importance
If not their meaning is plain. They were to nourish
A dream which includes them all, as they are
Finally reversed in the accumulating mirror.
They seemed strange because we couldn't actually see them.
And we realize this only at a point where they lapse
Like a wave breaking on a rock, giving up
Its shape in a gesture which expresses that shape.
The forms retain a strong measure of ideal beauty
As they forage in secret on our idea of distortion.
Why be unhappy with this arrangement, since
Dreams prolong us as they are absorbed?
Something like living occurs, a movement
Out of the dream into its codification.
As I start to forget it
It presents its stereotype again
But it is an unfamiliar stereotype, the face
Riding at anchor, issued from hazards, soon
To accost others, ""rather angel than man"" (Vasari).
Perhaps an angel looks like everything
We have forgotten, I mean forgotten
Things that don't seem familiar when
We meet them again, lost beyond telling,
Which were ours once. This would be the point
Of invading the privacy of this man who
""Dabbled in alchemy, but whose wish
Here was not to examine the subtleties of art
In a detached, scientific spirit: he wished through them
To impart the sense of novelty and amazement to the spectator""
(Freedberg). Later portraits such as the Uffizi
""Gentleman,"" the Borghese ""Young Prelate"" and
The Naples ""Antea"" issue from Mannerist
Tensions, but here, as Freedberg points out,
The surprise, the tension are in the concept
Rather than its realization.
The consonance of the High Renaissance
Is present, though distorted by the mirror.
What is novel is the extreme care in rendering
The velleities of the rounded reflecting surface
(It is the first mirror portrait),
So that you could be fooled for a moment
Before you realize the reflection
Isn't yours. You feel then like one of those
Hoffmann characters who have been deprived
Of a reflection, except that the whole of me
Is seen to be supplanted by the strict
Otherness of the painter in his
Other room. We have surprised him
At work, but no, he has surprised us
As he works. The picture is almost finished,
The surprise almost over, as when one looks out,
Startled by a snowfall which even now is
Ending in specks and sparkles of snow.
It happened while you were inside, asleep,
And there is no reason why you should have
Been awake for it, except that the day
Is ending and it will be hard for you
To get to sleep tonight, at least until late.
The shadow of the city injects its own
Urgency: Rome where Francesco
Was at work during the Sack: his inventions
Amazed the soldiers who burst in on him;
They decided to spare his life, but he left soon after;
Vienna where the painting is today, where
I saw it with Pierre in the summer of 1959; New York
Where I am now, which is a logarithm
Of other cities. Our landscape
Is alive with filiations, shuttlings;
Business is carried on by look, gesture,
Hearsay. It is another life to the city,
The backing of the looking glass of the
Unidentified but precisely sketched studio. It wants
To siphon off the life of the studio, deflate
Its mapped space to enactments, island it.
That operation has been temporarily stalled
But something new is on the way, a new preciosity
In the wind. Can you stand it,
Francesco? Are you strong enough for it?
This wind brings what it knows not, is
Self--propelled, blind, has no notion
Of itself. It is inertia that once
Acknowledged saps all activity, secret or public:
Whispers of the word that can't be understood
But can be felt, a chill, a blight
Moving outward along the capes and peninsulas
Of your nervures and so to the archipelagoes
And to the bathed, aired secrecy of the open sea.
This is its negative side. Its positive side is
Making you notice life and the stresses
That only seemed to go away, but now,
As this new mode questions, are seen to be
Hastening out of style. If they are to become classics
They must decide which side they are on.
Their reticence has undermined
The urban scenery, made its ambiguities
Look willful and tired, the games of an old man.
What we need now is this unlikely
Challenger pounding on the gates of an amazed
Castle. Your argument, Francesco,
Had begun to grow stale as no answer
Or answers were forthcoming. If it dissolves now
Into dust, that only means its time had come
Some time ago, but look now, and listen:
It may be that another life is stocked there
In recesses no one knew of; that it,
Not we, are the change; that we are in fact it
If we could get back to it, relive some of the way
It looked, turn our faces to the globe as it sets
And still be coming out all right:
Nerves normal, breath normal. Since it is a metaphor
Made to include us, we are a part of it and
Can live in it as in fact we have done,
Only leaving our minds bare for questioning
We now see will not take place at random
But in an orderly way that means to menace
Nobody--the normal way things are done,
Like the concentric growing up of days
Around a life: correctly, if you think about it.
A breeze like the turning of a page
Brings back your face: the moment
Takes such a big bite out of the haze
Of pleasant intuition it comes after.
The locking into place is ""death itself,""
As Berg said of a phrase in Mahler's Ninth;
Or, to quote Imogen in Cymbeline, ""There cannot
Be a pinch in death more sharp than this,"" for,
Though only exercise or tactic, it carries
The momentum of a conviction that had been building.
Mere forgetfulness cannot remove it
Nor wishing bring it back, as long as it remains
The white precipitate of its dream
In the climate of sighs flung across our world,
A cloth over a birdcage. But it is certain that
What is beautiful seems so only in relation to a specific
Life, experienced or not, channeled into some form
Steeped in the nostalgia of a collective past.
The light sinks today with an enthusiasm
I have known elsewhere, and known why
It seemed meaningful, that others felt this way
Years ago. I go on consulting
This mirror that is no longer mine
For as much brisk vacancy as is to be
My portion this time. And the vase is always full
Because there is only just so much room
And it accommodates everything. The sample
One sees is not to be taken as
Merely that, but as everything as it
May be imagined outside time--not as a gesture
But as all, in the refined, assimilable state.
But what is this universe the porch of
As it veers in and out, back and forth,
Refusing to surround us and still the only
Thing we can see? Love once
Tipped the scales but now is shadowed, invisible,
Though mysteriously present, around somewhere.
But we know it cannot be sandwiched
Between two adjacent moments, that its windings
Lead nowhere except to further tributaries
And that these empty themselves into a vague
Sense of something that can never be known
Even though it seems likely that each of us
Knows what it is and is capable of
Communicating it to the other. But the look
Some wear as a sign makes one want to
Push forward ignoring the apparent
NaÏveté of the attempt, not caring
That no one is listening, since the light
Has been lit once and for all in their eyes
And is present, unimpaired, a permanent anomaly,
Awake and silent. On the surface of it
There seems no special reason why that light
Should be focused by love, or why
The city falling with its beautiful suburbs
Into space always less clear, less defined,
Should read as the support of its progress,
The easel upon which the drama unfolded
To its own satisfaction and to the end
Of our dreaming, as we had never imagined
It would end, in worn daylight with the painted
Promise showing through as a gage, a bond.
This nondescript, never-to-be defined daytime is
The secret of where it takes place
And we can no longer return to the various
Conflicting statements gathered, lapses of memory
Of the principal witnesses. All we know
Is that we are a little early, that
Today has that special, lapidary
Todayness that the sunlight reproduces
Faithfully in casting twig-shadows on blithe
Sidewalks. No previous day would have been like this.
I used to think they were all alike,
That the present always looked the same to everybody
But this confusion drains away as one
Is always cresting into one's present.
Yet the ""poetic,"" straw-colored space
Of the long corridor that leads back to the painting,
Its darkening opposite--is this
Some figment of ""art,"" not to be imagined
As real, let alone special? Hasn't it too its lair
In the present we are always escaping from
And falling back into, as the waterwheel of days
Pursues its uneventful, even serene course?
I think it is trying to say it is today
And we must get out of it even as the public
Is pushing through the museum now so as to
Be out by closing time. You can't live there.
The gray glaze of the past attacks all know-how:
Secrets of wash and finish that took a lifetime
To learn and are reduced to the status of
Black-and-white illustrations in a book where colorplates
Are rare. That is, all time
Reduces to no special time. No one
Alludes to the change; to do so might
Involve calling attention to oneself
Which would augment the dread of not getting out
Before having seen the whole collection
(Except for the sculptures in the basement:
They are where they belong).
Our time gets to be veiled, compromised
By the portrait's will to endure. It hints at
Our own, which we were hoping to keep hidden.
We don't need paintings or
Doggerel written by mature poets when
The explosion is so precise, so fine.
Is there any point even in acknowledging
The existence of all that? Does it
Exist? Certainly the leisure to
Indulge stately pastimes doesn't,
Any more. Today has no margins, the event arrives
Flush with its edges, is of the same substance,
Indistinguishable. ""Play"" is something else;
It exists, in a society specifically
Organized as a demonstration of itself.
There is no other way, and those assholes
Who would confuse everything with their mirror games
Which seem to multiply stakes and possibilities, or
At least confuse issues by means of an investing
Aura that would corrode the architecture
Of the whole in a haze of suppressed mockery,
Are beside the point. They are out of the game,
Which doesn't exist until they are out of it.
It seems like a very hostile universe
But as the principle of each individual thing is
Hostile to, exists at the expense of all the others
As philosophers have often pointed out, at least
This thing, the mute, undivided present,
Has the justification of logic, which
In this instance isn't a bad thing
Or wouldn't be, if the way of telling
Didn't somehow intrude, twisting the end result
Into a caricature of itself. This always
Happens, as in the game where
A whispered phrase passed around the room
Ends up as something completely different.
It is the principle that makes works of art so unlike
What the artist intended. Often he finds
He has omitted the thing he started out to say
In the first place. Seduced by flowers,
Explicit pleasures, he blames himself (though
Secretly satisfied with the result), imagining
He had a say in the matter and exercised
An option of which he was hardly conscious,
Unaware that necessity circumvents such resolutions.
So as to create something new
For itself, that there is no other way,
That the history of creation proceeds according to
Stringent laws, and that things
Do get done in this way, but never the things
We set out to accomplish and wanted so desperately
To see come into being. Parmigianino
Must have realized this as he worked at his
Life-obstructing task. One is forced to read
The perfectly plausible accomplishment of a purpose
Into the smooth, perhaps even bland (but so
Enigmatic) finish. Is there anything
To be serious about beyond this otherness
That gets included in the most ordinary
Forms of daily activity, changing everything
Slightly and profoundly, and tearing the matter
Of creation, any creation, not just artistic creation
Out of our hands, to install it on some monstrous, near
Peak, too close to ignore, too far
For one to intervene? This otherness, this
""Not-being-us"" is all there is to look at
In the mirror, though no one can say
How it came to be this way. A ship
Flying unknown colors has entered the harbor.
You are allowing extraneous matters
To break up your day, cloud the focus
Of the crystal ball. Its scene drifts away
Like vapor scattered on the wind. The fertile
Thought-associations that until now came
So easily, appear no more, or rarely. Their
Colorings are less intense, washed out
By autumn rains and winds, spoiled, muddied,
Given back to you because they are worthless.
Yet we are such creatures of habit that their
Implications are still around en permanence, confusing
Issues. To be serious only about sex
Is perhaps one way, but the sands are hissing
As they approach the beginning of the big slide
Into what happened. This past
Is now here: the painter's
Reflected face, in which we linger, receiving
Dreams and inspirations on an unassigned
Frequency, but the hues have turned metallic,
The curves and edges are not so rich. Each person
Has one big theory to explain the universe
But it doesn't tell the whole story
And in the end it is what is outside him
That matters, to him and especially to us
Who have been given no help whatever
In decoding our own man-size quotient and must rely
On second-hand knowledge. Yet I know
That no one else's taste is going to be
Any help, and might as well be ignored.
Once it seemed so perfect--gloss on the fine
Freckled skin, lips moistened as though about to part
Releasing speech, and the familiar look
Of clothes and furniture that one forgets.
This could have been our paradise: exotic
Refuge within an exhausted world, but that wasn't
In the cards, because it couldn't have been
The point. Aping naturalness may be the first step
Toward achieving an inner calm
But it is the first step only, and often
Remains a frozen gesture of welcome etched
On the air materializing behind it,
A convention. And we have really
No time for these, except to use them
For kindling. The sooner they are burnt up
The better for the roles we have to play.
Therefore I beseech you, withdraw that hand,
Offer it no longer as shield or greeting,
The shield of a greeting, Francesco:
There is room for one bullet in the chamber:
Our looking through the wrong end
Of the telescope as you fall back at a speed
Faster than that of light to flatten ultimately
Among the features of the room, an invitation
Never mailed, the ""it was all a dream""
Syndrome, though the ""all"" tells tersely
Enough how it wasn't. Its existence
Was real, though troubled, and the ache
Of this waking dream can never drown out
The diagram still sketched on the wind,
Chosen, meant for me and materialized
In the disguising radiance of my room.
We have seen the city; it is the gibbous
Mirrored eye of an insect. All things happen
On its balcony and are resumed within,
But the action is the cold, syrupy flow
Of a pageant. One feels too confined,
Sifting the April sunlight for clues,
In the mere stillness of the ease of its
Parameter. The hand holds no chalk
And each part of the whole falls off
And cannot know it knew, except
Here and there, in cold pockets
Of remembrance, whispers out of time."
388,Emotion,MirrorPoemsBrokenMirrorPoembyTiffanyGreen,"My reflection stares back from the broken mirror
Distorted pieces staring from shards of broken mirror
Wondering where these false images come from
I’ve lost myself deeply inside this broken mirror
Disillusioned with myself, finally seeing the truth
That hides within shattered images of broken mirror
One thousand eyes blink, with lies behind each one
Cast at me from the remnants of the broken mirror
Crooked smiles endlessly reflecting back in sadness
Captured is the deep despair by this broken mirror
Scattered about the floor inside each silver shard
My self has been captured into this broken mirror"

Who’s the fairest fair of all?
Mirror … mirror on the wall,
Who’s the smartest head of all?
Mirror … mirror on the wall,
Who’s that girl standing tall?
Mirror … mirror on the wall,
Who's to hold me when I fall?
Mirror … mirror on the wall,
Why are you not answering my call?
Oh mirror...
The lines and the scars you do not hide;
My scattered thoughts you would not guide.
Me myself and I; the gap so wide.
Oh mirror; you make me look inside!
You show me a girl against the tide,
By the rules she would not abide.
Within your frame, a caged spirit am I?
By your name, what voice have I?
Oh mirror … can you hear me?
My mirror is deceiving me!
I will show you my smile... will you let me?
A star in my eyes... will you get me?
I will show you a happy face... please let me!
A shelter from myself... please get me!
Mirror … mirror on the wall,
Do not show me her face;
I have killed her and left no trace.
Mirror … mirror on the wall,
She shall never stutter;
With a new voice, words she will utter.
Mirror … mirror on the wall,
Her fear you shall never show;
Fearless she is to know.
Mirror... mirror on the wall,
Do not point at her scars;
It hurts... not her scars.
Oh mirror...
There is no Santa but tell her not;
Dreams are dreams but wake her not.
She will give in... tell her not to.
She will give up... tell her not to.
Cruel mirror...
Why show me a figure so broken?
Why tell me words unspoken?
My mirror...
Every time I look at you
I miss a line in her face.
Every time I come to you
A part of her I erase.
Every time I need you
I abandon her grace.
So my mirror..
Where is the little fat girl that you used to show me?
Where are the frightened eyes that used to look at me?
Is she still hiding her smile with her hand?
Is she still looking for a magic wand?
You loved her not;
You loved me a lot!
Mirror … mirror on the wall,
What have I done?
Mirror … mirror on the wall,
Where has she gone?
Mirror … mirror on the wall,
Which way do I run?
Yes mirror...
How I wish I could give you my back
and never look at you again.
How I wish I could leave you on a rack
and never fall for your tricks again.
Oh mirror... Why can’t you lie?
Why don’t you tell me that I am the fairest fair of all?
Why don’t you tell me that I am the smartest head of all?
Why don’t you let me stand proud and tall?
Will you at least be there when I fall?
Oh … Mirror … mirror on the wall …
Why are you not answering my call?"

what would you see
a face full of anger and hypocrisy
would you study the eyes
with their bridge to the soul
and say there's a person

would the lines tell some story
of trouble you knew
and how you had struggled
to finally pull through
would the features combined
say there's someone who's kind
with benevolent heart
for the rest of mankind."

Whatever was thought or said,

I see she's not happy but
Don't know why, who is she?
I see her here every day,
I think she's lost her way
But no one will venture to
Help because she won't say.
Nobody else sees the tears,
The lying smile hides her fears;
The confusion screaming in
Her head no one else hears.
I leave her then, go to bed,
Lie down and pray in my head,
There's nothing more I can do
Send some help' I said.
He was watching, he knew,
He always knows what to do.
I feel Him say through the night,
'Don't worry, I love you! '

A real smile's on her face."
398,Emotion,MirrorPoemsISeeChileInMyRearviewMirrorPoembyAghaShahidAli,"This dream of water-what does it harbor?
I see Argentina and Paraguay
under a curfew of glass, their colors
breaking, like oil. The night in Uruguay
is black salt. I'm driving toward Utah,
keeping the entire hemisphere in view-
Colombia vermilion, Brazil blue tar,
some countries wiped clean of color: Peru
is titanium white. And always oceans
that hide in mirrors: when beveled edges
arrest tides or this world's destinations
forsake ships. There's Sedona, Nogales
far behind. Once I went through a mirror-
from there too the world, so intact, resembled
only itself. When I returned I tore
the skin off the glass. The sea was unsealed
by dark, and I saw ships sink off the coast
of a wounded republic. Now from a blur
of tanks in Santiago, a white horse
gallops, riderless, chased by drunk soldiers
in a jeep; they're firing into the moon.
And as I keep driving in the desert,
someone is running to catch the last bus, men
hanging on to its sides. And he's missed it.
He is running again; crescents of steel
fall from the sky. And here the rocks
are under fog, the cedars a temple,
Sedona carved by the wind into gods-
each shadow their worshiper. The siren
empties Santiago; he watches
-from a hush of windows-blindfolded men
blurred in gleaming vans. The horse vanishes
into a dream. I'm passing skeletal
figures carved in 700 B.C.
Whoever deciphers these canyon walls
remains forsaken, alone with history,
no harbor for his dream. And what else will
this mirror now reason, filled with water?
I see Peru without rain, Brazil
without forests-and here in Utah a dagger
of sunlight: it's splitting-it's the summer
solstice-the quartz center of a spiral.
Did the Anasazi know the darker
answer also-given now in crystal
by the mirrored continent? The solstice,
but of winter? A beam stabs the window,
diamonds him, a funeral in his eyes.
In the lit stadium of Santiago,
this is the shortest day. He's taken there.
Those about to die are looking at him,
his eyes the ledger of the disappeared.
What will the mirror try now? I'm driving,
still north, always followed by that country,
its floors ice, its citizens so lovesick

399,Emotion,MirrorPoemsMirrorPoembyprasannakumari,"I loved you once, you took me in
With chubby cheeks you made me grin
I love you for you give me back
Without hiding in your sack
Once I found you in  my teens
Made me pretty, all my means
Found you grow me all seasons
Nature filling moons and suns
For some time you missed me there
Then I found me missing here
Dancing I was with my dear
Lust and love, hai! keep me cheer
You made me reflect without mask
All these questions may I ask
Without answer you showed me
Wife and mother I can be
With grey hair I thought wisdom come
Grey hair did not make wise some
Wisdom gained, I found me failed
Oh! Mirror, can you make me resolved
I thought you keep me all absorbed
Without letting time involved
But, I found in you me sold
Once decked with a speck of gold"

sunset sun.
Bedimming light.
New night begun.
Fortell, what new wonders,

A new child born,

What things anew,

New wonders fathomed,
from the life-giving sea?
Hued pink-edged clouds.
Low sunset sun.
Bedim thy light.
Still, you are not done.
Because, for from thy union,
'tis lucid, sure as dawn will be,
that Life blossoms forth,
from your simplicity..."

She put on when it was cold
The pink coat
That was hung up when she was home
The pink coat
That kept her warm
The pink coat
That witnessed her first cut
The pink coat
She wore when she was crying
The pink coat
That knew her plans
The pink coat
That saw what happened
The pink coat
She had on when she walked in front of that truck
The pink coat
That witnessed it all
The pink coat
Had no one to keep warm, now
The pink coat
That wanted to tell everyone the truth about her
Just;
The pink coat"
402,Emotion,PinkPoems7DeadlyPinkRosesPoembyDelilahMiller,"We had this priest come and talk to us on the feast day of St. Joseph and so strangely he mentioned a girl would know the right guy because he'd be willing to sacrifice his dreams for hers and for God's. Not only am I not a god, requiring sacrifice, but my dreams so often don't follow the path I imagine God would dream of. I suppose, at one point, it's Him or me.
Seven deadly pink roses waiting on my windowsill;
terrorized in their muted fuchsia,
fiery spirit festering and still
creeping slow
on towards
searing,
greedy,
hot red.
As if drinking, in the darkness
of lower light and conscious
my sleeping breaths
morphed you into
a grand prophet
but I am not
goddess,
gold idol.
Are you looking for your god here?
I am mud and a whisper of light;
without sight and rich with fear.
Searching for cosmic love,
you kiss ornate images of
starlight down dripping
from heaven's favor
into my bored eyes."

Like the way it did on a summer day,
Cold as it was, dark as it can be,
I will not fear a thing cause your with me.
I hope to see the sky tonight,
When the moon and the stars are bright.
I'll lay my soul and mind at ease,
With thoughts of you my heart's at peace.
I've prayed that tomorrow, I will see you,
When you finally have your dreams come true,
When sorrows and tears are only yesterday,
And the pink moon grandly rising up in May.
I wished to be a wind, to fly you away,
Yet there's nothing I can do, If you want to stay,
You may not understand just how I feel,
But I want you to know that I am real."
405,Emotion,PinkPoemsPinkCadillacInTheCountryPoembyMarilynLott,"He was lookin’ kinda cool
Against his ‘pink Cadillac’
Looking on ahead of him
But still always looking back
On a red dirt country road
He took a little cruise
Windows open and breathing in
Fresh air that always renews
Route 66 was the perfect place to drive
Across a farm with a brick-red barn
Wheat fields waving in the breeze
A world with so much charm
Old gas station from back in the day
That always makes you smile
Keep right on a’driving though
On that red road for awhile
Windmills dot the countryside
They complete that country air
Listening to country music
Ah yes, nothing can compare
So you take a country boy like John
Give him a Pink Cadillac
And he’ll look straight on ahead
But still continues to look back!"
406,Emotion,PinkPoemsYourPinkCloudPoembyMarilynLott,"There was an old saying a long time ago
When your life was at a place
That was absolutely perfect
No unhappiness could you trace
Perhaps you had fallen madly in love
For the very first time
Your search was now over
No one else would you find
But you were on a pink cloud
Be cautious you were told
This was uncertain happiness
The kind you never will hold
And then, guess what happened
My poor unsuspecting friend
It was like a swift river
That flowed ‘round the bend
Your pink cloud grew very thin
Your ears were ringing so loud
And like a bubble that burst
You fell off your pink cloud!"

In pink satin
A schoolgirl grown
Now gone
Her hair of blonde
Time twirled with gray
She slips away
As did our days
Of dance and sash
Pink satin flash
My memory stepped
In sepia stories
Shared in a vessel
JUST US
A ship of fools
Tied to the dock
Of yesterday's dreams
Watching sunsets
We'd never recapture
Believing then, we'd live forever
In the disco music melodies
We hummed in perfect harmony
And making waves where ever
We thought to cast our lines
Out of sight, yes
Out of mind, no
We flip through the dog-earred
Photo album pages
To find our young tanned faces
Without the wrinkles of worry
In the gaity of gravity
Still On our side
The details colors that painted
Our mural of friends
Ever slightly now fades pale
Pink satin."

It was our address, that was what I'd seen

I read the note that was attached
in it read a message of friendship, love and hope.
'I hope you 're feeling better dear friend.'

I told the delivery man
That there must be some mistake.
For my name is not, Mrs.Irene

Pink blouses, never failing to arouse spouses
Pink hot feverish lips
Passionate pants of pink
Love letters dipped in pink ink

Pink is my colour
Pink is the sweet side of wild
Quite mild
Like a little lost baby child
Of all the colours compiled
Pink is romantic and disarming
All pink roses are ever so charming
Pink is my colour
The fruit juices I drink
Are always colour pink
With favourable odours
Igniting my fire making me desire more and more
Think! Think! Pink always links
With erotic pleasant stinks
Those flirty winks
Combining  with pink
Creating an effect of kink, kink, kinky!

And the colour of my door
Pink is my colour
And the only colour I adore

Pink is a color so mighty, so great
Pink is the color my face
Turns when I'm late
Pink is the color which nothing can replace
It's the color which I can't stop thinking of
Neither day nor night
Pink symbolizes my love
Pink is the color of the light
Which shines in my heart for you
It's the color of a wonderland

Pink is the color which gives me signs"

415,Emotion,PinkPoemsTheEmoInPinkPoembyKateFuelleman,"The emo in pink
She tries to hide
How she really feels
The guy she loves
Won't give her a chance
She feels crushed
Sad, alone, angry
She wants to cry
She wants to know why
She can't have a chance
A single chance
To love him
To be with him
To hold him
To be loved
To be held
The emo in pink
Is misunderstood
Nobody understands
Why she cries
In a corner
Away from the world
He approaches her
To find out
She refuses to tell him
He won't understand
That she wants to be more than his friend
'I can't say'
Is her answer
He looks at her with a puzzled look
'Why not? '
She cried more
'You won't understand'
'I won't if you don't say'
She took a deep breath
And told him straight out
'I love you
But you won't give me a chance
I want to be more than friends'
He finally said
'I do like you
But only as a friend'
He walked away
His words ran through her head
The rest of the day
The emo in pink
Couldn't take it anymore
She knew he'd find another girl
Before he gave her a chance
So she figured she'd save him the trouble
And be away from him
He won't have to hear her say
'I love you' or
'I want to be more than friends'
He wouldn't care
If he ever heard her again
And she'd save herself the trouble
And forever end her suffering
She saw a blade
Nobody to stop her
The blade close to her wrist
She couldn't do it...
She was too scared
She needed a new plan
So she took a walk
To figure it out
It was dark
Too dark for anyone to see
Too dark to see the bright pink she wore
She was crossing the street
And a car came out of nowhere
Didn't see her
Until it was too late
She was dead
She got her wish
She no longer suffered
He found out
And screamed 'WHY?
How could this happen?
I never told her
How I really feel
I said I only wanted to be friends
But was too scared to say
I loved her
I really loved her
I wish i told her the truth'
He saw a knife in his reach
He glanced at it
Picked it up
Whispered the words
'I love you'
And bled to his death
He was found later
With a note beside him
It said
'I regret telling her
Telling her that I'd rather be friends
In case I don't see her in heaven
I wrote this note
Just to say
I love you'"

That bloom in chilly August on it's dark green mother tree
So bright and fresh and pretty in the wintery wind and rain
That's how you've always looked to me and that's how you will remain.
The beautiful camellia flower that blooms fresh and young today
In two or three weeks if that long will have gone into decay
For flowers have such a brief span they quickly fade away
But in sixty years of living your beauty with you stay.
I feel privileged and grateful for to have you as a friend
And I will love you and respect you until my life will end
You are warm and kind hearted and well loved and well known
And it's due to you and to you only that into a better person I have grown.
You are wise and quite intelligent and beautiful to behold
And you don't have a gray hair on your head and you never will grow old
And on your sixtieth birthday you still look beautiful to me
Like the young and pretty pink flower on the green camellia tree."

418,Emotion,PinkPoemsTheHotPinkShoesPoembyPattiMasterman,"I was always late to the banquet,
Or the fabled buffet ran out of food too soon.
The bridesmaid shoes dyed hot pink,
To match the dresses perfectly, pinched my feet;
Mine were three or four sizes too small.
But I had to wear them anyway because time,
You see, was running out; and where else, do you think
You would find that exotic shade of hot pink?
The wedding seemed to go on for hours;
And I had to stand still, in the front of the church, smiling
As the shoes devoured first my feet and then my ankles-
The cramping rose to a crescendo and never became less.
Later, removing the offensive shoes forever,
I knew that I would have no fancy wedding,
With specially dyed shoes, to torture another girl-
Because the clock would be ticking,
And where could you get that exact hue?
They never knew about my secret pain,
And the much-vaunted marriage dissolved all too soon.
But my feet miraculously remained unscarred,
They showed no marks from the crippling effects of the shoes.
It's strange how unbearable pain can leave no outward sign-
Except in memory- where it will always remain
That exquisite color, that is found nowhere else."
419,Emotion,PinkPoemsThePinkVelvetDoorPoembyCandiceJames,"The rain drizzles down,
Soft and sun-kissed
Falling lazily through a sacrosanct sunbeam
In a hazy opalescent mist,
A tarnished key, a pink velvet door
Unsullied and untouched by time.
There is no past, no present, no future.
There is only this moment,
This ever present, yet ever elusive now.
I step onto a wave of plush ivory carpet
Cresting and ebbing under my feet.
Alive with sunsets, moonbeams,
Stardust and dreams.
Over in the corner,
A piano whispers,
A ghostly movement catches my eye.
Suddenly,
The pungent scent of Tabu perfume;
The scent of a woman;
The scent of my mother.
The aroma and texture of childhood days;
The smiles and tears,
Played on piano strings,
Wrapped in angel wings,
Still live and breathe
In the eternal now.
The pink velvet door;
The pink velvet room;
This is what dreams may come.

A seagull churns its wings,
avoiding sunlight,
the hard flight of Icarus.
Pink swimsuits blown in the wind,
in search of due course.
Time is needy, a bronzed babe walks by, a regular
statue of Liberty, her flesh turning to
green palor as the water cools.
In this empty beach dream of deepening sky,
the wet Kremlin and White House
are eroded as our childless hopes.
An old woman collects
seashells-caverns of poverty
to be sold to our deaf ears.
The ocean roars of stolen property."
422,Emotion,PinkPoemsPinkDominoesPoembyRudyardKipling,"""They are fools who kiss and tell"" --
Wisely has the poet sung.
Man may hold all sorts of posts
If he'll only hold his tongue.
Jenny and Me were engaged, you see,
On the eve of the Fancy Ball;
So a kiss or two was nothing to you
Or any one else at all.
Menny would go in a domino --
Pretty and pink but warm;
While I attended, clad in a splendid
Austrian uniform.
Now we had arranged, through notes exchanged
Early that afternoon,
At Number Four to waltz no more,
But to sit in the dusk and spoon.
I wish you to see that Jenny and Me
Had barely exchanged our troth;
So a kiss or two was strictly due
By, from, and between us both.
When Three was over, an eager lover,
I fled to the gloom outside;
And a Domino came out also
Whom I took for my future bride.
That is to say, in a casual way,
I slipped my arm around her;
With a kiss or two (which is nothing to you),
And ready to kiss I found her.
She turned her head and the name she said
Was certainly not my own;
But ere I could speak, with a smothered shriek
She fled and left me alone.
Then Jenny came, and I saw with shame
She'd doffed her domino;
And I had embraced an alien waist --
But I did not tell her so.
Next morn I knew that there were two
Dominoes pink, and one
Had cloaked the spouse of Sir Julian Vouse,
Our big Political gun.
Sir J. was old, and her hair was gold,
And her eye was a blue cerulean;
And the name she said when she turned her head
Was not in the least like ""Julian."""

Ma'am….your coffee?
One lump or two?
Such an innocent question
uttered hundreds of times
in tea rooms, coffee houses,
restaurants, airplanes.
Today, those words
had the power
to bring her to her knees.
No amount of chamomile
or honey capable
of soothing her pain.
She was drowning
in a sea of sorrow,
fearful of what
tomorrow would bring.
How could she face
this new reflection,
scarred, disfigured?
What would she see
reflecting in his eyes?
He said he would always
love her, no matter what.
He said she would always
be beautiful to him,
but this....this
isn't what crosses your
mind, vowing in
sickness and health.
Each day she'll carry on,
with a stiff upper lip
and pink ribbons in her hair,
stuffing the prosthetic
into her bra, no longer
adorned with sheer lace.
She'll march with an
army of women.
She's grateful to be
among the living,
a survivor as she's
now known.But she misses
her curves, even if sometimes
they sagged.She misses
the tingling of her nipples
when her husband held
her in his arms.She
misses feeling like a woman.
She misses feeling
whole.

One lump or two?

Oh, No Thank You.
No lumps for me.

The wooden boat set sail alone
With little kids and mom and dad
Were jovial all together glad
They sail to see another world
Of trees and bees yet never told
The dolphins there are scarce and rare
They swim and dance, yet not aware
Their days ahead are hard and harsh
As fire and steel began the march
Around their scope of clean, pristine
lagoons and land, all clear and fine
The little boat at central point
Of water world, it lost the joint
With real world of far away
as little kids felt strong dismay
They raised their eyes to dad and mom
Amid the loss where no bees hum
And as the fear began to steer
The dolphins click was near and near"
428,Emotion,PinkPoemsInThePinkPoembySiegfriedSassoon,"So Davies wrote: ' This leaves me in the pink. '
Then scrawled his name: ' Your loving sweetheart Willie '
With crosses for a hug. He'd had a drink
Of rum and tea; and, though the barn was chilly,
For once his blood ram warm; he had pay to spend,
Winter was passing; soon the year would mend.
He couldn't sleep that night. Stiff in the dark
He groaned and thought of Sundays at the farm,
When he'd go out as cheerful as a lark
In his best suit to wander arm-in-arm
With brown-eyed Gwen, and whisper in her ear
The simple, silly things she liked to hear.
And then he thought: to-morrow night we trudge
Up to the trenches, and my boots are rotten.
Five miles of stodgy clay and freezing sludge,
And everything but wretchedness forgotten.
To-night he's in the pink; but soon he'll die.
And still the war goes on; he don't know why."

433,Emotion,PinkPoemsThePinkBriefcasePoembyNancyChambers,"When I was in Junior High
A term for Middle School in a time gone by
My Mother bought me a briefcase of pink
Although I loved it, I was worried what others would think
It gave the kids a reason to poke fun
Carrying a pink briefcase, I was the only one.
So I’d leave home briefcase in hand then hide it under a tree
Because I did not want the kids to make fun of me.
Someone tore off the handle and made me mad
The ruined briefcase made my Mother sad.
Kids still made fun of me anyway
As I walked to school day after day
I was young and weak then
Teenage life was hard without a friend.
Those days were difficult and long
But they built character and made me strong.
A life’s lesson was taught
By the pink briefcase my Mother bought.
I learned to walk in my own shoes
And live my life as I’d choose.
Many years of time have passed.
Is that our grandson’s girlfriend? My husband asked
I can’t tell, they all look and dress the same
The only thing different about them is their name
I can’t distinguish one girl from another.
Too bad she’d never been given a pink briefcase by her Mother!"

Not a good idea feeling like I’m gonna have difficulty falling asleep again tonight, but the coke I need despite the intended sleeping fight
I finish the coke‘t was Ice cold and refreshing
Get into bed to sleep – but the coke energy now is keeping sleep a testing
After 11h00 I am still awake
Suddenly I need something else – pink milkshake – it shouldn’t keep me awake
Where do these cravings stem?
Like a pregnant womans woe’s
For future reference
I will not argue such a womans preference
Get in my car at 11h30 to nearest convenience store (Shell garage)
They don’t sell pink milkshake – I settle for a small coke again
Let’s find another garage – closed – also don’t sell milkshake – what a pain
I know this won’t keep me awake – I don’t like another shake
Back to the hotel now
I read a book– A New Earth – is this my ego or the “I” in me
Do I need this for ego fulfillment or does my body really need this nourishment
Maybe if I continue reading I’ll get the answer
Although I really would like to sleep now
It’s late
I need to be fresh in the morning
I have students hanging on every word I utter
My words to them usually dont'melt like butter
My butter will be very hard and cold if I am not at my best
The faith they have in me will not stand the test
I need to sleep now – try my best
If I try too hard I know I won’t rest
Hopefully by telling my Insomniac tale
My mind won’t wait too long
To sing it’s sleeping song
And Hopefully I’ll be dreaming about drinking my pink milkshake
Satisfying this unfulfilled need while dreaming"
435,Emotion,PinkPoemsThePinkPoembyHenryKing,"Fair one, you did on me bestow
Comparisons too sweet to ow;
And but I found them sent from you
I durst not think they could be true.
But 'tis your uncontrolled power
Goddess-like to produce a flower,
And by your breath, without more seed,
Make that a Pink which was a Weed.
Because I would be loth to miss
So sweet a Metamorphosis,
Upon what stalk soere I grow
Disdain not you sometimes to blow
And cherish by your Virgin eye
What in your frown would droop and die:
So shall my thankful leaf repay
Perfumed wishes every day:
And o're your fortune breathe a spell
Which may his obligation tell,
Who though he nought but air can give
Must ever your (Sweet) creature live."
436,Emotion,PinkPoemsISawInYourEyesPinkPinkRosePoembyRatanBhattacharjee,"When you leave me
I feel wounded, uneasy and yet unshaken
I feel sad, unhappy but never forsaken.
Why this happens
Do you ever know that?
I feel overwhelmed with the sky
With the rainbow  above.
I drank the cup
To the last drop
As I felt unquenchable thirst
Of Love…..
I know you never left me alone.
You remain with me for ever
You ever brightly shone
You can leave me never, never.
We have found each other
Discovered all the sweetness under the sun
After all the enquiry I have  made,
You simply made of it a fun.
Do you at all know?
What  your eyes with tears did  show
My love for you was a sacred vow.
I saw in your eyes
A  pink pink rose
What is its exact colour
Nobody but me knows."
437,Emotion,PinkPoemsTheSkyIsPinkPoembyTaylorNichole,"The sky is pink
The grass is blue
Up is down
And so are you
To run is walk
When left is right
Hop is fly
And black is white
East is west
The sun is green
The walls above
The floor between
The rain goes up
The dirt comes down
Glad is sad
And smile is frown
To hear is speak
To see is smell
Down are clouds
And up are wells
When you are me
And I am you
Nobody knows
Just what to do"
438,Emotion,PinkPoemsTheAstrologerSittingWithThePinkNeckedParrotPoembyBijayKantDubey,"The astrologer a babaji,
An Indian babaji,
Dressed in red or red,
Dhoti and kurta
And a linen towel
On the shoulder
With the palmyra charts,
Stones and herbs,
Sitting under the banyan tree,
Sturdy growth
Of the mighty tree
And its thick branches,
Just by the footpath,
near the court campus
Where the litigants go
Frustrated and finding entangled,
The astrologer lies
Predicting
The past, present and future,
Seeing the forehead,
Guessing about,
Holding the hands,
Telling about the graha-gochara,
The bad and bad times,
The criss-crosses of fate."
439,Emotion,PinkPoemsIShallAlwaysWearPinkPoembyErnestineNorthover,"Petronella the Pig, quickly tried on her wig.
‘What a picture, I look’, she exclaimed, and partook,
of a large glass of wine, which tasted quite divine.
Her friend, Loretta Lamb, who could always dress glam,
was offered a wee taste, but being in no haste,
to drink before lunch, said she’d later sip punch.
With bold make-up and smiles, the two pals in smart styles,
paraded through the day, up and down the walkway,
and caused lots of weird frowns in their rich satin gowns.
‘I shall always wear pink’ Pig said, giving a wink.
And Lamb’s lovely in white, well more cream, not white, quite.
And my hair must be blonde when I meet the beau monde.
With an Oink and a Baa, they both then travelled far.
Famous without a doubt, and the people would shout,
waving madly their hands, far from Pig's home farm lands.
They very soon became bored, for they’d toured and they’d toured.
Now home was enticing, fame’s worth sacrificing.
Bold decisions were made, they’ll forget the brocade.
Back now both are content, accolades were not meant
to be. A pig’s a pig, rosy, cuddly and big,
and a Lamb’s is just cute, in her warm woollen suit."
440,Emotion,PinkPoemsAPinkSkyGoneGreyPoembyMandyLee,"The waves roll back and forth,
crashing. Always crashing.
It crests and then falls,
tumbling down and uprooting the serenity of placement beneath it.
So too do bits of hardened sand and stone get washed away,
exposing the soft clay beneath.
Pounded and damaged, a hurt looking life.
The marmoset turns and blinks; a slow, painstaking blink.
And so, the rain begins."
441,Emotion,PinkPoemsInBubbleGumPinkReadingOldComicsPoembyMaryAngelaDouglas,"to my grandparents
in bubble-gum pink, reading old comics
we sipped our summers slowly while
the zinnias fried in the gardens.
after you are over the school nightmares
when you're being tested on the things you never read
because they weren't in the book-
the months are yours.
in seersucker dresses, white sandals everywhere
reading paperbacks by the score all the way from
Englewood Cliffs in brown paper, string, unwrapped
with a crackling like the crackling of words you
picked yourself from the garden of language.
or the SBS catalogue
and this is more delicious than ice cream:
Neapolitan striped chocolate, vanilla, strawberry
we eat quietly at the retro kitchen table
mushing it all together in a frothy heaven
while our little dog mysteriously does tricks
no one taught her yet hoping for just a slurp
perhaps, a sudden accident where the bowls slip
deliciously down and she wins the cracker jack prize,
you bet!
fresh peaches from Arkansas, like eating the sunrise,
who could describe it?
who wouldn't want a dress in watermelon colours,
cherry vanilla- it's decided.
chiffon maybe, with a beaded top
that shines like suns unnumbered.
it's just sequins, get over it a voice from somewhere said.
we squashed it like a bug.
eating Divinity candy, peaked like snow drifts,
we carry on.
and now we're on the back porch with sparklers
and it's always the fourth of july.
and we wear sundresses
while learning the scales,
on the piano we dust on Saturdays
zealously, with lemon pledge.
and reading the Reader's Digest we'll learn what to
do in emergencies, like, if you're unexpectedly
caught in quicksand
or at summer camps
where we are horrible at canoeing
and so glad to be back home
where the real summer is.
even if, we no longer drink
orange sodas every day from a vending machine
so homesick near the humid cabins.
and there's so much of it, still left!
all golden vanilla, the moon floats over it.
or maybe you muse, it's butter pecan
and it's not melted yet.

valley, it clings to me, lives in me, my pen.
and Waves, that run, i float on, the rose and hand,
and the sun on my face, this rose a tender bud.
I cannot share my forest, only you may know your
face, and rose petals find new lips, alive in silk.
Pink full lips glow red and they flood my scents
with folded secrets, and this nose, this tounge burn.
Orchestras, arrangements, notes that seize a score
of music cleft with bars, and  pink, red and sun shine.
Pink is always, never one to leave you on your own, to
find your way that is your home, out side, and Rush.
Pink words are royal words to some, it is rare, to know
another forum and compromise, this norm, why is to tired.
I am the male, i will wear her pink, it is my crown.
Roses are never found confined, when i can make her proud."

445,Emotion,PinkPoemsbarbarismInPinkCityAgainPoembyDrsubhendukar,"I am really shocked to behold the pink city
Blood when flows near by  the green field
From the ill fatted souls of their mother’s womb
Tear when turns red eyes yet steeped in sorrows
Serial blast such brutal act against humanity
in this maddened world by this mankind
fire when burns the love in men innocent
peace and care when waned by evil insane
should we still  call them homosapiens, perhaps no
unwanted rogues resourced by their own ill design
society still seems wild by the doings of paranoia
yet we call upon justice knocking the door of divine
barbarism still plays  by the laughter of wickedness
slanting across the door of terrorism when befuddled
as when wrought by the minds of ill born dunderheads
can we not classify them in between man and killer giant
still they seem to be more severe and wild by the death
even more dangerous than wild and insane of the jungles
the crown when worn by the heinous world of terrorism
the cruelty has already infiltrated to our blood
yet not the last massacre of trade centre or else where
that has not yet been blotted out from our mind,
still we remember that horrific moments by the death
the process of annihilation when starts
sun may disappear from east or west
man when counts his age by the void in darkness
heart still bleats and blurs  by the hope against hope
and we condemns this domestic terrorism by monsters
God might be feeling pity for those Frankenstein
who never think of their own grave.hanging on their heads
I sill remember the inch cape rock against the storm
Ralf the Rover when embraced the deadly death
I still pray God never allows these heartless worms
to be here again or to grow some where on this earth,
lest the tears may not fall again in the furrows of remorse and sorrows"
446,Emotion,PinkPoemsRedLipsPinkLipsBlackLipsPoembyJamesMcLain,"Red Lips, are one plan
and the fires they light
burn too hot..Pink lips,
cause me too shiver.
When seen through
transparent windows,
and coiled and fresh
like the oyster, they are.
And black lips shake me
too my core,
and say things, that i need
you to hear me say.
Front or back, in between
they all set me up.
And they move me like rain
back and forth.
The tounge brings me down
and your hand brings me up
from my knees.
That privilege of full lips is not
lost on me,
it's a simple matter of my pride."
447,Emotion,PinkPoemsPinkLittleCombPoembyPdishere,"There's this similarity with all the girls,
They want perfection in 2 things to unfurl.
First a set of 32 sparkling pearls
& secondly the ever so important manageable curls.
Being a girl, I noticed my curls dancing all over
Just when I had to meet my boss whose a pushover.
Help my curls...my inner voice called out
In this workspace I dare not shout.
I opened my purse
Let out an inaudible curse.
Hell, where was my pink little hair brush?
Did I have to lose it in this rush?
I decided to beg, borrow or steal
Well stealing a comb didn't seem like a fair deal.
I went around to ask for a comb,
No one lent me one, far and wide I did roam.
The search was going nowhere
I would have to attend the meeting with this messy hair.
Just then my co-worker walked by, she had something to say
I shooed her away in urgency and said tell me whatever at the end of the day.
Walking out of my room, i could feel everyone's stare
I wanted to become invisble or fly away somewhere.
They were glancing my way and laughing
To not-give-a-damn that's what i was faking.
But deep in my heart I was perturbed
Before this importnat meeting i was disturbed.
If only i could find my pink little comb,
Call me obsessed but I can't get over this perfect hair syndrome.
I entered the elevator, and pressed floor no. six
Turning towards the mirror, my tubelight did click.
'Eureka, i found it', the truth came out bare
I saw my pink little comb stuck between my hair.
May be this is what my co-worker was wanting to tell,
May be this was why I got all those stares,
Maybe this was what people were amused at,
After this discovery my pride fell flat!
Pulling out the comb, my cheeks went pink
To this futile chase even my conscience couldn't help but wink.
My pink little comb was no more a mystery
But this stupidity of mine would certainly go down in history.

448,Emotion,PinkPoemsPinkFlowersPoembyAronLelei,"Do not text me or think otherwise
I am just picking flowers from my garden.
Last evening I picked a red rose but
Wow! It proved to be too red for my date
Today I visited the same garden
The only flower I found was a white rose.
Where is my favourite pink rose?
This morning I cycled to the market
Sure, to buy my date a pink rose
But the only roses there were yellow and purple.
Tried to enquire where I could get one
But no one knows where to find.
Went to my flower vendor but nowhere to find
Where will I get my pink rose for my date?
Tomorrow, I'll travel far and wide
Only to get this precious pink flower
And if I succeed, my date will be happy
And my heart will find a solace rest
Amidst the residue of love petals
Just with the pink flower petals.
Where will I get my Pink rose flower?
(Dedicated for my pink flower date)"
449,Emotion,PinkPoemsendOfThesePinkPillsPoembyAlienGirl,"It was hard daddy
Getting off of these pills
I took it out on the cat
He’s hiding under the bed
I took it out on my husband
But that was really no different
I took it out on my body
It hurts most when I'm still
I took it out on the waitress
I'm sorry about that
I took it out on the streets
And the freeway going home
I took it out on the neighbor
He really didn’t deserve it
I took it out on the little girl
Who stared up at me wide eyed and scared
I took it out on my friends
And now I cant seem to find them
I took it out on that dish
Watched it shatter and fall
I took it out on the world
Seeking some sort of revenge
And I took it out on my love
By pushing him away
And now?
You may ask…
Well I’m still here aren’t I?"
450,Emotion,PinkPoemsPinkPoembyMarkHeathcote,"At night I think pink looks depressing…
Like a school girls lumpy blancmange
There is something churlish un-exotic
Unless it's of, the most vibrant - colour.
Pink is a misrepresenting, camouflage—
Pink dressing worn is quite un-erotic
At night I think pink looks gruelling…
And on any given dull day, quite dour
Very much not representing,
Springs first cherry blossom flower."

Who would not die, to scream her oinks all there life,
do you fear, will these simple words,
, requested...now get me arrested...
New clean words, washed free, over and over again.
Do they really, sound quite like the others, in your mind..?
Blush me, I will blush you to death, i live for your blush.
your blush drowns me, in seas of pink, that make you oink.
Did you take all my blush?
Please wait, It for you, will make oceans more."

Hoping for eternal darkness
And an end to they bright shining sun
I’m tearfully dry, embroiled by fear
Trapped inside my tired mind
Cold mountains close in and harshness is here
My sun set, back so many years
Got lost among my tethered roads,
Knowing the way of only not knowing where to go
Into the distance, a pink ribbon of black
I don’t know how it happened but I’m broken
Stretched to the point of no turning back
Ice now over tipped my wings,
The earth approaching fast,
This bird no long swoops and no longer swings
Earth approaching fast,
Spiraling, out of control I lost my grasp,
Earthbound misfit approaching fast
Pink dreams irresistible
That pink ribbon still so black
Pink ribbon black incredible….
I’m pulling back"

455,Emotion,PinkPoemsPinkPoembyLauraCummings,"Feather light wings that float softly through the air tickled by specks of dust.
Bright white light inflamed with pink and laced with gold.
Raising flowers, changing seasons,
singing in high pitched voices that only children can hear.
Little tiny people in little tiny clothes.
Pink, White and Baby Blue,
Only innocent eyes can see.
Pink nail varnish, Pink lipstick, Pink eye shadow, Pink blusher, Pink clothes that reveal too much Pink skin.
Standing on street corners innocent eyes forgotten.
Long ago were the days when fairies were believed in.
Lost memories and lost dreams,
innocence killed, for a life of nightmares and love ripped at the seams."

The sun is setting in late fall afternoon
Cold snap in the air as the leaves swirl about
A welcoming view is the painted pink sky
Streaks of pale blue dotted with white
Have been suddenly brushed with a soft pastel
The beauty is breathtaking, such natural artistry
I am in awe of the painted pink sky
I think of you now, how magnificent it would be
To find ultimate and much needed serenity
Wrapped up in your strong arms in loves sweet embrace
To be held by you under the painted pink sky"
457,Emotion,PinkPoemsPinkPoembyMarkRSlaughter,"A blush of pink:
She'd caught a roving eye -
He gave a wink.
Her smile had played a shy
And quaint florescence;
The siren of pubescence
Drew him in.
She bade him touch her hair,
Suggesting that he dare
To kiss her pulsing lips!
E'er the fool a man, he did:
The drips of blood began to cheer -
And so, another rid:
Tips of fangs are sharp, you know -
Dancing ivory feeds her soul -
See her claim a howl upon a chilling wind!
Slain, he lay across a crimson floor:
She grinned in her repletion.
A blush of pink;
Beneath a glowering sky
Her savoured drink
Was done.

458,Emotion,PinkPoemsThePowerOfPinkPoembySandraMartyres,"A dainty little girl skipped across the park
Dressed in pink from ribbons to shoes
Her Mother followed close behind
Not many people cast a glance at them
All were busy with their own wards
There was however a man in a wheelchair
Who seemed completely fascinated with her
His eyes were focussed on her intently
His attendant did not appear to notice
That a sense of calm had descended on him
There was even a hint of a smile on his troubled face
'Alisha' – he finally shouted to everyone’s surprise
For he had not uttered a word in years
Now he was calling his young daughter long dead
In a fatal accident along with her mother and brother
He, the father managed to survive or just about
For he was crippled and he had lost his speech
But the little girl in pink seemed to have changed that
She reminded him of his very own child and the fact
That she turned around and gave him a big angelic smile
Only convinced him further that there was life after death
That Alisha was reborn in a new family, was a happy thought
Much later he did comment that – it was the power of pink
That changed his life on that fateful day in the park.

460,Emotion,PinkPoems0013PinkWithoutThinkPoembyMichaelShepherd,"My friend the  gardener who manages
to combine romantic or ex-romantic
with realist and fine poet and
loving gardener and teacher
and much else, harmoniously,
points out to me that the pink geranium
swinging gently in its hanging basket
in the late September sun, with
an effusive burst of flowering
which it alternates with exhausted,
barely green recovery and dry stalk,
puts on this display simply (simply!)
to attract insects to accidentally
(accidentally!)    aid it to
propagate its species..
so I, who am nothing to it
except perhaps a passing Samaritan
who gives it water in a thirsty summer
and, perhaps irrelevantly, perhaps
from deeper cause,
received just now a shout
of pure pinkness from it so that
my senses thrilled, passed the message uncommented
to what seemed like my purest being,
am indeed attracted, my nature to that of it,
animal or human I’ll leave others to decide,
and from that vaguest of cosmic relevance
intend to see it through the winter
to the birth of Spring or spring of birth
with what - my gardener friend -
may well be love"
461,Emotion,PinkPoemsStripeMePinkPoembyDavidHarris,"We have to be careful
with whatever we say
as it might happen to us one day.
I knew a fellow once
who had a saying that entered
into every conversation that he made.
He would say quite loudly,
well, stripe me pink.
One day he woke up
and found he was striped pink
but the joker didn’t stop there,
he gave him green and purple spots as well.
He went to his doctor
who was quite mystified
with having a man come into his surgery
with pink stripes and green and purple spots.
He asked what he had been eating,
nothing unusual the fellow replied.
The doctor frowned
feeling there was nothing he could do
told him to go home and rest until it wore off.
The days passed and a month went by
but the stripes and spots remained.
Off he trotted back to see the doctor again
who shook his head saying
there was nothing he could do
as is looks like the stripes and the dots are permanent.
The only suggest I can make
is that you get clothes the very same colour
then no one will ever know
which is the clothes and which is you.
So the next time you utter something ridiculous
be careful what you are saying
as you might end up wearing it
until your dying day.

In the land of morning calm
Azaleas bloom pink
At sunrise with a bright salaam They bloom alone
Around a quiet place
Where men, animals and insects
make little havoc of rat-race Azaleas are no Cosmos flower
Standing by the roadside
Flirting, giggling and cheek-rubbing
Against passersby, so dignified
They only bloom pink
Like maidens' heart, so purified
Breathing free fresh air
In the morning glow, misty-eyed
They drift upon the river
Getting neither wet nor dried Azaleas refuse to be tainted
By evening glow on the west-side
Mellowing into a pink shade
Beneath the sun at eventide"

By being always fit
With full force she can hit

Which determines her race

Only on love plea

From the shoulders like the folds in soft
Rays gleamed like diamonds in gold red
From the below sand white was the skirt
From the sharp of creases into the curves
The dunes of sand had shifted overnight
Like the thin line on the lip the shore had
For the surfing ocean of desires spoken time
The lumination was to the night in contrast
On first fingers like rings of the lady in pink
Mermaid to the one on the rock on the amber
Ambition had restraints but may the beauty
Her hand for the kiss before wine of madness
Her legs like widening clayman’s sculpture
Between the legs succulent petals and butterflies
She had the mounds of ice with tips transparent
An evening with music will she adore the night
Mushrooms and prawns and dances like fish
With smooth flexion will her lips on the chain
She but knows how to love from fairy’s land

An inverted 'V', after a tough day's

a formation of flock, heading to the

With a dark-haired girl
Wearing a yellow skirt revealing
Photographic sensual legs
That would later make me cry
All night in bed still pondering them.
I have so many of these
Intoxicating fantasies,
Massaging her delicate feet
And kissing her toes
With her toenails painted pink.
But then I find myself alone somewhere
On an impoverished street,
And I mostly see old ladies or poor kids
Riding their bikes on weed-infested sidewalks,
And I don’t reject but relish and celebrate the contrast,
It is all the poetry of God’s scattered
Beautiful humanity,
As if you could gather
Every amazing flower petal
On a single flower."

A fight was brewing…
Coach laid down the law…
Everyone drinks their drinks

to prove he was legally female

the young men and Coach…
Coach caught him off balance
in his high heeled shoes
and took him to the door
where he/she went into a crouch
and said he was trained
in the martial arts…
Coach backed him out
on Sunset Boulevard…
Horns honking, people hooting…
Maria grabbed Coach’s arm
And he shook it off
“Don’t ever grab me in a fight.”
Her feelings were hurt…
“Jeez, Maria…he may
Be wearing a dress,
But he’s 260 pounds of pink…
You could get me hurt.”
The ex-marine...'I killed
gooks in Nam, and I'll
kill you...'
Now Maria was pissed,
she didn't tolerate racism...
Stepping in front of Coach
'You ought to be ashamed...'
The tall pink lady backed
down the street yelling obscenities...
A month later in the O.J. trial
Deputies had to clear the
Ex-marine from the courtroom…
Same pigtails and high heels…
Different dress…
Coach “He looks good in green.”"

472,Emotion,PinkPoemsPinkFlowerPoembyPeterSQuinn,"Pink flower is beautiful
Always so much of anything
Playfully and never dull
As it is inside spring
Tenderly moments to bring on
To every summer night
Until its blossom is gone
With beautiful pinkish bright
Pink flower is like you
With all your loving touch
So much to make and do
If you are in love so much
Nothing is all like this
On to the blue light dark
With new spring dawn bliss
Shades of the petal spark
Fragrances in the air
Full of new summer high
Touching blossom everywhere
In the hours going by
Just like a love to come
When love touches heart
Flowering passion blossom
Now in these days will start"

waiting to finally meet you..

I cannot hide my excitement.
thoughts fill my mind, of how the night will turn out...
you knock, once, then enter the room.
everythings still as we take in eachother.
you hold your arms out..
and i walk into your embrace... wrapping my arms around your neck...
you whisper in my mouth i love you my  kay...
i love you too, love....
i smile... as you gently undress me..
i stare into your eyes, offering you no help,
but encouraging more...
you look at me as if to ask 'are you sure? '
i bite my lip and whisper ' whatever you want.'
you gently but eagerly push me back to the bed...
taking care of me..
devouring my love box..
our legs around eachothers neck...
i do the same... tending to your wand...
i'm yours... i whisper... teach me...
i learn the secrets of your life....of your love

Your days are martyred in my trust

In your folly what have you decreed

And what great victory shall you stage

I still await you as you loiter at your ease.

Why do you cover the scratches and wounds that still bleed?
Why long sleeved covered dresses and that fake smile you wield.
Are you afraid of the comments of revealing?
Then why was a little girl went through all that nasty dealings?
All those beautiful relationships, has it gone stale?
Her life was nothing but a fairytale,
Cinderella, Rupunzel and snow white
Why do they leave her side every night?
Did she reveal too much? , I know what you do
You pretend all the hurt inside you
You smile as if it doesn’t hurt,
When all that pain inside you are ready to spurt.
Why are there smeared tearstains at the dawn?
Why can’t there be smiles instead of mourn?
Why are so many questions unanswered?
Why are there melancholies blurted?
Who are they? Woman or witches?
Considering so many gasping stitches!
You should’ve stood up
Should’ve run!
It’s hard to forget
With a lifetime to regret"

Right now I'll sip my lemonade.

One of the Bahamas' best-kept secrets is Harbour Island, a three-mile-long, half-mile-wide speck off the coast of Eleuthera. With 18th-century clapboard houses edged with picket fences, this tiny island looks as if someone shrank Nantucket and plopped it down in the tropics. Cars are forbidden and are replaced by golf carts. Aptly named Pink Sands Beach runs the length of the island, speckled with the perfect blush of flamingo pink. Kids can horseback ride along the shores or don a mask and snorkel to go eyeball-to-eyeball with the tropical fish."
483,Emotion,PinkPoemsPinkPyjamaPartyPoembyStephenKatona,"Now what would you think,
Of a party all pink,
With pink iguanas,
Dressed in pink pyjamas?
Guests as big as an elephant,
Their size quite irrelevant,
As long as they've the right hue,
Just remember dyes are taboo.
Their skin must be real,
To join in our meal.
The frogs can eat slugs,
And all kinds of bugs,
Like the dragon millipede,
Which is dangerous indeed.
Would it be so shocking,
When flamingoes come flocking?
Do you think I'm shallow,
To eat only marshmallow?
We'll set you a place,
If you have a pink face.
'I think, ' said a dolphin called pinky,
'This is all rather stinky.
We may look quite bizarre,
But colour is not who we are.
Our skin is only one part,
Look at others hearts,
And get to know their minds,
Then you'll find,
That it's best to be kind.
Tell everyone alive,
They can just arrive,
With their own sort of jive.
The more different their dance,
The better to enhance.
Teach us something new,
Follow a different avenue.
What might seem strange,
Can help us to change.
A party for all,
Would be a ball.'"

Born as to be yet sweet and mild
With hair that`s softly curled
The world has seen another day
The earth has turned again
The birds have watched you laugh and play
Betwixt the sun and rain
You are the universal child
You, the child of the world
By Mother Nature you are styled
In whom the rest are furled
The world has passed yet slowly by
This earth so turned in vain
For, sorrowing, it saw you cry
And felt your silent pain
You are the universal child
You, the child of the world

Nor fear at you be hurled"

The gardeners have created
Beauty of a rose certainly
Cannot be understated
Reds are bright or a deep color
Yellow the color of the sun
And lavender roses are special
And I find them so much fun
Orange roses are captivating
So many shades of them all
Some roses are bushes
And long-stemmed are very tall
Multi-colored roses so lovely
You just can not get enough
You can cut them for bouquets
For their stems are very tough
The fragrance, oh the fragrance
Is virtually hard to express
Almost a phenomenon
Just part of nature I guess
But the rose most special to me
You’ll find in poetry or prose
And that is my very favorite
Loveliest of all, the pink rose!"

Sing the song of spring
To the colors of garden again

Come like zephyr from the east
In the street of rapture my garment
Be the banner of the lovers who
Stained in blood for the stones
Let not doubt like the old lady
When Farhad gave his life in blood
When in the dropp of my wine

Red with wine is the horizon
From the depth of heart sing love

The monster that mama and aunty smote.
Toyed with the pages of a letter she wrote,
about the time, she but crossed the moat.
Devastated and lonely in a bustling world.
To nether shores that she was hurled.
A rending stream of violating pricks.
A heart less journey through so many nicks.
Handled and mauled by alien hands,
her heart and self, now held by bands.
The grief and anguish of yet to come.
No flames are doused by bottles of rum.
Just as she stood, a woman in her own.
this saga of horror, was at her thrown.
How she hated the pitying looks.
Frantically sought the net and books.
With every passing day, the chances grim.
No more the charmers to pander a whim.
Dragged like mom, to the butchers den.
So broken she spoke of marcescent men.
Lost her spirit and her womanliness.

Oh, I thought that time could conquer, and I thought my heart would harden,
But it sends a sudden lump into my throat,
When I think of what I have been, and the cottage and the garden,
When I wore a pink carnation in my coat.
God forgive you, girl, and bless you! Let no line of mine distress you –
I am sorry for the bitter lines I wrote;
But remember, and think kindly, for we met and married blindly,
When I wore a pink carnation in my coat."

And Duty, Honour, Valour, are the same
Whether they cheer the thundering steps of Fame
Up echoing hills of Alma, or, more blest,
Walk with her in that band where she is least
Thro' smiling plains and cities doing good.
Yet, oh to sing them in their happier day!
Yon glebe is not the hind whose manhood mends
Its rudeness, yet it gains but while he spends,
And mulcts him rude. Even that sinless Lord
Whose feet wan Mary washed, went not His way
Uncoloured by the Galilean field;
And Honour, Duty, Valour, seldom wield
With stainless hand the immedicable sword."

And run my stick along the public railings
And make up for the sobriety of my youth.
I shall go out in my slippers in the rain
And pick flowers in other people's gardens
And learn to spit.
You can wear terrible shirts and grow more fat
And eat three pounds of sausages at a go
Or only bread and pickle for a week
And hoard pens and pencils and beermats and things in boxes.
But now we must have clothes that keep us dry
And pay our rent and not swear in the street
And set a good example for the children.

The cruelty of P. L. Brown—
(He had ten toes as good as mine)
Was known to every one in town,
And, if he never harmed a noun,
He loved to make verbs shriek and whine.
The 'To be' family’s just complaints—
(Brown had ten toes as good as mine)
Made Brown cast off the last restraints:
He smashed the 'Is nots' into 'Ain’ts'
And kicked both mood and tense supine.
Infinitives were Brown’s dislike—
(Brown, as I said, had ten good toes)
And he would pinch and shake and strike
Infinitives, or, with a pike,
Prod them and then laugh at their woes.
At length this Brown more cruel grew—
(Ten toes, all good ones, then had Brown)
And to his woodshed door he drew
A young infinitive and threw
The poor, meek creature roughly down,
And while the poor thing weakly flopped,
Brown (ten good toes he had, the brute!)
Got out his chopping block and dropped
The martyr on it and then propped
His victim firmly with his boot.
He raised his axe! He brandished it!
(Ye gods of grammar, interpose!)
He brought it down full force all fit
The poor infinitive to split—

Should not he split too recklessly."

You do blow up in end

Go ahead and test your fate

514,Emotion,WarningPoemsEarlyWarningPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"Are you not frightened by looking at this picture?
This is not for today but indication for coming future
Have we not deceived our mother earth and brought havoc?
Natural wealth is fast depleting and running out of stock
Tress can show displeasure by looking barren
Ponds can show it by going dry even
But it is very difficult to guess mentality of human being
What a level to lower and disasters to bring?
Nature gives an early warning for any of the consequences
Volcano may make its intent known as it is not by chance
Cyclone sends early warning with prior arrival rain and storms
Human mind acts with connivance and doesn’t even warn
We are facing natural wrath as cycle has completely changed
Sea level is rising fast with alarm and becomes mismanaged
River waters bring untold sufferings and add to the woes
This is how our misery is multiplying and goes
We face the world with two way deception
On one side we make drive for forestation
And on the other side allow for deforestation
Eco balance is thus disturbed and making way for destruction
Green forest land is set on fire
Human greed has expanded to acquire
All forest land for cultivation and use
Leaving behind suicidal notes for us to choose
Time is yet within our hands
We must think fresh change our trend
Nature must be preserved at any cost
Else everything on earth may be lost"
515,Emotion,WarningPoemsRedSkyWarningPoembyDavidLewisPaget,"I saw the cloud in the morning sky
So I turned to go back inside,
And I said to my wife, ‘It’s a shepherd’s dawn,
Or the red sky early warning, torn
By the man with the evil eye.’
The silence hung in a leaden pall
As she turned her face away,
And I said: ‘I’m only the man behind,
I’m not to account for all mankind
Or a cloud at the break of day.’
She looked again and she pulled the blind
And the house was dark and still.
‘I’ve looked my last on the works of man
Through whispered tears on a trembling hand,
Or the cloud beyond the hill.’
So she sat herself where she sits today
By the glow of the ash-wood fire,
But she sees and hears and tells me nought
While the devil inside her can’t be bought,
Or ever be made to tire.
So whenever a cloud in the early dawn
Glows red in the morning sky,
I say to my wife: ‘It’s a shepherd’s dawn,
Or the red sky early warning, torn
By the man with the evil eye.’

516,Emotion,WarningPoemsWarningToChildrenPoembyRobertGraves,"Children, if you dare to think
Of the greatness, rareness, muchness
Fewness of this precious only
Endless world in which you say
You live, you think of things like this:
Blocks of slate enclosing dappled
Red and green, enclosing tawny
Yellow nets, enclosing white
And black acres of dominoes,
Where a neat brown paper parcel
Tempts you to untie the string.
In the parcel a small island,
On the island a large tree,
On the tree a husky fruit.
Strip the husk and pare the rind off:
In the kernel you will see
Blocks of slate enclosed by dappled
Red and green, enclosed by tawny
Yellow nets, enclosed by white
And black acres of dominoes,
Where the same brown paper parcel -
Children, leave the string alone!
For who dares undo the parcel
Finds himself at once inside it,
On the island, in the fruit,
Blocks of slate about his head,
Finds himself enclosed by dappled
Green and red, enclosed by yellow
Tawny nets, enclosed by black
And white acres of dominoes,
With the same brown paper parcel
Still untied upon his knee.
And, if he then should dare to think
Of the fewness, muchness, rareness,
Greatness of this endless only
Precious world in which he says
he lives - he then unties the string."

Late arrivals are lunch.
I'm the biggest, baddest monster

The best tactic when I arrive
Is to drop everything and flee.
A flock of sheep and a herd of swine
Sounds kind of yummy.
Tasty, slow-moving villagers
Bring a smile to my tummy.
Stay on your side of the river,
And everything will be fine.
Dare to enter my magical forest,
And surely you'll be mine."

519,Emotion,WarningPoemsNotMyConcernTissueWarningPoembyivororivorehogg,"The night was dark and damp and cold.
The match girl’s matches still unsold.
The passers by ignored her pleas
what she was selling failed to please.
An orphan child without a home.
By circumstances forced to roam
She earns enough to pay her way
but not today, but not today.
Ill clad in rags and frozen through
her tiny hands and feet are blue.
The freezing rain turns into snow
The match girl has nowhere to go.
Without money, she cannot buy
a night in somewhere warm and dry.
She tries in vain to sell her wares
Without success, nobody cares.
The falling snow was getting deep
and still she had no place to sleep.
Although she tried in vain to find
some shelter from the freezing wind.
This was the night the match girl died.
They found her frozen stiff beside
the local convents well barred door.
The little Sisters of the Poor.
Had not been very sisterly.
Ignored the orphans misery
because they did not choose to see.
Now kindly death has set her free.
No longer needs the charity
which they denied so easily
by pious women who profess
to proffer aid to the helpless.
I do not claim to be guilt free
but I  make no pretence to be
a Little sister of the poor
and let a child freeze at my door.
I am quite sure they will
deny any responsibility
and call her death an accident.
They could nothing to prevent.
I should not judge but feel I must
express my feelings of disgust
That this child was allowed to die
for lack of Christian charity.
Although this happened long ago
There’s very little changed I know.
We’re still prepared to pass them by
and care not if they live or die.
We can pretend they don’t exist
an attitude which will persist
As long as we don’t choose to see
They’re our responsibility.

There was a man in New York City
(His name was George Adolphus Knight)
So soft of heart he wept with pity
To see our language and its plight.
He mourned to see it sorely goaded
With silent letters left and right;
These from his own name he unloaded
And wrote it Georg Adolfus Nit.
Six other men in that same city
Who longed to see a Spelling Heaven
Formed of themselves a strong committee
And asked Georg Nit to make it seven.
He joined the other six with pleasure,
Proud such important men to know,
Agreeing that their first great measure
Should be to shorten the word though.
But G. Adolfus Nit was lazy;
He dilly-dallied every day;
His life was dreamy, slow and hazy,
And indolent in every way.
On Monday morn at nine precisely
The six reformers (Nit not there)
Prepared to simplify though nicely,
And each was eager for his share.
Smith bit the h off short and ate it;
Griggs from the thoug chewed off the g;
Brown snapped off u to masticate it,
And tho alone was left for three.
Delancy’s teeth broke o off quickly;
From th Billings took his t,
And then the h, albeit prickly,
Was shortly swallowed by McGee.
This done, the six lay back in plenty,
Well fed, they picked their teeth and smiled,
And lazy Nit, about 10:20,
Strolled in, as careless as a child.
'Well, boys,' he said, 'where’s the collation?
I’m hungry, let us eat some though.'
'All gone!' they said, and then Starvation,
(Who is not lazy) laid Nit low.
Nit trembled, gasped, and, as the phrase is,
Cashed in his checks, gave up his breath,
And turned his toes up to the daisies—
His laziness had caused his death!

If each reformer wants a taste."

March 30,2012
A Warning to all with Infants and Toddlers
With the recent report of other workers suffering similar physical effects that this reporter is currently experiencing from the chromium which is leaching out of recently purchased reflective clothing from China.  It is recommended that anyone laundering their personal everyday clothes that have been in contact with such reflective clothing, wash them separately, preferably not in an automatic washing machine.  The personal clothing will contain within its fibers chromium particulate, some of the larger ones which are able to be seen when light strikes the particles at the proper angle so that they reflect the light into the viewer's eyes, much like the eye glitter worn by young ladies today.
When washing these polluted clothes in an automatic washing machine many of the particles which are released into the wash water are spun right back into the clothing when the washer drains, not to mention into any other clothes that are being laundered with it.  Even after the contaminated clothes are removed, the washing machine will still contain a percentage of the chrome particles, many far too small to be seen by the naked eye, so that the next load of laundry will also be polluted by such particles.
This reporter thus recommends that because the tolerance levels of infants and toddlers for chrome are so minute as to be best considered as zero micrograms (so small as not to be seen at all even in the largest of machines filled with water) , that one rinse the machine at least more than once, by placing the loading dial to the next larger setting, letting it agitate for a couple of minutes then drain, to assure all pollutants are removed before laundering any infant and toddler clothing.  And that all infant and toddler clothing always be laundered separately and best kept as far from work clothing loads as possible.
It is know that the element chromium can cause dangerous physical and psychological effects when one is exposed to levels beyond the maximum allowable daily limits, whether digested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin. And that these over exposures may not be readily apparent or may take days to become apparent after the fact.

Letting you just push me to my final limit
Like trying to break myself ever free
So that's what it's like for every warning
So there's no-one who can finally even see
Low as you hurt me but that's further debatable, debatable
And that'll be nothing that's ever new
No way of making love due so
Even though it happens as every warning
Letting you just push me to my final limit
Like trying to break myself ever free
So that's what it's like for every warning"
542,Emotion,WarningPoemsWarningPoembyGeethaJayakumar,"On a bright sunny day
With the light wind flowing
A Cutie white cloud of peace
Peeked from the sky to play
With the wind
And that Carried her away
Too far
That landed them in nowheres land
Down is the hill
Top is the bright sun shine falling on
Peak of the hill.
All of a sudden
Darkness gripped her way
And a storm of silence could be heard
She saw that she was surrounded
By black clouds from all sides of rain
Which were ready to pour out angrily on her
It seemed like tiger ready for an attack.
With dagger in hand
To pounce on her to kill.
Meekly stood the cutie cloud
Watching and
Remembered her mothers warning
Not to cross the border line
Which she crossed playfully
All of a sudden
The swirling wind dispersed
Away the black clouds
Surrounding her
And she was given a way
To fly away.
She flew away so fast as she was lighter than air
That leaving all the black clouds at dismay.
She reached reached on her mammas  lap
And cried to her heart full.
Mamma said
Be careful next time
Don't get carried away by the wind!

cool eyes
the birth of my madness
and an innocence demise
you had no right to bring me
into your cruel little world
i was just a little girl
i was just a little girl
didn't anyone hear me f*cking
scream
at night, shattering their selfish
pleasant dreams?
no use was it crying for my mommy
i don't want to hear you're sorry
i don't want to hear you're sorry
bared naked was my
little soul
you took whatever good in me
and raped it whole
no longer a person but this shell
who'd love to watch you burn in hell
love to watch you burn in hell
nothing to stop you from
what you did to me
seething hate for you
from which I'll never be free
I'll never grow up to be someone's blushing bride
no one would've cared if i died
no one would've cared if i died
nowadays still in dreams
you will creep
louder I heard your laughter
when you made me weep
inside i'm still that little girl
trapped in your f*cked up world

I know what I wrote here
isn't the most pleasant of themes
but this is what haunts me
whenever I hear a child scream....
or when I walk by the TV
when the news is on,
it might be a breaking story, but
believe me I know what's going on
Child abuse, in any form, runs
rampant in every country
yet efforts to avoid this horror, in my
opinion, seems rather paltry
God forbid if such a predator,
no matter what you do,
were to target any one of your kids
or anyone else close to you.
I wish I didn't know this
or even that I ever care
I guess it doesn't matter as much
if you can't say you've ever been there
Not here to win any
popularity contests,
or to win the Nobel Prize,
I only wish you to remember this
when you look into a child's eyes
Because if you forsake a child
by ignoring what you hear
it will be the end of human decency
within that child's tears
I'm bearing my soul, naked,
for all the world to see,
if for even only one child from
this fate, would ever be free."

553,Emotion,WarningPoemsSlaughterOfTheInnocentWarningWarningWarningWarningPoembyUdiahwitnesstoYah,"The innocent were slaughtered
So many years ago
In the town of Bethlehem
Slew by an evil foe
Satan tried to keep The Christ
From entering this age
He used a king named Herod
Who acted on his rage
Satan has another plan
To prevent God's elect
From being born to this world
And fighting him direct
Now he uses abortion
To rid earth of God's dear
Problem is, he's far too late
They are already here
So if you think that murder
Of the unborn is just
Or vote for politicians
Who plant them in the dust
You do the same as satan
In forwarding his plan
False promises of power
Blood money in your hand
Only in the case of rape
Abortion is allowed
To remove unwanted seed
Forced on one by the proud
'Let's make laws to legalize
Bring silence to the wise
Use strong drugs to hypnotize
Whom God has given eyes'
Repent before it's too late
No longer are you snowed
For now your eyes are opened
Because you have been told
'But ah! My ballot's secret
No one will ever know'
Too bad, so sad, you may burn
God knows your very soul
Now repent and hang on
God is a Merciful God!

To Satan’s will yet fall
So few believe God’s warning now?
To heed Salvation’s call
Christ’s not in mode He’s long passé
It’s all outdated rules
Continuing the devil’s way
They walk to hell as fools
Yet those, who at life’s crossroads stand
With no one’s help in sight
Whisper for Jesus’ helping hand
And take the road that’s right
Yet most will say, that’s not my way
Religion’s for the weak
It’s not for me to kneel and pray
Though fortune will I seek
Rejecting now the hand of God
Refusing love’s true grace
Oblivious to Heaven’s Rod
They’ll never see God’s face
Instead they’ll see hell’s lake of flame
They’ll feel eternal pain
Where calling out The Saviour’s name
Will always be in vain
Humility the proud must seek
The blind God’s grace to see
The arrogant become now meek
So Christ can set us free
God’s testing iron and hardened steel
Refining silver and gold
Be warned, be wise, learn now to kneel
Before your flesh grows cold"

562,Emotion,WarningPoemsTheSurgeonsWarningPoembyRobertSouthey,"The Doctor whispered to the Nurse
And the Surgeon knew what he said,
And he grew pale at the Doctor's tale
And trembled in his sick bed.
Now fetch me my brethren and fetch them with speed
The Surgeon affrighted said,
The Parson and the Undertaker,
Let them hasten or I shall be dead.
The Parson and the Undertaker
They hastily came complying,
And the Surgeon's Prentices ran up stairs
When they heard that their master was dying.
The Prentices all they entered the room
By one, by two, by three,
With a sly grin came Joseph in,
First of the company.
The Surgeon swore as they enter'd his door,
'Twas fearful his oaths to hear,--
Now send these scoundrels to the Devil,
For God's sake my brethren dear.
He foam'd at the mouth with the rage he felt
And he wrinkled his black eye-brow,
That rascal Joe would be at me I know,
But zounds let him spare me now.
Then out they sent the Prentices,
The fit it left him weak,
He look'd at his brothers with ghastly eyes,
And faintly struggled to speak.
All kinds of carcasses I have cut up,
And the judgment now must be--
But brothers I took care of you,
So pray take care of me!
I have made candles of infants fat
The Sextons have been my slaves,
I have bottled babes unborn, and dried
Hearts and livers from rifled graves.
And my Prentices now will surely come
And carve me bone from bone,
And I who have rifled the dead man's grave
Shall never have rest in my own.
Bury me in lead when I am dead,
My brethren I intreat,
And see the coffin weigh'd I beg
Lest the Plumber should be a cheat.
And let it be solder'd closely down
Strong as strong can be I implore,
And put it in a patent coffin,
That I may rise no more.
If they carry me off in the patent coffin
Their labour will be in vain,
Let the Undertaker see it bought of the maker
Who lives by St. Martin's lane.
And bury me in my brother's church
For that will safer be,
And I implore lock the church door
And pray take care of the key.
And all night long let three stout men
The vestry watch within,
To each man give a gallon of beer
And a keg of Holland's gin;
Powder and ball and blunder-buss
To save me if he can,
And eke five guineas if he shoot
A resurrection man.
And let them watch me for three weeks
My wretched corpse to save,
For then I think that I may stink
Enough to rest in my grave.
The Surgeon laid him down in his bed,
His eyes grew deadly dim,
Short came his breath and the struggle of death
Distorted every limb.
They put him in lead when he was dead
And shrouded up so neat,
And they the leaden coffin weigh
Lest the Plumber should be a cheat.
They had it solder'd closely down
And examined it o'er and o'er,
And they put it in a patent coffin
That he might rise no more.
For to carry him off in a patent coffin
Would they thought be but labour in vain,
So the Undertaker saw it bought of the maker
Who lives by St. Martin's lane.
In his brother's church they buried him
That safer he might be,
They lock'd the door and would not trust
The Sexton with the key.
And three men in the vestry watch
To save him if they can,
And should he come there to shoot they swear
A resurrection man.
And the first night by lanthorn light
Thro' the church-yard as they went,
A guinea of gold the sexton shewed
That Mister Joseph sent.
But conscience was tough, it was not enough
And their honesty never swerved,
And they bade him go with Mister Joe
To the Devil as he deserved.
So all night long by the vestry fire
They quaff'd their gin and ale,
And they did drink as you may think
And told full many a tale.
The second night by lanthorn light
Thro' the church-yard as they went,
He whisper'd anew and shew'd them two
That Mister Joseph sent.
The guineas were bright and attracted their sight
They look'd so heavy and new,
And their fingers itch'd as they were bewitch'd
And they knew not what to do.
But they waver'd not long for conscience was strong
And they thought they might get more,
And they refused the gold, but not
So rudely as before.
So all night long by the vestry fire
They quaff'd their gin and ale,
And they did drink as you may think
And told full many a tale.
The third night as by lanthorn light
Thro' the church-yard they went,
He bade them see and shew'd them three
That Mister Joseph sent.
They look'd askance with eager glance,
The guineas they shone bright,
For the Sexton on the yellow gold
Let fall his lanthorn light.
And he look'd sly with his roguish eye
And gave a well-tim'd wink,
And they could not stand the sound in his hand
For he made the guineas chink.
And conscience late that had such weight,
All in a moment fails,
For well they knew that it was true
A dead man told no tales,
And they gave all their powder and ball
And took the gold so bright,
And they drank their beer and made good cheer,
Till now it was midnight.
Then, tho' the key of the church door
Was left with the Parson his brother,
It opened at the Sexton's touch--
Because he had another.
And in they go with that villain Joe
To fetch the body by night,
And all the church look'd dismally
By his dark lanthorn light.
They laid the pick-axe to the stones
And they moved them soon asunder.
They shovell'd away the hard-prest clay
And came to the coffin under.
They burst the patent coffin first
And they cut thro' the lead,
And they laugh'd aloud when they saw the shroud
Because they had got at the dead.
And they allowed the Sexton the shroud
And they put the coffin back,
And nose and knees they then did squeeze
The Surgeon in a sack.
The watchmen as they past along
Full four yards off could smell,
And a curse bestowed upon the load
So disagreeable.
So they carried the sack a-pick-a-back
And they carv'd him bone from bone,
But what became of the Surgeon's soul
Was never to mortal known."

When in my latter teen years, home
Back from work on a week end night

Why, when the clock ticked ten the local news, kindly display?
‘Parents, where are your children? '
For I did know just where they were
While mother said, 'I'm glad your home! '
Damn this news thing, she'd seen it too…
For there was too many a time myself, I did go roam.
But out here in the old Midwest
They say that we are far behind…
No way, I say! We toke as hell!
It's just not the way of our parental kind set of mind
For they grew up from the old school
That taught things always would happen
During the night when so shady
You would never ever find goin' in daylight's dampen
Missing children, famly' stories
Of how just the old times did go
And her mother once relayed to her
This deep dark family secret, you know
Yea, right!  Mom those are fairy tales.
As I did tune then in to view
The latest from my high school friends
About a new show that you should see too
You see I have heard those stories

But it was not just from my mom you know
She was not there I realize
The first time I heard the words ‘Live,
From New York' show, but I do now
Remember ‘twas from dad's friend who did strive
About a man did picket cross
I overheard early today
How they seen him later near home
He had four flats, a lesson fast, their way!
That's not right, maybe he had to
His children may have needed bread
And never approved of stealing
Or even charity to get them fed
Knowing the unions, how do they say?
'It's my way or the highway' bro
And they say supervisors do?
Who's right, who's wrong?  It's still that way ya know
But there is one from long ago
That no-one here may remember
About when times were very hard
And so deadly the sad done surrender
I have pieced it all together
For I'm one big History nut
You may think I am crazy but,
Maybe someday while near a campfire's hut
I'll relay a story to my own
Of how my family seed was sown
For it seems He never changes
In the way He loves his children
For now I know one they do not
And the hidden secrets all the hills rend
But being the nut I am, I do
Genealogy of them too
And searching those cemeteries
Here's one they may not care for to pay due
How the cholera was here too
And now I even do know it
For I have watched some spooky ones
Of times far past and they still show it
I'd search courthouses for so long
And have found the stones to prove it
How my famly' too, lost one at two
Age of child's wean, more or less, remove it
Just how it spreads, and they all knew
So did Nostradamus and Poe too
The water dummies! Sinners Creek!
Good man's spring! Cholera, Black Plague,
Bubonic Plague!
If you drink water from one town
That it's sewer has polluted
So far downstream, you know it not
But the waste is yet to be diluted.
Babies and old men, give satan away every time!
Maybe God's hand makes us take a stand, as I have solved that one
Now many will claim that they already did
For there are some who've always known it
They may have even kept it freshly repainted
Sometimes there are little clues we miss every day
But when they are revealed this way
It tends to make us wonder
But don't spend all our time looking for clues
Or as the old timers would say
‘Daydreaming doesn't get the work done'
Or did liberal schools make us that way
Oh well, they say; one must eat, so I better go.
Right there; no work, no pay, but the old timers always knew that one!

Of mild enquiring mind,
Who came into this neighbourhood
Its wonders for to find [ … ]
They told him who had put the lid
On Lydney; who the ale
Misspelt in Aylburton. And he
Delighted in the tale.
And still, like little Oliver,
He softly asked for more;
And with the utmost courtesy
Was answered as before.
Until one sleepy summer's eve
He came all unaware
Unto a place called Ruardean,
And asked ‘Who killed the bear?'
The man arose and punched him flat;
Another punched his head,
And when the rest had done with him
Our gentle friend was dead.
The moral of this simple tale
Is plain.  Dear friend, beware!
If you should visit Ruardean
Don't mention any bear.
If you should climb to Yorkley Slad
Pause not to question why
They put a pig upon the wall
To see the band go by.
And if your feet so far should stray
As Dymock, lest some hurt
Befall you, make no mention of
The man without a shirt.
Nine lives have cats, and you but one:
Risk not that gift of God!
It's better to be ignorant
Than dead beneath the sod."

And grand was the moment when Spaniards awoke
Into life and revenge from the conqueror's chain.
Oh, Liberty! let not this spirit have rest,
Till it move, like a breeze, o'er the waves of the west --
Give the light of your look to each sorrowing spot,
Nor, oh, be the Shamrock of Erin forgot
While you add to your garland the Olive of Spain.
If the fame of our fathers, bequeathed with their rights,
Give to country its charm, and to home its delights;
If deceit be a wound, and suspicion a stain,
Then, ye men of Iberia, our cause is the same!
And oh! may his tomb want a tear and a name,
Who would ask for a nobler, a holier death,
Than to turn his last sigh into victory's breath,
For the Shamrock of Erin and the Olive of Spain!
Ye Blakes and O'Donnels, whose fathers resign'd
The green hills of their youth, among strangers to find
That repose which, at home, they had sigh'd for in vain,
Join, join in our hope that the flame, which you light,
May be felt yet in Erin, as calm and as bright,
And forgive even Albion while blushing she draws,
Like a truant, her sword, in the long-slighted cause
Of the Shamrock of Erin and Olive of Spain!
God prosper the cause! -- oh, it cannot but thrive,
While the pulse of one patriot heart is alive,
Its devotion to feel, and its rights to maintain;
Then, how sainted by sorrow its martyrs will die!
The finger of Glory shall point where they lie;
While, far from the footstep of coward or slave,
The young spirit of Freedom shall shelter their grave,
Beneath Shamrocks of Erin and Olives of Spain!"

I don’t believe their lies of course
Although sometimes it makes me sad
I haven’t got a dad you see.
He died a long, long time ago
There’s just my mum my sis and me
That’s why I’m certain that I know.
There has to be a Santa Claus.
On Christmas morning there will be.
Some presents for each of us
in piles beneath the Christmas tree.
I only six but I know this.
That Santa works all through the night
making sure he does not miss.
A chance to bring a child delight.
One day I hope to catch the sight
of Santa Claus all dressed in red.
But mummy makes me go to bed
and she will watch for him instead.
She leaves mince pies and ginger wine.
Then she settles down to wait.
My sister goes to bed at nine.
Mum falls asleep and wakes too late.
He’s been and gone, so have the pies
While mother slept, kind Santa crept
into the house and ate the pies.
He left our presents while we slept.
At least that’s what my mother says.
If I should ask why she cries
On this the happiest of days.
Because I miss him she replies.
I’m not quite sure I understand
the reason for my mummy’s tears
Santa has gone back to Lapland
where has lived for years and years.
I think my older sister knows
A secret that she will not tell
She’s not allowed to suppose.
Because she sometimes cries as well.
But I’m a boy and boys don’t cry
But when they cry it makes me sad
Although I really don’t know why.
I never really knew my Dad.

Poisonous gases and spillage emitted daily from factories and Mills
Receding of Coral reefs due to global warming threat to marine life
The mess created by our own hands, threatening the very existence of human race
Man has woken up is it too late, and still no answers.
Man's threat to nature has dire consequences by Mother nature
With the earths volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and earth slips Mother nature is angered
With the interference from Man with Mother nature, can the world survive?
Global warming and chemicals has taken its toll on Mother Nature, and scarcity of Water.
Can the world be saved against this wanton destruction by Man?
Humanity should band together and curb violence against mother nature
Allow mother nature to recuperate and heal by growing more trees
Respect God's gift of nature without causing further damages
Educate people to save the world from utter destruction
Advise people to use alternate source of energy to bring change to the environment
Energy efficiency could also be obtained by educating people to create awareness
Fossil fuel from gasses should be done away with due to carbon emissions
Let Mother nature take care of waste products by re-using it to grow.
Let all the people of the world band together to heal mother nature for the future generation

but a pinched nerve, in my spine, can make a mess of me.
This week I was doing a routine chore.  I bent to lift a plastic bag.
The result, I believe, was a pinched nerve, which made my body sag.
Well, it didn’t sag immediately; at first it was just a mild twinge,
but within a day my back sagged like.......a door with a broken hinge.
Of course once I felt “that twinge”, I “should have” paused to rest.
Instead I took a walk AND did chores......to give myself a test.
My body failed the test, and I was shown to be a FOOL.
I’d thought the walk would be good for me and all would turn out cool.
After all, I’ve had trouble before......and lived again to play.
But I “SHOULD” have ceased activities.......for the remainder of the day.
Now I’m resting midday, in our bed, watching birds at the feeder,
while my wife does HER chores, plus helps ME.......if I need her.
Luckily I’ve had no shooting pain in my leg as I had some years ago.
I plan to be much better in a few more days.......IF I take it SLOW.
I’ve hardly yelled in pain at all today; already there is improvement,
and, luckily, I can manage to get to toilet (by myself)    to have a bowel movement.

One summer’s day my children (5 & 7)  went fishing with me by a fast moving river.
On the banks grew tall grass, and on the rivers edge were dainty blue flowers
As we stood fishing my daughter came up to me holding a small bunch of flowers.
She asked, what kind of flowers are these?
My son also wanted to know.
I recognized that the flowers were Forget-me-not.
She replied, why are they called Forget-me-not.
So, I told them this story;
There was once a brave and noble knight in shining armor, that loved, very much, a beautiful maiden, he had to go away to war to fight to save the maiden, and her family who lived in a castle.
The knight asked her what do you want me to give you before I go to war.
She said, those pretty blue flowers that grow by the river’s edge.
So the knight said, I will get them for you, my love.
The knight walked to the river’s edge to pick the pretty blue flowers.
He slipped into the river while holding the flowers he picked.
His armor filled with water.
He began to sink deeper and deeper in to the water, while he was sinking, he called out Forget me not, and then he drowned.
The last thing the maiden saw of him was his hand held up holding the flowers.
After hearing this story, my daughter replied, it’s so sad.
I said it is, and I told them to look closely at the petals shaped like little blue tears.
While they were looking deep into the flowers, I said, don’t ever get to close to the water because you could fall in and drown, even the strong knight could not escape being killed by the water. Those petals are his tears, for losing his love and life. Remember the brave and noble knight, and never get to close to the river. Then with a fading echoing voice, I said, forget -me- got, forget- me- not....
I told my children this story to scare them away from the river’s edge so they wouldn’t fall into the water, and drown.
It worked! They never stood or played too close to the river’s edge again."

593,Emotion,WarningPoemsAWarningToLadiesPoembyClarenceMichaelJamesStanislausDennis,"Deah Ladies,
Let me wawn you, theah are feahful taimes to come,
And a mos' ter-ific strugge is at hand;
And we have no taime to speah
If we wish to do ouah sheah
To defend, like Joan of Awk, ouah native land.
Foah a really fraightful monstah is preparing to devouah
All that's uppab-clauss and propah and quaite naice;
And if we should be behaind
In the battle aye shall faind
All ouah priveleges vanish in a traice.
O, it makes me shuddah, ladies, when Ai ventuah to reflect
On the ravages this mongstah contemplates.
He will break up all ouah homes,
And where'er the creatuah roams,
We'll be sundered from ouah lawful Tory mates.
We'll be tawn from ouah poah husbands in a most fe-rocious way,
0, deah ladies, can you realise ouah lot?
For the monstah has his eye
On the Sacred Marriage Tie;
And he'll eat up all the babes we haven't got.
And remembah, deahest ladies, all ouah comfort now depends
On destroying this wild Socialistic beast.
Ouah sassiety diversions
Would be vulgah mob excursions
If we pandered to the monstah in the least.
He is bent on confiscating all the houses, land and wealth
Of ouah husbands, and ouah brothahs, and ouah friends.
He is jealous of his bettahs.
And he calls ouah men-folk sweatahs,
He'll do anything to gain his awful ends.
He's vulgah and unchivalrous this feahful Labah thing.
He is teaching all ouah servants to despise us.
He would drag us to his level,
And he'd send to the - ah - devil
All the luxuries with which his toil supplies us.
He harps upon equality when, as of course you know,
And as all the very naicest people know,
It would simply mean disaster
To imagine ev'ry master
Quaite as ignorant as workers or as 'low.'
0, smaite the Socialistic monstah!  Smaite him hard, mai deahs!
0, gathah up youah skirts and join the fray.
Pray, do not shirk the battle, or, with wailing and with teahs,
You'll regret youah negligence on polling day,
We must teach the vulgah working class their raight position here;
We must keep them in their places; we must faight them without fear,
Or there'll be a bittah wail, mai deahs,
If Socialists prevail, mai deahs,
And all 'raight thinking' people and the 'naicest' disappear."
594,Emotion,WarningPoemsLochielsWarningPoembyThomasCampbell,"Wizard. - Lochiel.
Wizard.
- Lochiel! Lochiel, beware of the day
When the Lowlands shall meet thee in battle array!
For a field of the dead rushes red on my sight,
And the clans of Culloden are scattered in fight:
They rally, they bleed, for their kingdom and crown;
Woe, woe to the riders that trample them down!
Proud Cumberland prances, insulting the slain,
And their hoof-beaten bosoms are trod to the plain.
But hark! through the fast-flashing lightning of war,
What steed to the desert flies frantic and far?
'Tis thine, Oh Glenullin! whose bride shall await,
Like a love-lighted watch-fire, all night at the gate.
A steed comes at morning: no rider is there;
But its bridle is rd with the sign of despair.
Weep, Albin! to death and captivity led!
Oh weep! but thy tears cannot number the dead:
For a merciless sword on Culloden shall wave,
Culloden! that reeks with the blood of the brave.
Lochiel.
- Go, preach to the coward, thou death-telling seer!
Or, if gory Culloden so dreadful appear,
Draw, dotard, around thy old wavering sight!
This mantle, to cover the phantoms of fright.
Wizard.
- Ha! laugh'st thou, Lochiel, my vision to scorn?
Proud bird of the mountain, thy plume shall be torn!
Say, rushed the bold eagle exultingly forth,
From his home, in the dark rolling clouds of the north?
Lo! the death-shot of foemen outspeeding, he rode
Companionless, bearing destruction abroad;
But down let him stoop from his havoc on high!
Ah! home let him speed - for the spoiler is nigh.
Why flames the far summit? Why shoot to the blast
Those embers, like stars from the firmament cast?
'Tis the fire-shower of ruin, all dreadfully driven
From his eyry, that beacons the darkness of heaven.
Oh, crested Lochiel! the peerless in might,
Whose banners arise on the battlement's height,
Heaven's fire is around thee, to blast and to burn;
Return to thy dwelling! all lonely return!
For the blackness of ashes shall mark where it stood,
And a wild mother scream o'er her famishing brood.
Lochiel.
- False wizard, avaunt! I have marshalled my clan:
Their swords are a thousand, their bosoms are one!
They are true to the last of their blood and their breath,
And like reapers descend to the harvest of death.
Then welcome be Cumberland's steed to the shock!
Let him dash his proud foam like a wave on the rock!
But woe to his kindred, and woe to his cause,
When Albin her claymore indignantly draws:
When her bonnetted chieftains to victory crowd,
Clanranald the dauntless, and Moray the proud;
All plaided and plumed in their tartan array -
Wizard.
- Lochiel, Lochiel, beware of the day!
For, dark and despairing, my sight I may seal,
But man cannot cover what God would reveal:
'Tis the sunset of life gives me mystical lore,
And coming events cast their shadow before.
I tell thee, Culloden's dread echoes shall ring
With the bloodhounds, that bark for thy fugitive king.
Lo! annointed by Heaven with the vials of wrath,
Behold; where he flies on his desolate path!
Now, in darkness and billows, he sweeps from my sight:
Rise! rise! ye wild tempests, and cover his flight!
'Tis finished. Their thunders are hushed on the moors;
Culloden is lost, and my country deplores;
But where is the iron-bound prisoner? Where?
For the red eye of battle is shut in despair.
Say, mounts he the ocean-wave, banished, forlorn,
Like a limb from his country cast bleeding and torn?
Ah, no! for a darker departure is near;
The war-drum is muffled, and black is the bier;
His death-bell is tolling; oh! mercy, dispel
Yon sight, that it freezes my spirit to tell!
Life flutters convulsed in his quivering limbs,
And his blood-streaming nostril in agony swims.
Accursed be the fagots that blaze at his feet,
Where his heart shall be thrown, ere it ceases to beat,
With the smoke of its ashes to poison the gale -
Lochiel.
- Down, soothless insulter! I trust not the tale:
Though my perishing ranks should be strewed in their gore,
Like ocean-weeds heaped on the surf-beaten shore,
Lochiel, untainted by flight or by chains,
While the kindling of life in his bosom remains,
Shall victor exult, or in death be laid low,
With his back to the field, and his feet to the foe!
And leaving in battle no blot on his name,
Look proudly to heaven from the death-bed of fame."

598,Emotion,WarningPoemsTheWarningSignalPoembyGangadharannairPulingat,"Where thoughts are about fear
Where stress becomes routine
The anger, lust, revenge
And vices tries to conquer
Human heart complains and asks
Stop stop and make things easy
It depends upon my health
The human heart, its performance
You makes it dangerous to sustain
You makes it feel disturbed
When you opt for foolish struggles
The heart says you are in danger
Hear, the wonderful organ
Highly sensitive to emotions
Keep the emotions less stressful
Where your speed must control
Otherwise heart will call it
To stop the journey itself."
599,Emotion,DarkPoemsTheDarkForestPoembyEdwardThomas,"Dark is the forest and deep, and overhead
Hang stars like seeds of light
In vain, though not since they were sown was bred
Anything more bright.
And evermore mighty multitudes ride
About, nor enter in;
Of the other multitudes that dwell inside
Never yet was one seen.
The forest foxglove is purple, the marguerite
Outside is gold and white,
Nor can those that pluck either blossom greet
The others, day or night."

Yon thrush that serenades me daily
From scented snow of hawthorn bloom
Would not trill out his glee so gaily,
Could he foretell his songful breath
Would sadly soon be stilled in death.
Yon lambs that frolic on the lea
And incarnate the joy of life,
Would scarce disport them could they see
The shadow of the butcher's knife:
Oh Nature, with your loving ruth,
You spare them knowledge of Dark Truth.
To sad humanity alone,
(Creation's triumph ultimate)
The grimness of the grave is known,
The dusty destiny await . . . .
Oh bird and beast, with joy, elance
Effulgently your ingorance!
Oh man, previsioning the hearse,
With fortitude accept your curse!"

603,Emotion,DarkPoemsWhenTheDarkComesDownPoembyLucyMaudMontgomery,"When the dark comes down, oh, the wind is on the sea
With lisping laugh and whimper to the red reef's threnody,
The boats are sailing homeward now across the harbor bar
With many a jest and many a shout from fishing grounds afar.
So furl your sails and take your rest, ye fisher folk so brown,
For task and quest are ended when the dark comes down.
When the dark comes down, oh, the landward valleys fill
Like brimming cups of purple, and on every landward hill
There shines a star of twilight that is watching evermore
The low, dim lighted meadows by the long, dim-lighted shore,
For there, where vagrant daisies weave the grass a silver crown,
The lads and lassies wander when the dark comes down.
When the dark comes down, oh, the children fall asleep,
And mothers in the fisher huts their happy vigils keep;
There's music in the song they sing and music on the sea,
The loving, lingering echoes of the twilight's litany,
For toil has folded hands to dream, and care has ceased to frown,
And every wave's a lyric when the dark comes down."
604,Emotion,DarkPoemsTheDarkOneIsKrishnaPoembyMirabai,"Thick overhead
clouds of the monsoon,
a delight to this feverish heart.
Season of rain,
season of uncontrolled whispers---the Dark One's returning!
O swollen heart,
O sky brimming with moisture---
tongued lightning first
and then thunder,
convulsive spatters of rain
and then wind, chasing the summertime heat.
Mira says: Dark One,
I've waited---
it's time to take my songs
into the street."
605,Emotion,DarkPoemsDarkRosaleenPoembyJamesClarenceMangan,"O MY Dark Rosaleen,
Do not sigh, do not weep!
The priests are on the ocean green,
They march along the deep.
There 's wine from the royal Pope,
Upon the ocean green;
And Spanish ale shall give you hope,
My Dark Rosaleen!
My own Rosaleen!
Shall glad your heart, shall give you hope,
Shall give you health, and help, and hope,
My Dark Rosaleen!
Over hills, and thro' dales,
Have I roam'd for your sake;
All yesterday I sail'd with sails
On river and on lake.
The Erne, at its highest flood,
I dash'd across unseen,
For there was lightning in my blood,
My Dark Rosaleen!
My own Rosaleen!
O, there was lightning in my blood,
Red lightning lighten'd thro' my blood.
My Dark Rosaleen!
All day long, in unrest,
To and fro, do I move.
The very soul within my breast
Is wasted for you, love!
The heart in my bosom faints
To think of you, my Queen,
My life of life, my saint of saints,
My Dark Rosaleen!
My own Rosaleen!
To hear your sweet and sad complaints,
My life, my love, my saint of saints,
My Dark Rosaleen!
Woe and pain, pain and woe,
Are my lot, night and noon,
To see your bright face clouded so,
Like to the mournful moon.
But yet will I rear your throne
Again in golden sheen;
'Tis you shall reign, shall reign alone,
My Dark Rosaleen!
My own Rosaleen!
'Tis you shall have the golden throne,
'Tis you shall reign, and reign alone,
My Dark Rosaleen!
Over dews, over sands,
Will I fly, for your weal:
Your holy delicate white hands
Shall girdle me with steel.
At home, in your emerald bowers,
From morning's dawn till e'en,
You'll pray for me, my flower of flowers,
My Dark Rosaleen!
My fond Rosaleen!
You'll think of me through daylight hours,
My virgin flower, my flower of flowers,
My Dark Rosaleen!
I could scale the blue air,
I could plough the high hills,
O, I could kneel all night in prayer,
To heal your many ills!
And one beamy smile from you
Would float like light between
My toils and me, my own, my true,
My Dark Rosaleen!
My fond Rosaleen!
Would give me life and soul anew,
A second life, a soul anew,
My Dark Rosaleen!
O, the Erne shall run red,
With redundance of blood,
The earth shall rock beneath our tread,
And flames wrap hill and wood,
And gun-peal and slogan-cry
Wake many a glen serene,
Ere you shall fade, ere you shall die,
My Dark Rosaleen!
My own Rosaleen!
The Judgement Hour must first be nigh,
Ere you can fade, ere you can die,
My Dark Rosaleen!"
606,Emotion,DarkPoemsAhYesterdayWasDarkAndDrearPoembyMathildeBlind,"Ah, yesterday was dark and drear,
My heart was deadly sore;
Without thy love it seemed, my Dear,
That I could live no more.
And yet I laugh and sing to-day;
Care or care not for me,
Thou canst not take the love away
With which I worship thee.
And if to-morrow, Dear, I live,
My heart I shall not break:
For still I hold it that to give
Is sweeter than to take."

Its child like fingers clutching our own,
Come and play my game it pleads,
I will never leave you on your own,
I am not like the rest of humanity,
I am not fickle or consumed by worthless greed,
It entices us laughing sweetly in the night,
It chases us through the stars crying when we bleed,
Come and play with me it calls,
It runs on ahead playing a hungry little game,
It giggles in ecstasy as children run to it,
It wraps its arms around them staking its claim,
You are mine now, it tells the children,
You are my own flesh and blood,
Spread my message to the others of your kind,
Tell them it’s a reward for being good,
It claws at our skin, ripping away our flesh,
I like to play this game it laughs gaily,
I have new victims every night,
I birth new children daily,
It spreads its black wings towards the midnight sky,
It causes every murder while its eyes glint like a dying fire spark,
Go my children tell them to run,
Tell them to come and play in the dark…"

See the days here.
And in dark
They play.

Yourself half.

Other half, my dear,

Before you, nothing is to utter."
609,Emotion,DarkPoemsContemplatingDarkAngelsPoembyUriahHamilton,"Your belongings are meager
As you wander loveless streets,
And the sidewalks kill your soul
When you have no place to sleep.
For a young child,
Life should be visionary dreams,
Not drug dens of demise
Where everyman has a predator’s eyes.
Life unravels for everyone in time,
But there should be happiness and joy
Intermingled in-between birth
And the onset of the inevitable obscene,
But some people get cast aside
The moment they leave their mother’s breast."

I have no friends
I have parents but they don't want me
As I stay in the shadows no one to guide me
I want to have a future only for me
So if you think I am crazy let me be
My life is filled with sorrow and anger
No good memories to remember
Life is a wondeful thing brought to you and me
But for me it's a burden that will not be taken
A burden that I will carry from this day forward
My life is really not worth telling
So please let me be
I am a boy with no family
Just a dark life and me
So if you think im crazy let me be
This is my life story
Not for you but for me"

""Why are you so pale today?""
""Because I made him drink of stinging grief
Until he got drunk on it.
How can I forget? He staggered out,
His mouth twisted in agony.
I ran down not touching the bannister
And caught up with him at the gate.
I cried: 'A joke!
That's all it was. If you leave, I'll die.'
He smiled calmly and grimly
And told me: 'Don't stand here in the wind.' """
612,Emotion,DarkPoemsOnTheDarkStillDryWarmWeatherPoembyGilbertWhite,"Th'imprison'd winds slumber within their caves
Fast bound: the fickle vane, emblem of change,
Wavers no more, long-settling to a point.
All nature nodding seems compos'd: thick steams
From land, from flood up-drawn, dimming the day,
""Like a dark ceiling stand:"" slow thro' the air
Gossamer floats, or stretch'd from blade to blade
The wavy net-work whitens all the field.
Push'd by the weightier atmosphere, up springs
The ponderous Mercury, from scale to scale
Mounting, amidst the Torricellian tube.
While high in air, and pois'd upon his wings
Unseen, the soft, enamour'd wood-lark runs
Thro' all his maze of melody; -- the brake
Loud with the black-bird's bolder note resounds.
Sooth'd by the genial warmth, the cawing rook
Anticipates the spring, selects her mate,
Haunts her tall nest-trees, and with sedulous care
Repairs her wicker eyrie, tempest torn.
The plough-man inly smiles to see upturn
His mellow glebe, best pledge of future crop:
With glee the gardener eyes his smoking beds:
E'en pining sickness feels a short relief.
The happy school-boy brings transported forth
His long-forgotten scourge, and giddy gig:
O'er the white paths he whirls the rolling hoop,
Or triumphs in the dusty fields of taw.
Not so the museful sage: -- abroad he walks
Contemplative, if haply he may find
What cause controuls the tempest's rage, or whence
Amidst the savage season winter smiles.
For days, for weeks, prevails the placid calm.
At length some drops prelude a change: the sun
With ray refracted bursts the parting gloom;
When all the chequer'd sky is one bright glare.
Mutters the wind at eve: th' horizon round
With angry aspect scowls: down rush the showers,
And float the delug'd paths, and miry fields."

Were fading, and all wars were done."

What hours, O what black hours we have spent
This night! what sights you, heart, saw; ways you went!
And more must, in yet longer light's delay.
With witness I speak this. But where I say
Hours I mean years, mean life. And my lament
Is cries countless, cries like dead letters sent
To dearest him that lives alas! away.
I am gall, I am heartburn. God's most deep decree
Bitter would have me taste: my taste was me;
Bones built in me, flesh filled, blood brimmed the curse.
Selfyeast of spirit a dull dough sours. I see
The lost are like this, and their scourge to be
As I am mine, their sweating selves; but worse."

Unconscious of their power—
The glance in secret ecstasy
I've treasured many an hour.
If that soft voice, a single word
Has breathed for me to hear,
Like Heaven's entrancing airs, the chord
Resounded on my ear.
And yet, alas! too well I knew
That love—or hope—was vain,
The fountain whence delight I drew
Would end in yielding pain!
My folly and my peace at once
A moment could destroy;
It bade me every wish renounce,
And broke my dream of joy"

Stepped through my shadow

Into the depths where none dare
In the darkness of this night mare
The place where I live with fear in the air
Who would dream to venture there
In this dream of darkness despair
I go there without a living care
With nothing at all I wear
No weight upon me to tare
There's no light to see anything anywhere
Yet I travel there carrying burdens, I'm aware
Though my spirit and soul does that tear
I go there without any beware
A place where nothing is fair
Spiralling down an endless set of stair
On my neck, upright stands my hair
With my mind open wide, all of me I bare
To find that I am torn wide open in my lair
Until I'm nothing but blood on a chair
Until I wake with an open eyed stare…"
622,Emotion,DarkPoemsTheDarkHousePoembyEdwinArlingtonRobinson,"Where a faint light shines alone,
Dwells a Demon I have known.
Most of you had better say
""The Dark House,"" and go your way.
Do not wonder if I stay.
For I know the Demon's eyes
And their lure that never dies.
Banish all your fond alarms,
For I know the foiling charms
Of her eyes and of her arms,
And I know that in one room
Burns a lamp as in a tomb;
And I see the shadow glide,
Back and forth, of one denied
Power to find herself outside.
There he is who was my friend,
Damned, he fancies, to the end--
Vanquished, ever since a door
Closed, he thought, for evermore
On the life that was before.
And the friend who knows him best
Sees him as he sees the rest
Who are striving to be wise
While a Demon's arms and eyes
Hold them as a web would flies.
All the words of all the world,
Aimed together, and then hurled,
Would be stiller in his ears
Than a closing of still shears
On a thread made out of years.
But there lives another sound,
More compelling, more profound;
There's a music, so it seems,
That assuages and redeems,
More than reason, more than dreams.
There's a music yet unheard
By the creature of the word,
Though it matters little more
Than a wave-wash on the shore--
Till a Demon shuts a door.
So, if he be very still
With his Demon, and one will,
Murmurs of it may be blown
To my friend who is alone
In a room that I have known.
After that from everywhere
Singing life will find him there;
And my friend, again outside,
Will be living, having died."

624,Emotion,DarkPoemsMyWheelIsInTheDarkPoembyEmilyDickinson,"10
My wheel is in the dark!
I cannot see a spoke
Yet know its dripping feet
Go round and round.
My foot is on the Tide!
An unfrequented road—
Yet have all roads
A clearing at the end—
Some have resigned the Loom—
Some in the busy tomb
Find quaint employ—
Some with new—stately feet—
Pass royal through the gate—
Flinging the problem back
At you and I!"
625,Emotion,DarkPoemsSenlinHisDarkOriginsPoembyConradPotterAiken,"1
Senlin sits before us, and we see him.
He smokes his pipe before us, and we hear him.
Is he small, with reddish hair,
Does he light his pipe with meditative stare,
And a pointed flame reflected in both eyes?
Is he sad and happy and foolish and wise?
Did no one see him enter the doors of the city,
Looking above him at the roofs and trees and skies?
'I stepped from a cloud', he says, 'as evening fell;
I walked on the sound of a bell;
I ran with winged heels along a gust;
Or is it true that I laughed and sprang from dust? . . .
Has no one, in a great autumnal forest,
When the wind bares the trees,
Heard the sad horn of Senlin slowly blown?
Has no one, on a mountain in the spring,
Heard Senlin sing?
Perhaps I came alone on a snow-white horse,--
Riding alone from the deep-starred night.
Perhaps I came on a ship whose sails were music,--
Sailing from moon or sun on a river of light.'
He lights his pipe with a pointed flame.
'Yet, there were many autumns before I came,
And many springs. And more will come, long after
There is no horn for me, or song, or laughter.
The city dissolves about us, and its walls
Become an ancient forest. There is no sound
Except where an old twig tires and falls;
Or a lizard among the dead leaves crawls;
Or a flutter is heard in darkness along the ground.
Has Senlin become a forest? Do we walk in Senlin?
Is Senlin the wood we walk in, --ourselves,--the world?
Senlin! we cry . . . Senlin! again . . . No answer,
Only soft broken echoes backward whirled . . .
Yet we would say: this is no wood at all,
But a small white room with a lamp upon the wall;
And Senlin, before us, pale, with reddish hair,
Lights his pipe with a meditative stare.
2
Senlin, walking beside us, swings his arms
And turns his head to look at walls and trees.
The wind comes whistling from shrill stars of winter,
The lights are jewels, black roots freeze.
'Did I, then, stretch from the bitter earth like these,
Reaching upward with slow and rigid pain
To seek, in another air, myself again?'
(Immense and solitary in a desert of rocks
Behold a bewildered oak
With white clouds screaming through its leafy brain.)
'Or was I the single ant, or tinier thing,
That crept from the rocks of buried time
And dedicated its holy life to climb
From atom to beetling atom, jagged grain to grain,
Patiently out of the darkness we call sleep
Into a hollow gigantic world of light
Thinking the sky to be its destined shell,
Hoping to fit it well!--'
The city dissolves about us, and its walls
Are mountains of rock cruelly carved by wind.
Sand streams down their wasting sides, sand
Mounts upward slowly about them: foot and hand
We crawl and bleed among them! Is this Senlin?
In the desert of Senlin must we live and die?
We hear the decay of rocks, the crash of boulders,
Snarling of sand on sand. 'Senlin!' we cry.
'Senlin!' again . . . Our shadows revolve in silence
Under the soulless brilliance of blue sky.
Yet we would say: there are no rocks at all,
Nor desert of sand . . . here by a city wall
White lights jewell the evening, black roots freeze,
And Senlin turns his head to look at trees.
3
It is evening, Senlin says, and in the evening,
By a silent shore, by a far distant sea,
White unicorns come gravely down to the water.
In the lilac dusk they come, they are white and stately,
Stars hang over the purple waveless sea;
A sea on which no sail was ever lifted,
Where a human voice was never heard.
The shadows of vague hills are dark on the water,
The silent stars seem silently to sing.
And gravely come white unicorns down to the water,
One by one they come and drink their fill;
And daisies burn like stars on the darkened hill.
It is evening Senlin says, and in the evening
The leaves on the trees, abandoned by the light,
Look to the earth, and whisper, and are still.
The bat with horned wings, tumbling through the darkness,
Breaks the web, and the spider falls to the ground.
The starry dewdrop gathers upon the oakleaf,
Clings to the edge, and falls without a sound.
Do maidens spread their white palms to the starlight
And walk three steps to the east and clearly sing?
Do dewdrops fall like a shower of stars from willows?
Has the small moon a ghostly ring? . . .
White skeletons dance on the moonlit grass,
Singing maidens are buried in deep graves,
The stars hang over a sea like polished glass . . .
And solemnly one by one in the darkness there
Neighing far off on the haunted air
White unicorns come gravely down to the water.
No silver bells are heard. The westering moon
Lights the pale floors of caverns by the sea.
Wet weed hangs on the rock. In shimmering pools
Left on the rocks by the receding sea
Starfish slowly turn their white and brown
Or writhe on the naked rocks and drown.
Do sea-girls haunt these caves--do we hear faint singing?
Do we hear from under the sea a faint bell ringing?
Was that a white hand lifted among the bubbles
And fallen softly back?
No, these shores and caverns are all silent,
Dead in the moonlight; only, far above,
On the smooth contours of these headlands,
White amid the eternal black,
One by one in the moonlight there
Neighing far off on the haunted air
The unicorns come down to the sea.
4
Senlin, walking before us in the sunlight,
Bending his small legs in a peculiar way,
Goes to his work with thoughts of the universe.
His hands are in his pockets, he smokes his pipe,
He is happily conscious of roofs and skies;
And, without turning his head, he turns his eyes
To regard white horses drawing a small white hearse.
The sky is brilliant between the roofs,
The windows flash in the yellow sun,
On the hard pavement ring the hoofs,
The light wheels softly run.
Bright particles of sunlight fall,
Quiver and flash, gyrate and burn,
Honey-like heat flows down the wall,
The white spokes dazzle and turn.
Senlin, walking before us in the sunlight,
Regards the hearse with an introspective eye.
'Is it my childhood there,' he asks,
'Sealed in a hearse and hurrying by?'
He taps his trowel against a stone;
The trowel sings with a silver tone.
'Nevertheless I know this well.
Bury it deep and toll a bell,
Bury it under land or sea,
You cannot bury it save in me.'
It is as if his soul had become a city,
With noisily peopled streets, and through these streets
Senlin himself comes driving a small white hearse . . .
'Senlin!' we cry. He does not turn his head.
But is that Senlin?--Or is this city Senlin,--
Quietly watching the burial of the dead?
Dumbly observing the cortège of its dead?
Yet we would say that all this is but madness:
Around a distant corner trots the hearse.
And Senlin walks before us in the sunlight
Happily conscious of his universe.
5
In the hot noon, in an old and savage garden,
The peach-tree grows. Its cruel and ugly roots
Rend and rifle the silent earth for moisture.
Above, in the blue, hang warm and golden fruits.
Look, how the cancerous roots crack mould and stone!
Earth, if she had a voice, would wail her pain.
Is she the victim, or is the tree the victim?
Delicate blossoms opened in the rain,
Black bees flew among them in the sunlight,
And sacked them ruthlessly; and no a bird
Hangs, sharp-eyed, in the leaves, and pecks the fruit;
And the peach-tree dreams, and does not say a word.
. . . Senlin, tapping his trowel against a stone,
Observes this tree he planted: it is his own.
'You will think it strange,' says Senlin, 'but this tree
Utters profound things in this garden;
And in its silence speaks to me.
I have sensations, when I stand beneath it,
As if its leaves looked at me, and could see;
And those thin leaves, even in windless air,
Seem to be whispering me a choral music,
Insubstantial but debonair.
""Regard,"" they seem to say,
""Our idiot root, which going its brutal way
Has cracked your garden wall!
Ugly, is it not?
A desecration of this place . . .
And yet, without it, could we exist at all?""
Thus, rustling with importance, they seem to me
To make their apology;
Yet, while they apologize,
Ask me a wary question with their eyes.
Yes, it is true their origin is low--
Brutish and dull and cruel . . . and it is true
Their roots have cracked the wall. But do we know
The leaves less cruel--the root less beautiful?
Sometimes it seems as if there grew
In the dull garden of my mind
A tree like this, which, singing with delicate leaves,
Yet cracks the wall with cruel roots and blind.
Sometimes, indeed, it appears to me
That I myself am such a tree . . .'
. . . And as we hear from Senlin these strange words
So, slowly, in the sunlight, he becomes this tree:
And among the pleasant leaves hang sharp-eyed birds
While cruel roots dig downward secretly.
6
Rustling among his odds and ends of knowledge
Suddenly, to his wonder, Senlin finds
How Cleopatra and Senebtisi
Were dug by many hands from ancient tombs.
Cloth after scented cloth the sage unwinds:
Delicious to see our futile modern sunlight
Dance like a harlot among these Dogs and Dooms!
First, the huge pyramid, with rock on rock
Bloodily piled to heaven; and under this
A gilded cavern, bat festooned;
And here in rows on rows, with gods about them,
Cloudily lustrous, dim, the sacred coffins,
Silver starred and crimson mooned.
What holy secret shall we now uncover?
Inside the outer coffin is a second;
Inside the second, smaller, lies a third.
This one is carved, and like a human body;
And painted over with fish and bull and bird.
Here are men walking stiffly in procession,
Blowing horns or lifting spears.
Where do they march to? Where do they come from?
Soft whine of horns is in our ears.
Inside, the third, a fourth . . . and this the artist,--
A priest, perhaps--did most to make resemble
The flesh of her who lies within.
The brown eyes widely stare at the bat-hung ceiling.
The hair is black, The mouth is thin.
Princess! Secret of life! We come to praise you!
The torch is lowered, this coffin too we open,
And the dark air is drunk with musk and myrrh.
Here are the thousand white and scented wrappings,
The gilded mask, and jeweled eyes, of her.
And now the body itself, brown, gaunt, and ugly,
And the hollow scull, in which the brains are withered,
Lie bare before us. Princess, is this all?
Something there was we asked that is not answered.
Soft bats, in rows, hang on the lustered wall.
And all we hear is a whisper sound of music,
Of brass horns dustily raised and briefly blown,
And a cry of grief; and men in a stiff procession
Marching away and softly gone.
7
'And am I then a pyramid?' says Senlin,
'In which are caves and coffins, where lies hidden
Some old and mocking hieroglyph of flesh?
Or am I rather the moonlight, spreading subtly
Above those stones and times?
Or the green blade of grass that bravely grows
Between to massive boulders of black basalt
Year after year, and fades and blows?
Senlin, sitting before us in the lamplight,
Laughs, and lights his pipe. The yellow flame
Minutely flares in his eyes, minutely dwindles.
Does a blade of grass have Senlin for a name?
Yet we would say that we have seen him somewhere,
A tiny spear of green beneath the blue,
Playing his destiny in a sun-warmed crevice
With the gigantic fates of frost and dew.
Does a spider come and spin his gossamer ladder
Rung by silver rung,
Chaining it fast to Senlin? Its faint shadow
Flung, waveringly, where his is flung?
Does a raindrop dazzle starlike down his length
Trying his futile strength?
A snowflake startle him? The stars defeat him?
Through aeons of dusk have birds above him sung?
Time is a wind, says Senlin; time, like music,
Blows over us its mournful beauty, passes,
And leaves behind a shadowy reflection,--
A helpless gesture of mist above the grasses.
8
In cold blue lucid dusk before the sunrise,
One yellow star sings over a peak of snow,
And melts and vanishes in a light like roses.
Through slanting mist, black rocks appear and glow.
The clouds flow downward, slowly as grey glaciers,
Or up to a pale rose-azure pass.
Blue streams tinkle down from snow to boulders,
From boulders to white grass.
Icicles on the pine tree melt
And softly flash in the sun:
In long straight lines the star-drops fall
One by one.
Is a voice heard while the shadows still are long,
Borne slowly down on the sparkling air?
Is a thin bell heard from the peak of silence?
Is someone among the high snows there?
Where the blue stream flows coldly among the meadows
And mist still clings to rock and tree
Senlin walks alone; and from that twilight
Looks darkly up, to see
The calm unmoving peak of snow-white silence,
The rocks aflame with ice, the rose-blue sky . . .
Ghost-like, a cloud descends from twinkling ledges,
To nod before the dwindling sun and die.
'Something there is,' says Senlin, 'in that mountain,
Something forgotten now, that once I knew . . .'
We walk before a sun-tipped peak in silence,
Our shadows descend before us, long and blue."
626,Emotion,DarkPoemsTheDarkAndMePoembyAndrewRose,"Im lost in my own dark little world,
it has four walls,
a window,
& a door,
Its forever 3am and sleep escapes me once more,
Im doomed to lie here,
with only my conscious as comfort,
& the dark as my friend,
Only i know whats said in the dark,
whats done in the dark,
Im left to myself in the dark,
The sandman,
he is no saviour,
for he has not come tonight,
now i must seek the safety of day,

Only hell is alike,
with purgatory for dessert,
I can only hope,
for sweet somnium,
Tonight..."
627,Emotion,DarkPoemsTheDarkHourPoembyWilliamHenryDavies,"And now, when merry winds do blow,
And rain makes trees look fresh,
An overpowering staleness holds
This mortal flesh.
Though well I love to feel the rain,
And be by winds well blown --
The mystery of mortal life
Doth press me down.
And, In this mood, come now what will,
Shine Rainbow, Cuckoo call;
There is no thing in Heaven or Earth
Can lift my soul.
I know not where this state comes from --
No cause for grief I know;
The Earth around is fresh and green,
Flowers near me grow.
I sit between two fair rose trees;
Red roses on my right,
And on my left side roses are
A lovely white.
The little birds are full of joy,
Lambs bleating all the day;
The colt runs after the old mare,
And children play.
And still there comes this dark, dark hour --
Which is not borne of Care;
Into my heart it creeps before
I am aware."
628,Emotion,DarkPoemsLoveInTheDarkPoembyMickLines,"Here in my bedroom deprived of all light
My senses reach out to the blackness of night
How heightened they are… no need to see
The sounds of our home give comfort to me
My wife lies beside me… I Love her so much
My mind reels with passion at the thought of her touch….
She is so angelic in the embrace of her sleep
Her spirit exploring other worlds strange and deep…
The smell of perfume like flowers of spring
Fills me with warmth and contentment within
The sound of her breathing… steady and slow
She feels safe and cosy I’m happy to know..
The taste of her lips still fresh in my mind
The touch of her skin as it pressed against mine….
As she gently drew me…. my passions alight
Into her warm body where our spirits unite
Oh! What a dream has this reality become..
Living and loving.. a couple as one…
The reason I came here to this mortal life..
Is now so apparent
To experience my wife"
629,Emotion,DarkPoemsTheDarkPoembyAldoKraas,"Everything looks different in the dark
Sometimes I imagine that things that are standing still are moving
And they are not; it is only in my mind
The dark sometimes can be frightening
The dark is like a burned paint
The dark must grieve alone for its lost friend
No one around to hear its silence
But the silence so peaceful that tears the heart
I look back as I am walking to see if anyone is following me
But thanks god no one is
Only the sound of my footsteps I hear
The trees in the dark looks strange to me, I only see a dark shadow"

In deep cool shadow
At noon of day.

Sweet to kiss,

Enaisled is!
Thy kiss descending

With a soft tumult
Of thy hair.
O unto the pine-wood
At noon of day
Come with me now,
Sweet love, away."

632,Emotion,DarkPoemsAnotherDarkLadyPoembyEdwinArlingtonRobinson,"Think not, because I wonder where you fled,
That I would lift a pin to see you there;
You may, for me, be prowling anywhere,
So long as you show not your little head:
No dark and evil story of the dead
Would leave you less pernicious or less fair—
Not even Lilith, with her famous hair;
And Lilith was the devil, I have read.
I cannot hate you, for I loved you then.
The woods were golden then. There was a road
Through beeches; and I said their smooth feet showed
Like yours. Truth must have heard me from afar,
For I shall never have to learn again
That yours are cloven as no beech’s are."
633,Emotion,DarkPoemsDarkPoeticMindPoembyUriahHamilton,"This poem bleeds dysfunctional desire,
Blood stains through the dirty streets
Mark the paths we trod,
Urban avenues of despair,
But I was still romantic for you,
Your thin unattractive body
And unwashed stringy blond hair,
Your ghost stare in the headlights’ glare,
Your wish to blend into streetlamps
Of non-existence,
Romantic for your perishing soul
Looking for a ride home from strangers
at 2: 00AM,
Something about drugs and tortured eyes
On a lost waif and her pointless life
Was registering as meaningful
In my dark poetic mind,
You offered me the best sex I could ever have,
But I thought, I better let it slide,
Just let you talk about it,
Not put those skinny bones to the test,
Not be one more creep killing a girl
And getting a disease."
634,Emotion,DarkPoemsDarkWoodDarkWaterPoembySylviaPlath,"This wood burns a dark
Incense. Pale moss drips
In elbow-scarves, beards
From the archaic
Bones of the great trees.
Blue mists move over
A lake thick with fish.
Snails scroll the border
Of the glazed water
With coils of ram's-horn.
Out in the open
Down there the late year
Hammers her rare and
Various metals.
Old pewter roots twist
Up from the jet-backed
Mirror of water
And while the air's clear
Hourglass sifts a
Drift of goldpieces
Bright waterlights are
Sliding their quoits one
After the other
Down boles of the fir."

For the daily wage he press his thumb mark

637,Emotion,DarkPoemsDarkGlassesPoembyRobertWilliamService,"Sweet maiden, why disguise
The beauty of your eyes
With glasses black?
Although I'm well aware
That you are more than fair,
Allure you lack.
For as I stare at you
I ask if brown or blue
Your optics are?
But though I cannot see,
I'm sure that each must be
Bright as a star.
That may be green or grey,
'Tis very hard to say,
Or violet;
The lovelight in their glow
Alas, I'll never know,
To my regret.
In some rhyme-book I've read,
A lady bard has said,
And deemed it true,
Men will not bite the necks
Of sweeties who wear specs,--
Young man, would you?
But though they balk romance,
Columbus took a chance,
And so would I;
Even with orbs unseen
I'd fain make you my queen
And you en-sky.
Alas I see you go,
And I will never know
Your pupils tint;
So o'er a lonely drink
I force myself to think:
Damsel, you squint!"

With every move i make, every step i take
It keeps following me
Lord you know i want to free
Dark clouds, dark clouds, dark clouds
Now as the rain begins to fall, i feel so small
I'm always getting wet with the rain of prejudice
Look there is a mist of discrimation
And the fog of injustice
Dark clouds, dark clouds, dark clouds hanging over my head
Lord you know i want to be free
It's hard to look through the thickness of the clouds
Standing under the dark clouds the sun never shines
As my eyes glist for a brighter tomorrow
My sisters and brothers are filled with sorrow
Dark clouds, dark clouds, dark clouds
Why do they keep following me
Lord you know i want to be free
This cloud kept many of our people down
This cloud has kept us bound
Our head hanging to the ground
A cloud of sorrow and pain
A cloud of loneiness and despair
Wondering does anyone care
Now as i look beyond the horizon with the telescope
Of my mind
It was fantastic what i've found
If you can look beyond your dark cloud, sorrow and pain
You will see a star shining so near, yet it seems so far
Beyond your dark clouds, there is a galaxy of deterination
There is a star of i am somebody and it's shining
For the whole world to see
Let's load up our spaceship of education
Put our satellite into orbit, let's speed on to culture
Proudness
Gravitation of ignorance will never hold me down
There's no time for malfunction in our dreams
For many years our focus was ecliped
Eclipse we were inferior, eclipse we couldn't make it
Couldn't go to the same school
We can see clearly now my sisters and brothers
Let's walk in the light, let's fuel up with knowledge
Independence, awareness
Yes use the telescope of your mind
The satellite of youe soul
The orbit of your heart
To reach that certain star, no matter how near or far"

Deep into the dark night that swells
Scorched by the moonlight gone astray
The wind laments, the devils dwell
The dark blanket of the night enshrouds
A sudden chill, a gust of fog envelops
Sensing a bad omen, together we all crowd
The car sputters, the engine goes bust
The spirits rise from the ashes
Chanting ha ho, ha ho
A searing bolt of lightning lashes
Will there be no dawn tomorrow
The wolves huddle, stalking around our door
We could hear the beats of our heart
Whimpering with fear, crouching on the floor
As they lunge....I wake up with a start."

My first thought was, he lied in every word,
That hoary cripple, with malicious eye
Askance to watch the working of his lie
On mine, and mouth scarce able to afford
Suppression of the glee, that pursed and scored
Its edge, at one more victim gained thereby.
II.
What else should he be set for, with his staff?
What, save to waylay with his lies, ensnare
All travellers who might find him posted there,
And ask the road? I guessed what skull-like laugh
Would break, what crutch 'gin write my epitaph
For pastime in the dusty thoroughfare,
III.
If at his counsel I should turn aside
Into that ominous tract which, all agree,
Hides the Dark Tower. Yet acquiescingly
I did turn as he pointed: neither pride
Nor hope rekindling at the end descried,
So much as gladness that some end might be.
IV.
For, what with my whole world-wide wandering,
What with my search drawn out thro' years, my hope
Dwindled into a ghost not fit to cope
With that obstreperous joy success would bring,
I hardly tried now to rebuke the spring
My heart made, finding failure in its scope.

Seems dead indeed, and feels begin and end

``And the blow falIen no grieving can amend;'')
VI.
While some discuss if near the other graves
Be room enough for this, and when a day
Suits best for carrying the corpse away,
With care about the banners, scarves and staves:
And still the man hears all, and only craves
He may not shame such tender love and stay.
VII.
Thus, I had so long suffered in this quest,
Heard failure prophesied so oft, been writ
So many times among ``The Band''---to wit,
The knights who to the Dark Tower's search addressed
Their steps---that just to fail as they, seemed best,
And all the doubt was now---should I be fit?
VIII.
So, quiet as despair, I turned from him,
That hateful cripple, out of his highway
Into the path he pointed. All the day
Had been a dreary one at best, and dim
Was settling to its close, yet shot one grim
Red leer to see the plain catch its estray.
IX.
For mark! no sooner was I fairly found
Pledged to the plain, after a pace or two,
Than, pausing to throw backward a last view
O'er the safe road, 'twas gone; grey plain all round:
Nothing but plain to the horizon's bound.
I might go on; nought else remained to do.
X.
So, on I went. I think I never saw
Such starved ignoble nature; nothing throve:
For flowers---as well expect a cedar grove!
But cockle, spurge, according to their law
Might propagate their kind, with none to awe,
You'd think; a burr had been a treasure-trove.
XI.
No! penury, inertness and grimace,
In some strange sort, were the land's portion. ``See
``Or shut your eyes,'' said nature peevishly,
``It nothing skills: I cannot help my case:
``'Tis the Last judgment's fire must cure this place,
``Calcine its clods and set my prisoners free.''
XII.
If there pushed any ragged thistle-stalk
Above its mates, the head was chopped; the bents
Were jealous else. What made those holes and rents
In the dock's harsh swarth leaves, bruised as to baulk
All hope of greenness?'tis a brute must walk
Pashing their life out, with a brute's intents.
XIII.
As for the grass, it grew as scant as hair
In leprosy; thin dry blades pricked the mud
Which underneath looked kneaded up with blood.
One stiff blind horse, his every bone a-stare,
Stood stupefied, however he came there:
Thrust out past service from the devil's stud!
XIV.
Alive? he might be dead for aught I know,
With that red gaunt and colloped neck a-strain,
And shut eyes underneath the rusty mane;
Seldom went such grotesqueness with such woe;
I never saw a brute I hated so;
He must be wicked to deserve such pain.
XV.
I shut my eyes and turned them on my heart.
As a man calls for wine before he fights,
I asked one draught of earlier, happier sights,
Ere fitly I could hope to play my part.
Think first, fight afterwards---the soldier's art:
One taste of the old time sets all to rights.
XVI.
Not it! I fancied Cuthbert's reddening face
Beneath its garniture of curly gold,
Dear fellow, till I almost felt him fold
An arm in mine to fix me to the place,
That way he used. Alas, one night's disgrace!
Out went my heart's new fire and left it cold.
XVII.
Giles then, the soul of honour---there he stands
Frank as ten years ago when knighted first.
What honest man should dare (he said) he durst.
Good---but the scene shifts---faugh! what hangman hands
Pin to his breast a parchment? His own bands
Read it. Poor traitor, spit upon and curst!
XVIII.
Better this present than a past like that;
Back therefore to my darkening path again!
No sound, no sight as far as eye could strain.
Will the night send a howlet or a bat?
I asked: when something on the dismal flat
Came to arrest my thoughts and change their train.
XIX.
A sudden little river crossed my path
As unexpected as a serpent comes.
No sluggish tide congenial to the glooms;
This, as it frothed by, might have been a bath
For the fiend's glowing hoof---to see the wrath
Of its black eddy bespate with flakes and spumes.
XX.
So petty yet so spiteful! All along,
Low scrubby alders kneeled down over it;
Drenched willows flung them headlong in a fit
Of route despair, a suicidal throng:
The river which had done them all the wrong,
Whate'er that was, rolled by, deterred no whit.
XXI.
Which, while I forded,---good saints, how I feared
To set my foot upon a dead man's cheek,
Each step, or feel the spear I thrust to seek
For hollows, tangled in his hair or beard!
---It may have been a water-rat I speared,
But, ugh! it sounded like a baby's shriek.
XXII.
Glad was I when I reached the other bank.
Now for a better country. Vain presage!
Who were the strugglers, what war did they wage,
Whose savage trample thus could pad the dank
Soil to a plash? Toads in a poisoned tank,
Or wild cats in a red-hot iron cage---
XXIII.
The fight must so have seemed in that fell cirque.
What penned them there, with all the plain to choose?
No foot-print leading to that horrid mews,
None out of it. Mad brewage set to work
Their brains, no doubt, like galley-slaves the Turk
Pits for his pastime, Christians against Jews.
XXIV.
And more than that---a furlong on---why, there!
What bad use was that engine for, that wheel,
Or brake, not wheel---that harrow fit to reel
Men's bodies out like silk? with all the air
Of Tophet's tool, on earth left unaware,
Or brought to sharpen its rusty teeth of steel.
XXV.
Then came a bit of stubbed ground, once a wood,
Next a marsh, it would seem, and now mere earth
Desperate and done with; (so a fool finds mirth,
Makes a thing and then mars it, till his mood
Changes and off he goes!) within a rood---
Bog, clay and rubble, sand and stark black dearth.
XXVI.
Now blotches rankling, coloured gay and grim,
Now patches where some leanness of the soil's
Broke into moss or substances like boils;
Then came some palsied oak, a cleft in him
Like a distorted mouth that splits its rim
Gaping at death, and dies while it recoils.
XXVII.
And just as far as ever from the end!
Nought in the distance but the evening, nought
To point my footstep further! At the thought,
great black bird, Apollyon's bosom-friend,
Sailed past, nor beat his wide wing dragon-penned
That brushed my cap---perchance the guide I sought.
XXVIII.
For, looking up, aware I somehow grew,
'Spite of the dusk, the plain had given place
All round to mountains---with such name to grace
Mere ugly heights and heaps now stolen in view.
How thus they had surprised me,---solve it, you!
How to get from them was no clearer case.
XXIX.
Yet half I seemed to recognize some trick
Of mischief happened to me, God knows when---
In a bad dream perhaps. Here ended, then,
Progress this way. When, in the very nick
Of giving up, one time more, came a click
As when a trap shuts---you're inside the den!
XXX.
Burningly it came on me all at once,
This was the place! those two hills on the right,
Crouched like two bulls locked horn in horn in fight;
While to the left, a tall scalped mountain ... Dunce,
Dotard, a-dozing at the very nonce,
After a life spent training for the sight!
XXXI.
What in the midst lay but the Tower itself?
The round squat turret, blind as the fool's heart,
Built of brown stone, without a counter-part
In the whole world. The tempest's mocking elf
Points to the shipman thus the unseen shelf
He strikes on, only when the timbers start.
XXXII.
Not see? because of night perhaps?---why, day
Came back again for that! before it left,
The dying sunset kindled through a cleft:
The hills, like giants at a hunting, lay,
Chin upon hand, to see the game at bay,---
``Now stab and end the creature---to the heft!''
XXXIII.
Not hear? when noise was everywhere! it tolled
Increasing like a bell. Names in my ears
Of all the lost adventurers my peers,---
How such a one was strong, and such was bold,
And such was fortunate, yet, each of old
Lost, lost! one moment knelled the woe of years.
XXXIV.
There they stood, ranged along the hill-sides, met
To view the last of me, a living frame
For one more picture! in a sheet of flame
I saw them and I knew them all. And yet
Dauntless the slug-horn to my lips I set,
And blew. ``_Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came._''"
646,Emotion,DarkPoemsDarkDarkDarkPoembyShirleyHanley,"Uneasy darkness envelopes me.
Blinding moments
of mood disorient
this creature of melancholy.
A great saddness
my constant
companion.
My family is
moving away.
They haven't  left yet,
but oh they are going...
yes, they are going,
far away,
far away.
An uneasy foreboding
catches me unawares,
a premonition of tenebrous days ahead...
Questions thrown
to the ether...
Will I see you again?
Will fate take me away
before we can reunite?
A great saddess yes indeed,

647,Emotion,DarkPoemsSittingInTheDarkPoembyJakeGassiot,"I am sitting here in the dark
I am thinking of all the pain
Forgetting all the happiness
I keep thinking that if I do it
Then I wont have to worry anymore
But then I think of why I haven’t done it
My mind searching for the answer
I find it
I haven’t done it because of people
I want to do it because of them
But they are what is keeping me alive
I feel it eating away more and more
Every time I sit here
I feel as if I can’t get out
Of this black hole of pain
I feel the cuts getting deeper
I am sitting here in the dark
Should I pull the trigger"
648,Emotion,DarkPoemsDarkSpringPoembyYvorWinters,"My mother
Foresaw deaths
And walked among
Chrysanthemums,
Winecolored,
Withe red rose,
The earthy blossoms.
My very breath
Disowned
In nights of study,
And page by page
I came on spring.
The rats run on the roof,
These words come hard---
Sadder than cockcrow
In a dreamless, earthen sleep.
The Christ, eternal
In the scented cold; my love,
Her hand on the sill
White, as if out of earth;
And spring, the sleep of the dead."

650,Emotion,DarkPoemsTheDarkCompanionPoembyJamesBruntonStephens,"There is an orb that mocked the lore of sages
Long time with mystery of strange unrest;
The steadfast law that rounds the starry ages
Gave doubtful token of supreme behest.
But they who knew the ways of God unchanging,
Concluded some far influence unseen --
Some kindred sphere through viewless ethers ranging,
Whose strong persuasions spanned the void between.
And knowing it alone through perturbation
And vague disquiet of another star,
They named it, till the day of revelation,
""The Dark Companion"" -- darkly guessed afar.
But when, through new perfection of appliance,
Faith merged at length in undisputed sight,
The mystic mover was revealed to science,
No Dark Companion, but -- a speck of light.
No Dark Companion, but a sun of glory;
No fell disturber, but a bright compeer;
The shining complement that crowned the story;
The golden link that made the meaning clear.
Oh, Dark Companion, journeying ever by us,
Oh, grim Perturber of our works and ways --
Oh, potent Dread, unseen, yet ever nigh us,
Disquieting all the tenor of our days --
Oh, Dark Companion, Death, whose wide embraces
O'ertake remotest change of clime and skies --
Oh, Dark Companion, Death, whose grievous traces
Are scattered shreds of riven enterprise --
Thou, too, in this wise, when, our eyes unsealing,
The clearer day shall change our faith to sight,
Shalt show thyself, in that supreme revealing,
No Dark Companion, but a thing of light.
No ruthless wrecker of harmonious order;
No alien heart of discord and caprice;
A beckoning light upon the Blissful Border;
A kindred element of law and peace.
So, too, our strange unrest in this our dwelling,
The trembling that thou joinest with our mirth,
Are but thy magnet-communings compelling
Our spirits farther from the scope of earth.
So, doubtless, when beneath thy potence swerving,
'Tis that thou lead'st us by a path unknown,
Our seeming deviations all subserving
The perfect orbit round the central throne.
The night wind moans. The Austral wilds are round me.
The loved who live -- ah, God! how few they are!
I looked above; and heaven in mercy found me
This parable of comfort in a star."

652,Emotion,DarkPoemsTheBirdWithTheDarkPlumesPoembyRobinsonJeffers,"The bird with the dark plumes in my blood,
That never for one moment however I patched my truces
Consented to make peace with the people,
It is pitiful now to watch her pleasure In a breath of
tempest
Breaking the sad promise of spring.
Are these that morose hawk's wings, vaulting, a mere
mad swallow's,
The snow-shed peak, the violent precipice?
Poor outlaw that would not value their praise do you
prize their blame?
""Their liking"" she said ""was a long creance,
But let them be kind enough to hate me that opens the
sky.""
It is almost as foolish my poor falcon
To want hatred as to want love; and harder to win.

653,Emotion,DarkPoemsDarkMountainsPoembySandraFowler,"For I have seen dark mountains in the sky,
More Himalayan to the naked eye,
Than any reason for our where or why.
Hands clasp to lift a measure of that height.
The gesture is as fragile as a kite
Against the massive, polarizing night.
And yet, my friend, I am content to be
A little part of that entirety.
All space my hands can hold belongs to me."
654,Emotion,DarkPoemsFromTheDarkTowerPoembyCounteeCullen,"We shall not always plant while others reap
The golden increment of bursting fruit,
Not always countenance, abject and mute,
That lesser men should hold their brothers cheap;
Not everlastingly while others sleep
Shall we beguile their limbs with mellow flute,
Not always bend to some more subtle brute;
We were not made to eternally weep.
The night whose sable breast relieves the stark,
White stars is no less lovely being dark,
And there are buds that cannot bloom at all
In light, but crumple, piteous, and fall;
So in the dark we hide the heart that bleeds,
And wait, and tend our agonizing seeds."
655,Emotion,DarkPoemse3DarkTheDarkNightPoembyRenuRakhejaakaTranquilOcean,"Why is tonight such a dark night
What is it trying to hide?
Sweeping a dark velvet shroud shutting all light
Invoking the restful spirits to rise
Rise, rise, slowly they rise
Mortals like us standing in a hush
The shaman suddenly lets out a cry
His chants gone awry in a sudden rush
They swoop, they circle, they speak without words
A sudden breeze blows, an icy shudder flows
The owl lets out a shriek, so do other birds
The demons in the mortals sneak out in rows
The wolves come out from the men
To join the dance of its hosts
Circling over the body of the shaman
Being feasted by the ghosts
The men stand rooted in a respectful trance
The moon slides in to watch casting its silvery light
To see this orgy of the dark, to see them all dance
As the fog creeps in and then out, they have floated out of sight"
656,Emotion,DarkPoemsInADarkTimePoembyTheodoreRoethke,"In a dark time, the eye begins to see,
I meet my shadow in the deepening shade;
I hear my echo in the echoing wood--
A lord of nature weeping to a tree.
I live between the heron and the wren,
Beasts of the hill and serpents of the den.
What's madness but nobility of soul
At odds with circumstance? The day's on fire!
I know the purity of pure despair,
My shadow pinned against a sweating wall.
That place among the rocks--is it a cave,
Or a winding path? The edge is what I have.
A steady storm of correspondences!
A night flowing with birds, a ragged moon,
And in broad day the midnight come again!
A man goes far to find out what he is--
Death of the self in a long, tearless night,
All natural shapes blazing unnatural light.
Dark, dark my light, and darker my desire.
My soul, like some heat-maddened summer fly,
Keeps buzzing at the sill. Which I is I?
A fallen man, I climb out of my fear.
The mind enters itself, and God the mind,
And one is One, free in the tearing wind."
657,Emotion,DarkPoemsWrittenNearAPortOnADarkEveningPoembyCharlotteSmith,"o
Huge vapours brood above the clifted shore,
Night on the ocean settles dark and mute,
Save where is heard the repercussive roar
Of drowsy billows on the rugged foot
Of rocks remote; or still more distant tone
Of seamen in the anchored bark that tell
The watch relieved; or one deep voice alone
Singing the hour, and bidding ""Strike the bell!""
All is black shadow but the lucid line
Marked by the light surf on the level sand,
Or where afar the ship-lights faintly shine
Like wandering fairy fires, that oft on land
Misled the pilgrim--such the dubious ray
That wavering reason lends in life's long darkling way.

658,Emotion,DarkPoemsLurkingInTheDarkPoembyGaryMcPhail,"From the shadows his hand took a hold of my wrist,
I panicked and struggled to escape his tight grip,
I heard his footsteps creep behind mine
the sweat dripped and tears filled my eyes,
I ran
until reaching an empty road dead as the night,
It scared me the most.
I didn't look behind
he may be ready to attack at any time,
I regained my courage and turned to see if he would show,
His where abouts I did not know,
There I was
Standing alone,
Surrounded by mist and the trees that spoke,
The sun started to fall
my heart beat began to rise,
As once again
I felt his hand touch mine."
659,Emotion,DarkPoemsWingsOfDarkPoembyBernardShaw,"Wings of dark evenly spread,
Flatter slowly around my head.
Everything is deepening gloom
A Foreboding of my very doom.
Falling deeper every day,
Unable to see my weary way.
Sinking slowly into the mires,
No warmth from earthly fires.
No hope as darkness takes it hold,
Squeezed into this my depressive mould.
I see no light in this perpetual dark,
Utter sadness has cancelled my human spark.
Please put an end to this bitter struggle,
I can no longer with life's hopes juggle,
Leave me to my self-pity and despair.
A ghost of myself I am no longer there."

662,Emotion,DarkPoemsTravelingThroughTheDarkPoembyWilliamStafford,"Traveling through the dark I found a deer
dead on the edge of the Wilson River road.
It is usually best to roll them into the canyon:
that road is narrow; to swerve might make more dead.
By glow of the tail-light I stumbled back of the car
and stood by the heap, a doe, a recent killing;
she had stiffened already, almost cold.
I dragged her off; she was large in the belly.
My fingers touching her side brought me the reason--
her side was warm; her fawn lay there waiting,
alive, still, never to be born.
Beside that mountain road I hesitated.
The car aimed ahead its lowered parking lights;
under the hood purred the steady engine.
I stood in the glare of the warm exhaust turning red;
around our group I could hear the wilderness listen.
I thought hard for us all--my only swerving--,
then pushed her over the edge into the river."
663,Emotion,DarkPoemsLonelyInTheDarkPoembynouriblack,"I am living in the darkness
I feel so scared
I feel unsafe
I dont know what to do
I cry everyday and night
And I feel that I want to cry more and more
Non stop
It really dark here
I hear my mom voice
But I cant reach her
And I hear my friends calling me
But they cant hear me
I dont know what to do
I start screaming and screaming
But suddenly their voices r gone
They leave me all alone in the darkness
I start crying again and again
And suddenly
A light so weak appears, shivering in the dark
I didnt know what it was
I feel so endangered
I saw an extended hand
That wants to grab me towards its unrevealed body
I ran away
I hear a male vioce
Calling my name
Telling me that he wants to save me
I turn and look at him
I thought he was just like an angel
Just like an angel in a human body
With flesh and blood
He took my hand
To show me the way
When I was out of the dark
He gave me a butterfly
He gave me a butterfly
And with it
He filled my heart with hope
Gave me a reason to never give up
Just knowing that some one,
Somewhere
Actually cared about me,
Loved me
That will give me all the strength i need to live
To survive"
664,Emotion,DarkPoemsGacelaOfTheDarkDeathPoembyFedericoGarcíaLorca,"I want to sleep the dream of the apples,
to withdraw from the tumult of cemetries.
I want to sleep the dream of that child
who wanted to cut his heart on the high seas.
I don't want to hear again that the dead do not lose their blood,
that the putrid mouth goes on asking for water.
I don't want to learn of the tortures of the grass,
nor of the moon with a serpent's mouth
that labors before dawn.
I want to sleep awhile,
awhile, a minute, a century;
but all must know that I have not died;
that there is a stable of gold in my lips;
that I am the small friend of the West wing;
that I am the intense shadows of my tears.
Cover me at dawn with a veil,
because dawn will throw fistfuls of ants at me,
and wet with hard water my shoes
so that the pincers of the scorpion slide.
For I want to sleep the dream of the apples,
to learn a lament that will cleanse me to earth;
for I want to live with that dark child
who wanted to cut his heart on the high seas."

666,Emotion,DarkPoemsTheDarkStagPoembyIsabellaValancyCrawford,"1       A startled stag, the blue-grey Night,
2           Leaps down beyond black pines.
3       Behind--a length of yellow light--
4           The hunter's arrow shines:
5       His moccasins are stained with red,
6           He bends upon his knee,
7       From covering peaks his shafts are sped,
8       The blue mists plume his mighty head,--
9           Well may the swift Night flee!
10     The pale, pale Moon, a snow-white doe,
11         Bounds by his dappled flank:
12     They beat the stars down as they go,
13         Like wood-bells growing rank.
14     The winds lift dewlaps from the ground,
15         Leap from the quaking reeds;
16     Their hoarse bays shake the forests round,
17     With keen cries on the track they bound,--
18         Swift, swift the dark stag speeds!
19     Away! his white doe, far behind,
20         Lies wounded on the plain;
21     Yells at his flank the nimblest wind,
22         His large tears fall in rain;
23     Like lily-pads, small clouds grow white
24         About his darkling way;
25     From his bald nest upon the height
26     The red-eyed eagle sees his flight;
27     He falters, turns, the antlered Night,--
28         The dark stag stands at bay!
29     His feet are in the waves of space;
30         His antlers broad and dun
31     He lowers; he turns his velvet face
32         To front the hunter, Sun;
33     He stamps the lilied clouds, and high
34         His branches fill the west.
35     The lean stork sails across the sky,
36     The shy loon shrieks to see him die,
37         The winds leap at his breast.
38     Roar the rent lakes as thro' the wave
39         Their silver warriors plunge,
40     As vaults from core of crystal cave
41         The strong, fierce muskallunge;
42     Red torches of the sumach glare,
43         Fall's council-fires are lit;
44     The bittern, squaw-like, scolds the air;
45     The wild duck splashes loudly where
46         The rustling rice-spears knit.
47     Shaft after shaft the red Sun speeds:
48         Rent the stag's dappled side,
49     His breast, fanged by the shrill winds, bleeds,
50         He staggers on the tide;
51     He feels the hungry waves of space
52         Rush at him high and blue;
53     Their white spray smites his dusky face,
54     Swifter the Sun's fierce arrows race
55         And pierce his stout heart thro'.
56     His antlers fall; once more he spurns
57         The hoarse hounds of the day;
58     His blood upon the crisp blue burns,
59         Reddens the mounting spray;
60     His branches smite the wave--with cries
61         The loud winds pause and flag--
62     He sinks in space--red glow the skies,
63     The brown earth crimsons as he dies,
64         The strong and dusky stag."

668,Emotion,DarkPoemsInTheDarkAlleywayPoembyCharlesMMoore,"I felt her smile like the rays of the sun
approaching me I almost felt she would run
calling my name with a pleasuring glee
excitingly glorious she came to me
We talked and we laughed holding hands in the park
a crisp winters morning we felt the ice crack
old friends and old lovers like we just met
remembering times we could never forget
Back in our teens we ran wild through the streets
with friends in a gang and the world at our feet
mischief and trouble were things we knew well
trust was a byword for love that we felt
We became closer and needed more time
exploring emotions we just had to find
that first teenage kiss in the dark alleyway
still with us eternal remembered today
The broken Coke sign flickering in the cafe
we nervously laughed as it flashed Cok each day
all through the winter we huddled and talked
encouraging moments that we couldn't stop
Our friends drifted off somewhere in the unknown
as we bonded closer in love on our own
enjoying the pleasures of body and mind
as teenagers do as they grow through that time
We tried to make plans for the future I guess
but we were just amateurs out of our depth
as the spring came it melted the snow and our dreams
and we stretched our wings seeking different things
Forty years on at the roadside cafe
the Coke sign still flickers as we nervously
smile at each other and remember the day
of that first teenage kiss in the dark alleyway."

670,Emotion,DarkPoemsCryingByNightsOnDarkEveningsPoembyVernazeraLumba,"As far as I remembered,
We were friends since forever,
Each other we never hated
Because we controlled our temper
But slowly we separated
And our laughter slowly faded
Our communication failed to start
Birthday cards became belated
And although we are apart
You are still in my heart
But for our friendship I hold fear
It’s going down hill in a wheeled cart
I hope someday you will reappear
And someday that you’ll be near
For every night I cry tears
For every night I cry tears"
671,Emotion,DarkPoemsDarkInMePoembyBrianDorn,"Welcome to my haunted house
Dare to see the dark in me
Suits of armor wait to joust
Eyes in portraits move to see
Stroke my ego, don't be shy
Give my id his equal pay
Watch the serpent slither by
My alter ego's chance to play
In the dungeon sleeps the creature
Securely cuffed in mounted chains
Disregard his ragged features
Please excuse the carpet stains
Behind the bookcase hides my secrets
Discretion swept up under rugs
The dark in me you haven't met
Struggles loose in warring tugs
Tempting me in carnal pleasure
Rewarding me if I dare
Accolades in grand measure
Disposing me in deep despair"

amazing how much credence is given to idiot forms of life

The shades are drawn...,
While waiting impatiently....,
For the dawn....,
I'm Shivering In The Dark...,
Lonely and scared....,
Shivering In The Dark...,
In the far distance...,

Calling for you....,

Shivering In The Dark...,
Waiting, wondering, quivering...,

674,Emotion,DarkPoemsDarkDarkDarkPoembyTomasPrato,"O dark, dark, dark, amid the blaze of noon,
Irrecoverably dark, total eclipse
Without all hope of day!
As I enter the dark world of this online poetry site
(Darker than the darkest night)
I feel that I should abandon all hope
(Is this the gate of hell?
Have they cast a witch's spell
Over all who enter here?
Vague forms dangling from ropes,
Shapeless figures drowning in overheated sludge.
They're mucking about, each one a hypocritical drudge.
I smell fear and despair
In the noxious asphyxiating air.
I see sentences hacked to death,
And stanzas swooning (out of breath) .
The complete absence of punctuation marks
Makes the poems ooze with slime
(There's not even a trace of rhyme!) .
I feel I am drowning in some deep dark well.
Am I in the nethermost chambers of hell?
I've lost my sight, but not my smell
(These poetic hacks cannot even spell!)
What makes things worse is the way
They butter one another up
With gushing praise and false accolades,
Every one of them, with failed grades,
Unable to write a poem that's tolerable,
Though I must say their versions
Are hideously ‘holler'-able!"
675,Emotion,DarkPoemsDarkPoembyfarzanahossain,"Dark is a shade of my heart.
When I close my eyes I see a ray of light in dark.
It gives me pleasure of finding you in dark.
It gives me life of your existence.
It gives me passion of your adorable touches.
I always want to close my eyes to see u in dark.
This is the way I want you.
When I open my eyes you are not in my mind.
It gives me sorrow of losing you in dark.
It gives me confusion of your existence.
It gives me loneliness when I am surrounding with people.
I never wanted to open my eyes cause I love you.
This is the way I love you."
676,Emotion,DarkPoemsDarkNightPoembyFrankBidart,"In a dark night, when the light
burning was the burning of love (fortuitous
night, fated, free,--)
as I stole from my dark house, dark
house that was silent, grave, sleeping,--
by the staircase that was secret, hidden,
safe: disguised by darkness (fortuitous
night, fated, free,--)
by darkness and by cunning, dark
house that was silent, grave, sleeping--;
in that sweet night, secret, seen by
no one and seeing
nothing, my only light or
guide
the burning in my burning heart,
night was the guide
to the place where he for whom I
waited, whom I had long ago chosen,
waits: night
brighter than noon, in which none can see--;
night was the guide
sweeter than the sun raw at
dawn, for there the burning bridegroom is
bride
and he who chose at last is chosen.
*
As he lay sleeping on my sleepless
breast, kept from the beginning for him
alone, lying on the gift I gave
as the restless
fragrant cedars moved the restless winds,--
winds from the circling parapet circling
us as I lay there touching and lifting his hair,--
with his sovereign hand, he
wounded my neck-
and my senses, when they touched that, touched nothing...
In a dark night	(there where I
lost myself,--) as I leaned to rest
in his smooth white breast, everything
ceased
and left me, forgotten in the grave of forgotten lilies."

678,Emotion,DarkPoemsADarkEveningPoembyRichardAnsell,"The poppies bow in honour of the fallen,
Swaying in the breeze, in fear of time,
Red gaping wounds upon the planets corpse,
Each scarlet petal a tear shed for our crimes,
Worn in remembrance of our shame…
Storm clouds gather, predicting repetition,
The starless grey sky prepares to weep
It’s bitter flood upon the sighing earth,
The murky light its secret tries to keep,
Believing its disgrace can be disguised…
A waning line of light takes one last breath,
Choking on blood the lonely flowers shed,
Heaven laments the passing of their bloom,
Angels and artists cry requiem for the dead,
Silence descends upon a once bright evening…"

digs sharply into my flesh
As the black veil of my existence

As the flame of my thoughts move in
rapid circles and become a mere line
As the vulture of pervading questions

As the furnace of my yearning
bakes it into a solemn comprehension
That this is the Enddddddddddd."
680,Emotion,DarkPoemsTheDarkHousePoembySiegfriedSassoon,"Dusk in the rain-soaked garden,
And dark the house within.
A door creaked: someone was early
To watch the dawn begin.
But he stole away like a thief
In the chilly, star-bright air:
Though the house was shuttered for slumber,
He had left one wakeful there.
Nothing moved in the garden.
Never a bird would sing,
Nor shake and scatter the dew from the boughs
With shy and startled wing.
But when that lover had passed the gate
A quavering thrush began...
‘Come back; come back!’ he shrilled to the heart
Of the passion-plighted man."
681,Emotion,DarkPoemse2DarkTheAbyssBeckonsPoembyRenuRakhejaakaTranquilOcean,"The abyss yawns and beckons....
Its so easy to dropp in
To just give up the resistance
And get drawn
by the magnetic force within....
Feel the joy of the sheer slide
as you go deep down
Did you indulge in all sins?
Did you revere the demons?
Just close your eyes
and enjoy the slide
Listen to the sound
of your soul's laughter
mocking you.....
Make the soul flee
from your body
Revel in it
Dwell in it
Celebrate your freedom
Now no need to abstain from
any form of sin
Let the journey begin....

682,Emotion,DarkPoemsTheDarkCloudOfDepressionPoembyMichaelShepherd,"The dark cloud.
It sits around your head
or inside it, more like.
Around your mind,
or inside it.
Around your heart,
or inside it.
Does it reach your knees?
Seems like it, some days.
Your toenails perhaps?
If you let it, it has a voice.
Please don’t listen to it;
that’s really dangerous;
it makes general statements
as if it knows you better than you know yourself
like, ‘your…’ - no, it claims to  BE you -
so, it’s ‘MY life is pointless..’
Have you noticed, it’s
never in front of you,
always somewhere behind you,
whispering over your shoulder
so on a bad day, it’s there in the bed with you
the moment you awake; not of course
in kissing range, that might be fun – but behind you,
murmuring in a bedly voice
‘WE are really down this morning aren’t WE? ’
or it catches up with you in the bathroom
or a bit later, like when you review the day’s appointments
or start out for work.
The First Aid for depression is of course well known
(to everyone else, at some other time…) :
put some music on, sing in the shower,
sit in the brightest light,
toast your hidden beautiful self
in orange juice; take some vigorous exercise,
seek out good company in
someone or something; be
good company yourself, for someone else..
they all work, for a time; but don’t you wish
for the classic fairy tale encounter –
there you are walking through the dark wood
of the dark cloud, and suddenly
the monster springs out in front of you
in all its horror; for the first time
you meet it face to face; it’s
terrifying, but a curious relief:
now you know it’s not you after all,
but something else; you look it in the eye,
you don’t retreat, but march towards it,
say Boo (for linguistic reasons, rather abstruse)
and as you get nearer and nearer to it, the monster
gets smaller and smaller, until…
and then, marching back
triumphant with a spring in your step,
you may feel like
nailing it with a poem, to say
wow I’ve survived;
have a great day!"
683,Emotion,DarkPoemsDarkSupernaturalSkillsPoembyUriahHamilton,"Urgency of frantic desire
Requires witchcraft
Or that I become
A mystical gypsy
Reading fortunes and the future
By tea leaves or the alignment of the stars
In the cryptic and magical sky.
I have already read my misfortune in your eyes,
And that my every fragile hope to be with you
Flees like a frightened child,
That the path is mapped
For me to become a man of your distant past,
Driven further and further
From your memories.
If I could only learn
Dark supernatural skills
That could transform fate
Into ardent dreams,
Then you would linger here
In a blissful embrace."
684,Emotion,DarkPoemsDarkAngelPoembySteveArmstrong,"I see you now,
and it makes me cry in my heart,
one so beautiful, and yet,
so damaged and messed up inside.
The scars that line your arms,
look like the intricate artwork of a tattooist,
those razor cuts and puncture wounds,
signs of a desparate cry for help.
That vacant look upon your face,
the doctors miracle cure;
Prozac, takes all your troubles away,
but all it does is pushes them deeper inside.
I see you now,
and it makes me cry in my heart,
one so beautiful, and yet,
so damaged and messed up inside.

685,Emotion,DarkPoemsMySoulIsDarkPoembyGeorgeGordonByron,"My soul is dark - Oh! quickly string
The harp I yet can brook to hear;
And let thy gentle fingers fling
Its melting murmurs o'er mine ear.
If in this heart a hope be dear,
That sound shall charm it forth again:
If in these eyes there lurk a tear,
'Twill flow, and cease to burn my brain.
But bid the strain be wild and deep,
Nor let thy notes of joy be first:
I tell thee, minstrel, I must weep,
Or else this heavy heart will burst;
For it hath been by sorrow nursed,
And ached in sleepless silence, long;
And now 'tis doomed to know the worst,
And break at once - or yield to song."
686,Emotion,DarkPoemsWeGrowAccustomedToTheDarkPoembyEmilyDickinson,"We grow accustomed to the Dark -
When light is put away -
As when the Neighbor holds the Lamp
To witness her Goodbye -
A Moment -  We uncertain step
For newness of the night -
Then -  fit our Vision to the Dark -
And meet the Road -  erect -
And so of larger -  Darknesses -
Those Evenings of the Brain -
When not a Moon disclose a sign -
Or Star -  come out -  within -
The Bravest -  grope a little -
And sometimes hit a Tree
Directly in the Forehead -
But as they learn to see -
Either the Darkness alters -
Or something in the sight
Adjusts itself to Midnight -
And Life steps almost straight."

Raging tempest
Anguished quest
Died a thousand deaths
Trying to set love on the breath

Before you die
Run, escape
Before you get raped
By your own mind
Thats made you blind

Soar up to the sky
Along the length of my thigh
Wings of your fancy and fly
Up, up, high, high
Join me inside
Inside my love, Die....."

690,Emotion,DarkPoemsTheDarkGirlsRhymePoembyDorothyParker,"Who was there had seen us
Wouldn't bid him run?
Heavy lay between us
All our sires had done.
There he was, a-springing
Of a pious race,
Setting hags a-swinging
In a market-place;
Sowing turnips over
Where the poppies lay;
Looking past the clover,
Adding up the hay;
Shouting through the Spring song,
Clumping down the sod;
Toadying, in sing-song,
To a crabbed god.
There I was, that came of
Folk of mud and name-
I that had my name of
Them without a name.
Up and down a mountain
Streeled my silly stock;
Passing by a fountain,
Wringing at a rock;
Devil-gotten sinners,
Throwing back their heads,
Fiddling for their dinners,
Kissing for their beds.
Not a one had seen us
Wouldn't help him flee.
Angry ran between us
Blood of him and me.
How shall I be mating
Who have looked above-
Living for a hating,
Dying of a love?"
691,Emotion,DarkPoemsBeholdAsGoblinsDarkOfMienPoembyRobertLouisStevenson,"BEHOLD, as goblins dark of mien
And portly tyrants dyed with crime
Change, in the transformation scene,
At Christmas, in the pantomime,
Instanter, at the prompter's cough,
The fairy bonnets them, and they
Throw their abhorred carbuncles off
And blossom like the flowers in May.
- So mankind, to angelic eyes,
So, through the scenes of life below,
In life's ironical disguise,
A travesty of man, ye go:
But fear not: ere the curtain fall,
Death in the transformation scene
Steps forward from her pedestal,
Apparent, as the fairy Queen;
And coming, frees you in a trice
From all your lendings - lust of fame,
Ungainly virtue, ugly vice,
Terror and tyranny and shame.
So each, at last himself, for good
In that dear country lays him down,
At last beloved and understood
And pure in feature and renown."

soldiers have hunted,
borne behind doors
that have been kicked open
to drain the blood and flesh
of its nutrients, its life,
has left me
in this home of captive breeding,
stripped in the buffer zone of womanhood.
But thinking
that on that day,
I could have also died by a bullet,
I crawled and crawled
away from that house
to the foot of a cypress,
as desperate as one was,
to be left for dead.

in a marshland of linens, and bedsprings

borne in a runoff
of placenta and amniotic fluid,
tainting her own milk and blood.
But on that day,
she had taken the infant
from her womb, brushed his head
with fingers as light as feathers,
and snapped it back
like the cattail dies back in autumn
with thousands of seeds
blown to the wind—
thousands more
than deemed too many."

A poor farmer with no name,
Ploughing cloudward, sowing the wind
With squalls of gulls at the day's end.
To me you are Prytherch, the man
Who more than all directed my slow
Charity where there was need.
There are two hungers, hunger for bread
And hunger of the uncouth soul
For the light's grace. I have seen both,
And chosen for an indulgent world's
Ear the story of one whose hands
Have bruised themselves on the locked doors
Of life; whose heart, fuller than mine
Of gulped tears, is the dark well
From which to draw, drop after drop,
The terrible poetry of his kind."

A mind that is fraught
With delusions about his genius
And a sea of dissatisfaction
Yearning to reach a bliss
Hanging by his dark desires
Burning in his blazing fire
The Vampire lurks.....
Led by a belief
That he will get his release
Riding on her dreams
As he spots her, his inner eye gleams
He gets a whiff of the expanded soul
And he wants ALL of it to make him whole
The light that will glorify him
The Vampire strikes....."

an terminable talking, talking
of no consequence--patter, patter, patter.
Hand in hand little winds
blow the thin streams aslant.
Warm. Distance cut off. Seclusion.

hurry from one place to another.
Winds of the white poppy! there is no escape!--
An interminable talking, talking,
talking . . .it has happened before.
Backward, backward, backward."

The flood waters rise
Upon Virtue’s plains
To choke the humble and meek,
Drowning the memory
Of my name
Through tyranny and oppression
Unto the weak.

You cannot be surpassed in fair Scotland.
Tis healthy for holiday makers, to go there,
For the benefit of their health, by inhaling the pure air
And to hear the innocent birds, on a fine Summer day,
Carolling their sweet songs, so lively and gay,
Therefore, holiday makers, be advised by me,
And visit beautiful Rothesay, by the side of the Sea.
Then sweet Jessie, let us go,
To Scotland's garden of Eden O!
And spend the lovely Summer day,
In the beautiful village of Rothesay.
There you can see the ships, passing to and fro,
Which will drive away dull care, and woe,
And, the heavens breath smells wooingly there,
Therefore, let's away dear Jessie, to inhale the balmy air.
The mansions, there, are most beautiful to be seen,
Likewise the trees, and shrubberies, green.
Therefore, we will feel happy and gay,
Walking hand in hand, together the live long day.
Along the beautiful walks with our hearts fu' cheerie,
My dear love! Until we grow weary.
Then, return home at night, with our spirits light and gay,
After viewing the beautiful scenery of Rothesay."
700,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsBeautifulNewportOnTheBraesOTheSilveryTayPoembyWilliamTopazMcGonagall,"Bonnie Mary, the Maid o' the Tay,
Come! Let's go, and have a holiday
In Newport, on the braes o' the silvery Tay,
'Twill help to drive dull care away.
The scenery there is most enchanting to be seen,
Especially the fine mansions with their shrubbery green;
And the trees and ivy are beautiful to view
Growing in front of each stately home in the avenue.
There the little birds and beautiful butterflies
Are soaring heavenwards almost to the skies,
And the busy bees are to be seen on the wing,
As from flower to flower they hummingly sing,
As they gather honey all the day,
From flowery gardens of Newport on the braes o' the Tay.
And as we view the gardens our hearts will feel gay
After being pent up in the workshop all the day.
Then there's a beautiful spot near an old mill,
Suitable for an artist to paint of great skill,
And the trees are arched o'erhead, lovely to be seen,
Which screens ye from the sunshine's glittering sheen.
Therefore, holiday makers, I'd have ye resort
To Newport on the braes o' the Tay for sport,
And inhale the pure air with its sweet perfume,
Emanating from the flowery gardens of Newport and the yellow broom.
And when bright Sol sinks in the West
You'll return home at night quite refreshed,
And dream in your beds of your rambles during the day
Along the bonnie braes o' the silvery Tay."
701,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsTheBeautifulSunPoembyWilliamTopazMcGonagall,"Beautiful Sun! with thy golden rays,
To God, the wise Creator, be all praise;
For thou nourisheth all the creation,
Wherever there is found to be animation.
Without thy heat we could not live,
Then praise to God we ought to give;
For thou makest the fruits and provisions to grow,
To nourish all creatures on earth below.
Thou makest the hearts of the old feel glad,
Likewise the young child and the lad,
And the face of Nature to look green and gay,
And the little children to sport and play.
Thou also givest light unto the Moon,
Which certainly is a very great boon
To all God's creatures here below,
Throughout the world where'er they go.
How beautiful thou look'st on a summer morn,
When thou sheddest thy effulgence among the yellow corn,
Also upon lake, and river, and the mountain tops,
Whilst thou leavest behind the most lovely dewdrops!
How beautiful thou seem'st in the firmament above,
As I gaze upon thee, my heart fills with love
To God, the great Creator, Who has placed thee there,
Who watches all His creatures with an eye of care!
Thou makest the birds to sing on the tree,
Also by meadow, mountain, and lea;
And the lark high poised up in air,
Carolling its little song with its heart free from care.
Thou makest the heart of the shepherd feel gay
As he watches the little lambkins at their innocent play;
While he tends them on the hillside all day,
Taking care that none of them shall go astray.
Thou cheerest the weary traveller while on his way
During the livelong summer day,
As he admires the beautiful scenery while passing along,
And singing to himself a stave of a song.
Thou cheerest the tourist while amongst the Highland hills,
As he views their beautiful sparkling rills
Glittering like diamonds by the golden rays,
While the hills seem to offer up to God their praise.
While the bee from flower to flower does roam
To gather honey, and carry it home;
While it hums its little song in the beautiful sunshine,
And seemingly to thank the Creator divine --
For the honey it hath gathered during the day,
In the merry month of May,
When the flowers are in full bloom,
Also the sweet honeysuckle and the broom.
How beautiful thy appearance while setting in the west,
Whilst encircled with red and azure, 'tis then thou look'st best!
Then let us all thank God for thy golden light
In our prayers every morning and night!"
702,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsTheBeautifulLawnSprinklerPoembyHowardNemerov,"What gives it power makes it change its mind
At each extreme, and lean its rising rain
Down low, first one and then the other way;
In which exchange humility and pride
Reverse, forgive, arise, and die again,
Wherefore it holds at both ends of the day
The rainbow in its scattering grains of spray.

703,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsTheTwoGuidesOfLifeTheSublimeAndTheBeautifulPoembyFriedrichSchiller,"Two genii are there, from thy birth through weary life to guide thee;
Ah, happy when, united both, they stand to aid beside thee?
With gleesome play to cheer the path, the one comes blithe with beauty,
And lighter, leaning on her arm, the destiny and duty.
With jest and sweet discourse she goes unto the rock sublime,
Where halts above the eternal sea the shuddering child of time.
The other here, resolved and mute and solemn, claspeth thee,
And bears thee in her giant arms across the fearful sea.
Never admit the one alone!--Give not the gentle guide
Thy honor--nor unto the stern thy happiness confide!"

If only I could write a beautiful love poem

705,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsColorfullyBeautifulPoembyPaulMoosberg,"Pink’s pretty passion, Red’s re-revelries
Blue’s babbling brook, Green’s gracefully glee
Purple’s past presence, Orange's overseas
Yellow’s young yearning, your Love sets me free
Beautiful ranting, of rain color sill
Colors a picture, as image stands still
Full of all fullness, my heart’s past its fill
Loving you darling, with all of my will"
706,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsBeautifulRosePoembyHenryClayWork,"Off on the prairie, where the balmy air
Kisses the waving corn,
There lives a farmer, with a daughter fair--
Fair as a summer's morn!
She has a nature gentle as a dove,
Pure as the mountain snows;
Say! is it strange that everyone should love--
Love such a girl as Rose?
Beautiful Rose! lovely Rose!
Pride of the prairie bower!
Everybody loves her--everybody knows
She is the fairest flower.
Rose is a lady yet from early dawn,
Labors her skillful hand;
She is the housewife, now her mother's gone--
Gone to the better land.
Rose has the beauty--father has the gold--
Both will be hers one day;
For she is young, while he is growing old--
Old people pass away.
Clerks from the city, plowmen from the field,
Lords from a foreign land;
Each in their turn have very humbly kneeled--
Kneeled for her heart and hand.
But to them all she made the same reply--
Kindly but firmly, ""No!""
And none but I can tell the reason why--
Why she should treat them so."
707,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsGrayIsBeautifulPoembySandraFowler,"You shape my bones into your hunting coat.
Rain slants like needles through the falling air.
The field is vast with the old blood of leaves.
Fire in the windows warms my eyes to sleep.
Trees interlace the hills with gray patchwork.
I feel your fingers mend my broken wings.
Wind fades your name into a thread of smoke.
I cry its incandescence through my dreams.
We must believe that gray is beautiful,
East still exists although its outlines dim.
I feel the wind of dawn upon my face.
Put your hand there, and you will feel it too.

708,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsBeautifulLittleStrangerPoembyAnoopLokkur,"As I walked down the steps,
my eyes caught your innocence.
The moisture on your lips
inviting to be kissed.
Your firm suple breast
could not make me rest;
And as you walked towards me
all I wanted was us to be alone.
As I see you bid farewell,
I wish to see you again.
But in my mind you shall remain forever
as my beautiful little stranger"
709,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsTheBeautifulLandOfNodPoembyEllaWheelerWilcox,"Come, cuddle your head on my shoulder, dear,
Your head like the golden-rod,
And we will go sailing away from here
To the beautiful land of Nod.
Away from life’s hurry, and flurry, and worry,
Away from earth’s shadows and gloom,
To a world of fair weather we’ll float off together
Where the roses are always in bloom.
Just shut up your eyes, and fold your hands,
Your hands like the leaves of a rose,
And we will go sailing to those fair lands
That an atlas never shows.
On the North and the West they are bounded by rest,
On the South and the East by dreams;
‘Tis the country ideal, where nothing is real,
But everything only seems.
Just dropp down the curtains of your dear eyes,
Those eyes like a bright blue-bell,
And we will sail out under starlit skies
To the land where the fairies dwell.
Down the river of sleep our barque  shall sweep,
Till it reaches the mystical isle
Which no man has seen, but where all have been,
And there we will pause for awhile.
I will croon you a song as we float along,
To that shore that is blessed of God,
Then ho! for that fair land, we’re off for that rare land,
That beautiful Land of Nod."

711,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsBeautifulBlueEyesPoembyGraceHays,"Blue eyes so full of life
A wonder all of their own
So beautiful and precious
Oh to see those eyes smile
Such a beautiful sight
How I love to look into those eyes
When I look into them
A kind of peace comes over me
Beautiful blue eyes
Always haunting me
...teasing me
Reminding me of what I want...can't have
Why do they haunt me so
When will I be free of them
Constantly held captive by those blue eyes
Beautiful blue eyes
Always there
A reminder of what I want...can't have
Such beautiful blue eyes
Beautiful blue eyes..."
712,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsBeautifulPoembyGraceTan,"Don’t cover your face with your long bangs;
Try to hide your figure with your hands.
Look away when eyes lock into yours
Because you feel
They’ll cringe at the sight.
Don’t converse with the floor when you walk;
Avoid all the people that pass.
Slouch down, hunchbacked, in a crowd
Desperately, trying hard
To merge with the ground.
Don’t tell yourself you won’t pass;
Talk in a whisper.
Contract your open hand, fist it,
Drawing in,
Clutched tightly with your heart.
Don’t frown at your image on the tainted glassframe;
Look at me- I mean what I say.
Stand tall. Chest up. Look straight.
I twirled you around.
Tucked a stray hair gently behind your ear,
Wiped off the tears with my hands
And stared.
You’re beautiful.
So many have yet to see, my friend.
When our world and views are so blemished;
Superficial reigning like an implorable mountain,
Where minds cannot compass through the mists
To find the unsullied hearts below.
But even if this unwinding path continues
Let time not wait, and pass,
But mine voice to you
Past your teary eyes,
Gaze upon you, and whisper:
Beautiful.

713,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsBeautifulBalmerinoPoembyWilliamTopazMcGonagall,"Beautiful Balmermo on the bonnie banks of Tay,
It's a very bonnie spot in the months of June or May;
The scenery there is charming and fascinating to see,
Especially the surroundings of the old Abbey,
Which is situated in the midst of trees on a rugged hill,
Which visitors can view at their own free will;
And the trees and shrubberies are lovely to view,
Especially the trees on each side of the avenue
Which leads up to the Abbey amongst the trees;
And in the summer time it's frequented with bees,
And also crows with their unmusical cry,
Which is a great annoyance to the villagers that live near by.
And there in the summer season the mavis sings,
And with her charming notes the woodland rings;
And the sweet-scented zephyrs is borne upon the gale,
Which is most refreshing and invigorating to inhale.
Then there's the stately Castle of Balmerino
Situated in the midst of trees, a magnificent show,
And bordering on the banks o' the silvery Tay,
Where visitors can spend a happy holiday.
As they view the castle and scenery around
It will help to cheer their spirits I'll be bound;
And if they wish to view Wormit Bay
They can walk along the braes o' the silvery Tay."

Now your nightdress
hides from me
slinks under covers and pillows

When the cool breeze touches me

When you are under my arms

When I say my night prayers

You hold the heavens above

wherever I go
Your friends the sun and moon
are your eyes and ears
the moon shines bright through the night
to sooth a child's fears
A tree starts as a seed

that sometimes shoot across your beautiful face
You can see them up in space
Look at the sky
Cause it is watching you
and when you see a rainbow
Your wishes will come true"
718,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsTheBeautifulCityOfPerthPoembyWilliamTopazMcGonagall,"Beautiful Ancient City of Perth,
One of the grandest on the earth,
With your stately mansions and streets so clean,
And situated between two Inches green,
Which are most magnificent to be seen
The North Inch is beautiful to behold,
Where the daisies and butter-cups their petals unfold,
In the warm summer time of the year,
While the clear silvery Tay rolls by quite near,
And such a scene will your spirits cheer.
The South Inch is lovely, be it said,
And a splendid spot for military parade,
While along the highway there are some big trees,
Where the soldiers can rest or stand at ease,
Whichever way their commanders please.
The surrounding woodland scenery is very grand,
It cannot be surpassed in fair Scotland,
Especially the elegant Palace of Scone, in history renowned,
Where some of Scotland's kings were crowned.
And the Fair Maid of Perth's house is worthy to be seen,
Which is well worth visiting by Duke, Lord, or Queen;
The Fair Maid of Perth caused the battle on the North Inch
'Twixt the Clans Chattan and Kay, and neither of them did flinch,
Until they were cut up inch by inch.
The scenery is lovely in the month of June,
When trees and flowers are in full bloom,
Especially near by the Palace of Scone,
Where the blackbird is heard whistling all day
While near by rolls on the clear silvery Tay.
Of all the cities in Scotland, beautiful Perth for me,
For it is the most elegant city that ever I did see,
With its beautiful woodland scenery along the river Tay,
Which would make the tourist's heart feel gay,
While fishing for trout on a fine summer day.
There, the angler, if he likes to resort
For a few day's fishing, can have excellent sport,
And while he is fishing during the day,
He will feel delighted with the scenery along the river Tay.
And the fish he catches will drive dull care away,
And his toil will be rewarded for the fatigues of the day.
Beautiful city of Perth, magnificent to be seen,
With your grand statues and Inches green,
And your lovely maidens fair and gay,
Which, in conclusion, I will venture to say,
You cannot be surpassed at the present day."
719,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsBeautifulAberfoylePoembyWilliamTopazMcGonagall,"The mountains and glens of Aberfoyle are beautiful to sight,
Likewise the rivers and lakes are sparkling and bright;
And its woods were frequented by the Lady of the Lake,
And on its Lakes many a sail in her boat she did take.
The scenery there will fill the tourist with joy,
Because 'tis there once lived the bold Rob Roy,
Who spent many happy days with his Helen there,
By chasing the deer in the woods so fair.
The little vale of Aberfoyle and its beautiful river
Is a sight, once seen, forget it you'll never;
And romantic ranges of rock on either side
Form a magnificent background far and wide.
And the numerous lochs there abound with trout
Which can be had for the taking out,
Especially from the Lochs Chon and Ard,
There the angler can make a catch which will his toil reward.
And between the two lochs the Glasgow Water Works are near,
Which convey water of Loch Katrine in copious streams clear
To the inhabitants of the Great Metropolis of the West,
And for such pure water they should think themselves blest.
The oak and birch woods there are beautiful to view,
Also the Ochil hills which are blue in hue,
Likewise the Lake of Menteith can be seen far eastward,
Also Stirling Castle, which long ago the English beseiged very hard.
Then away to Aberfoyle, Rob Roy's country,
And gaze on the magnificent scenery.
A region of rivers and mountains towering majestically
Which is lovely and fascinating to see.
But no words can describe the beautiful scenery.
Aberfoyle must be visited in order to see,
So that the mind may apprehend its beauties around,
Which will charm the hearts of the visitors I'll be bound.
As for the clachan of aberfoyle, little remains but a hotel,
Which for accomodation which will suit the traveller very well.
And the bedding thereis clean and good,
And good cooks there to cook the food.
Then away to the mountains and lakes of bonnie Aberfoyle,
Ye hard-working sons and daughters of daily toil;
And traverse its heathery mountains and viewits lakes so clear,
When the face of Nature's green in the spring of the year."
720,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsTheBeautifulAmericanWordSurePoembyDelmoreSchwartz,"The beautiful American word, Sure,
As I have come into a room, and touch
The lamp's button, and the light blooms with such
Certainty where the darkness loomed before,
As I care for what I do not know, and care
Knowing for little she might not have been,
And for how little she would be unseen,
The intercourse of lives miraculous and dear.
Where the light is, and each thing clear,
separate from all others, standing in its place,
I drink the time and touch whatever's near,
And hope for day when the whole world has that face:
For what assures her present every year?
In dark accidents the mind's sufficient grace."
721,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsSomethingBeautifulPoembyMaxReif,"Something beautiful
You gave me,
Alive and
Needing care,
And though I tried
To nurture it,
It wound up
Dead and bare.
Something in me
Strangled it,
Crushed its frail
Life out,
And having sought
To love it
I felt shame
And guilt
And doubt.
You gave me then
Another gift,
Beautiful and fresh.
Again I snuffed its spirit out.
Again I brought it death,
For something in me murderous
Upon it took its toll
As I tried to nourish it
With all my heart and soul.
And now I stand
Beside my life
Of painful memories.
Don't let this happen
Any more. Oh, don't
Allow it, please!
Send me to the Grower's School,
To learn to nurture free
The precious gifts You send my way —
To let them grow and be,
To join them in a love song
Ever beautiful and new,
Full of joyous spirit
Of gratitude to You."
722,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsBeautifulBeyondDoubtPoembyDavidTaylor,"A shimmering of your hair
As I glance in awe
A quiver of your lips
As I swallow in anticipation
A flashing of your eyes
As I stand near not far
A movement of your hips
As I watch you walk
A gesture of your hand
As I lower my lips
A laughter in the air
As I make another quip
A sigh from deep within
As I tell you my intent
A gasp from tender breast
As I look so deep within
A tremble in your legs
As I make you remember
And you have absolutely no doubt
Beauty is in the making
Through each breath
Each of us are together taking."
723,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsLinesInReplyToTheBeautifulPoetWhoWelcomedNewsOfMcgonagallsDepartureFromDundeePoembyWilliamTopazMcGonagall,"Dear Johnny, I return my thanks to you;
But more than thanks is your due
For publishing the scurrilous poetry about me
Leaving the Ancient City of Dundee.
The rhymster says, we'll weary for your schauchlin' form;
But if I'm not mistaken I've seen bonnier than his in a field of corn;
And, as I venture to say and really suppose,
His form seen in a cornfield would frighten the crows.
But, dear Johnny, as you said, he's just a lampoon,
And as ugly and as ignorant as a wild baboon;
And, as far as I can judge or think,
He is a vendor of strong drink.
He says my nose would make a peasemeal warrior weep;
But I've seen a much bonnier sweep,
And a more manly and wiser man
Than he is by far, deny it who can!
And, in conclusion, I'd have him to beware,
And never again to interfere with a poet's hair,
Because Christ the Saviour wore long hair,
And many more good men, I do declare.
Therefore I laugh at such bosh that appears in print.
So I hope from me you will take the hint,
And never publish such bosh of poetry again,
Or else you'll get the famous Weekly News a bad name."
724,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsBeautifulWorldPoembyVanessaBrown,"Young lovers entwined on the grass
On a beautiful hot summer's day;
Weary new parents breaking into a smile
As they watch their kids giggle and play.
The excited shriek of a bubbling child
As Christmas Day dawns clear;
Old grannies bumbling and grumbling
About all those 'prices so dear! '
The peaceful look on a wrinkled man's face
As he reminisces on times gone past;
The perfect layer of untrodden snow
And the prisms of light that it casts.
The purpley orange setting sun -
Sure to rise pure and bright in the morn;
The cloudless night sky, embedded with stars
That will last from dusk until dawn.
The crystalline tears of a beautiful girl
On receiving a much adored gift;
An undisturbed lake, a shimmering blue,
With only pure white swans adrift.
The flight of confetti that sways in the wind
As the cheerful wedding bells chime;
The gleeful mirth of the poetry fan
When a poet contrives a bad rhyme!
The delicious intensity leading up
To a newly found couple's first kiss;
An unsure child beaming, fully content
Due to a compliment not gone amiss.
The merrily burning, friendly log fire,
By which a tired cat has curled;
I truly believe, and i tell you all now -
We live in a beautiful world!"
725,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsLizPhairAndThreeBeautifulLadiesPoembyUriahHamilton,"On a warm sultry night last August,
I went to a rock concert featuring Liz Phair
And several other female artists.
A male friend of mine couldn’t go with me,
But I didn’t really mind, I love music so much
That I never want to talk or think about anything but the show.
Once I was there, though, I ran into three female friends:
Erica, Diana, and Soha!
I was as nearly as exited to see them as Liz;
If I had been a puppy,
My little tail would have been
Ecstatically wagging!
I was in the front row and toward the end of the show,
I reached my hand toward Liz Phair wanting
To slightly touch her, but she placed a guitar pick
Into my outstretched hand, I thought I might have a heart attack!
My three friends were cheering me on like perfect angels!
When the show was over, I walked out with my three friends.
The concert was promoted by a makeup company,
And they were giving out free packets of makeup.
My three friends, all beautiful ladies, took one;
Being right on their heels, I also took one.
The woman handing out the makeup gave me a peculiar look,
But I never thought about it, but Erica, being the most wonderfully
Outspoken and lovely woman, asked me almost accusingly,
“Are you going to use that, Uriah? ” Innocently I replied,
“What is it? ” Soha joined in, “Eyeliner. Can I have it? ”
I had never used eyeliner before and had no real intentions to start,
So I was quite happy to give it to Soha!
But on the way home from the show I thought,
I’m glad they weren’t giving out tampons,
I probably would have taken a handful of those, too!"

Beautiful was never ever created by mistake
Beautiful is the ingredient we bake life's cake

727,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsBeautifulNairnPoembyWilliamTopazMcGonagall,"All ye tourists who wish to be away
From the crowded city for a brief holiday;
The town of Nairn is worth a visit, I do confess,
And it's only about fifteen miles from Inverness.
And in the summer season it's a very popular bathing-place,
And the visitors from London and Edinburgh finds solace,
As they walk along the yellow sand beach inhaling fresh air;
Besides, there's every accommodation for ladies and gentlemen there.
Then there's a large number of bathing coaches there,
And the climate is salubrious, and very warm the air;
And every convenience is within the bathers' reach,
Besides, there's very beautiful walks by the sea beach.
The visitors to Nairn can pass away the time agreeably,
By viewing Tarbetness, which slopes downwards to the sea;
And Queen Street is one of the prettiest thoroughfares,
Because there's splendid shops in it, and stocked with different wares.
And there's ornamental grounds, and lovely shady nooks,
Which is a great advantage to visitors while reading their books;
And there's a certain place known as the Ladies' Beach,
So private that no intruder can them reach.
And there's many neat cottages with gardens very nice,
And picturesque villas, which can be rented at a reasonable price;
Besides, there's a golf course for those that such a game seeks,
Which would prove a great attraction to the knights of clubs and cleeks.
The surrounding scenery of Nairn is magnificent to be seen,
Especially its fertile fields and woodlands so green;
Besides, not far from Nairn, there's Cawdor Castle, the ancient seat
Of the noble Thanes of Cawdor, with its bold turrets so neat.
And its massive proportions is very imposing to see,
Because the arched entrance is secured by a drawbridge and a fosse;
And visitors will be allowed all over the grounds to roam,
Besides shown over the castle if the Earl is not at home.
The scenery surrounding the castle is charming in the summertime,
And the apples in the orchard there is very fine,
Also the flower-beds are most beautiful to see,
Especially in the month of June, when the birds sing merrily.
Then there's the ancient stronghold of the Bays of Lochloy,
And visitors when they see it will it heartily enjoy;
And a little further on there's the blasted heath of Macbeth,
And a hillock where the witches are wont to dance till out of breath.
And as the visitors to Nairn walk along the yellow sand,
They can see, right across the Moray Firth, the Black Island so grand,
With its productive fields and romantic scenery,
And as the tourist gazes thereon his heart fills with ecstasy.
And Darnaway Castle is well worthy of praise,
And to oblige all visitors there are open days,
When they can see the castle where one thousand warriors in all
Oft have assembled in the Earl of Randolph's Hall.
And in conclusion I will say for good bathing Nairn is the best,
And besides its pleasant scenery is of historical interest;
And the climate gives health to many visitors while there,
Therefore I would recommend Nairn for balmy pure air."

For amber waves of grain,
For purple mountain majesties

730,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsBeautifulEdinburghPoembyWilliamTopazMcGonagall,"Beautiful city of Edinburgh, most wonderful to be seen,
With your ancient palace of Holyrood and Queen's Park Green,
And your big, magnificent, elegant New College,
Where people from all nations can be taught knowledge.
The New College of Edinburgh is certainly very grand
Which I consider to be an honour to fair Scotland,
Because it's the biggest in the world, without any doubt,
And is most beautiful in the inside as well as out.
And the Castle is wonderful to look upon,
Which has withstood many angry tempests in years bygone;
And the rock it's built upon is rugged and lovely to be seen
When the shrubberies surrounding it are blown full green.
Morningside is lovely and charming to be seen;
The gardens there are rich with flowers and shrubberies green
And sweet scented perfumes fill the air,
Emanating from the sweet flowers and beautiful plants there.
And as for Braidhill, it's a very romantic spot,
But a fine place to visit when the weather is hot;
There the air is nice and cool, which will help to drive away sorrow
When ye view from its summit the beautiful city of Edinburgh.
And as for the statues, they are very grand-
They cannot be surpassed in any foreign land;
And the scenery is attractive and fascinating to the eye,
And arrests the attention of tourists as they pass by.
Lord Melville's Monument is most elegant to be seen,
Which is situated in St. Andrew's Square, amongst shrubberies green,
Which seems most gorgeous to the eye,
Because it is towering so very high.
The Prince Albert Consort Statue looks very grand,
Especially the granite blocks whereon it doth stand,
Which is admired by all tourists as they pass by,
Because the big granite blocks seem magnificent to the eye.
Princes Street West End Garden Is fascinating to be seen,
With its beautiful big trees and shrubberies green,
And its magnificent water fountain in the valley below
Helps to drive away from the tourist all care and woe.
The Castle Hotel is elegant and grand,
And students visit it from every foreign land,
And the students of Edinburgh often call there
To rest and have luncheon, at a very cheap fare.
Queen Street Garden seems charming to the eye,
And a great boon it is to the tenantry near by,
As they walk along the grand gravel walks near there,
Amongst the big trees and shrubberies, and inhale pure air.
Then, all ye tourists, be advised by me,
Beautiful Edinburgh ye ought to go and see.
It's the only city I know of where ye can wile away the time
By viewing its lovely scenery and statues fine.
Magnificent city of Edinburgh, I must conclude my muse,
But to write in praise of thee I cannot refuse.
I will tell the world boldly without dismay
You have the biggest college in the world at the present day.
Of all the cities in the world, Edinburgh for me;
For no matter where I look, some lovely spot I see;
And for picturesque scenery unrivalled you do stand.
Therefore I pronounce you to be the Pride of Fair Scotland."

about you."
732,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsBeautifulNorthBerwickPoembyWilliamTopazMcGonagall,"North Berwick is a watering-place with golfing links green,
With a fine bathing beach most lovely to be seen;
And there's a large number of handsome villas also,
And often it's called the Scarborough of Scotland, as Portobello.
The greatest attraction is Tantallon Castle, worthy of regard,
About three miles distant to the eastward;
Which in time of war reoeived many a shock,
And it's deemed impregnable and built on a perpendicular rock
The castle was built in times unknown to history,
But 'tis said it belonged to the Douglas family;
And the inside is a labyrinth of broken staircases,
Also ruined chambers and many dismal places.
Then there's the Berwick Law Hill, 612 feet high,
Which no doubt is very attractive to the eye,
And skirted with a wood and a public walk,
Where visitors can enjoy themselves and have a social talk.
The wood is really lovely and enchanting to be seen,
In the spring or summer season when the trees are green;
And as ye listen to the innocent birds singing merrily there,
'Twill help to elevate your spirits and drive away dull care.
Then near by Tantallon is the fishing village of Canty Bay,
Where boats can be hired to the Bass Rock, about two miles away;
And the surrounding scenery is magnificent to see,
And as the tourists view the scene it fills their hearts with glee.
Then away! then away! pleasure-seekers in bands,
And view Gullane with its beautiful sands,
Which stretch along the sandy shores of Fife,
Where the tourist can enjoy himself and be free from strife."
733,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsBecauseYouReBeautifulPoembyDavidTaylor,"Because you’re Beautiful
This poem’s addressed
To you
Because you’re beautiful
No matter what
You do
Because you’re beautiful
The sun rises
Every day
Because you’re beautiful
The mist shrouds a
Dreamy day
Because you’re beautiful
A blossom blooms and holds
Its scent
Because you’re beautiful
Songs sung in your heart
Are meant
Because you’re beautiful
Reflections shine
And glint
Because you’re beautiful
Poems are written
Heaven sent
Because you are beautiful
This is all that this
Poem’s said
Just in case you may have
Any doubt
This poem's heaven sent
To tell you
You are beautiful
And that is what this poem
Is about."
734,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsABeautifulDayPoembyCharlesMMoore,"I walked to the cliff top to watch the sunset
thinking of you and the time that we met
I watched as the sun drifted down from the sky
a reminding reflection of light in your eyes
A myriad birds flocked from over the hill
returning to roost as the world stood still
their fawning and waving high up in the air
brought memories to me how you unfurl your hair
The sea seemed to amble as if in a trance
when reaching the rocks leaping into a dance
its light sparking rainbows in fine misty haze
a lasting encounter of how we embrace
The sun kissed the horizon like I kiss your lips
it was saying goodnight with its light fingertips
caressing the ocean and stretching my way
a beautiful end to a beautiful day."
735,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsBeautifulBeautifulBeautifulPoembyGajananMishra,"Really beautiful,
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful,
Nothing but beautiful.
Your eyes, Your hand-less hand,

Without any presentation.
Really beautiful, and one who

Is really a fool and see
That fool himself is also beautiful."

The ones I’ll never give up.
I love you more than the perfect field,
The one I use to warm up.
I love you more than my soccer ball,
The one that’s perfect for amazing passes.
I love you more than me running along those different types of grasses.
I love you more than the cheering crowds,
The stands made out of plaster.
I love you more than that perfect kick,
That I have yet to master.
I love you more than my soccer cleats the ones that hold all reason.
I love you more than my coach, my soccer team and my season.
I love you more than winning that world cup,
That we have yet to reclaim.
I can’t believe I love you more than the beautiful game."

738,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsTheBeautifulBlueDanubePoembyEllaWheelerWilcox,"They drift down the hall together;
He smiles in her lifted eyes.
Like waves of that mighty river
The strains of the ‘Danube’ rise.
They float on its rhythmic measure,
Like leaves on a summer stream;
And here, in this scene of pleasure,
I bury my sweet dead dream.
Through the cloud of her dusky tresses,
Like a star, shines out her face;
And the form of his strong arm presses
Is sylph-like in its grace.
As a leaf on the bounding river
Is lost in the seething sea,
I know that for ever and ever
My dream is lost to me.
And still the viols are playing
That grand old wordless rhyme;
And still those two are swaying
In perfect tune and time.
If the great bassoons that mutter,
If the clarinets that blow,
Were given the chance to utter
The secret things they know.
Would the lists of the slain who slumber
On the Danube’s battle-plains
The unknown hosts outnumber
Who die ‘neath the ‘Danube’s’ strains?
Those fall where the cannons rattle,
‘Mid the rain of shot and shell;
But these, in a fiercer battle,
Find death in the music’s swell.
With the river’s roar of passion
Is blended the dying groan;
But here, in the halls of fashion,
Hearts break, and make no moan.
And the music, swelling and sweeping,
Like the river, knows it all;
But none are counting or keeping
The lists of those who fall."
739,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsMyBeautifulChildrenPoembyRaeChristensen,"I have two beautiful children
Was it excellent? A daughter and a son
The chubby twelve yrs old is Pim
The younger 9 is a bit slim, Pete is the other one
Pim is a lovely funny girl
Her hair is a bit curly curl, she said like her mom
She loves to go to school
And she is very cool, telling me she wants to drum
She has a lot of good friends
Like a choo choo train, her friends at school
B, Manao, Fon, Puen, Tob, Deer and Dae
It’s enough for today, they all are wonderful
Pim is a big fan of MTV
I always see she listens to the song
When she’s home, she turns Television on
MTV of course, cos she loves to sing along
She likes to do some art works
Painting, drawing the bird, folding some origami
Making me lots of beautiful card
Coming straight from her heart, they’re very pretty
Oh dear, saying a lot about Pim
Pete loves to swim and he likes to play
He stays with Ed his father
He has a little brother from his stepmother A
Japanese super heroes he likes
The ones with the light, he loves the most
V 8 I chose for his birthday present
When he turned to 7, n I also gave him some clothes
Pete is a very sweet boy
He keeps his toys very nice on the shelf
He does not look like his sister
But looks like his mother, he’s charming by himself
I love very much my two kids
I try to be strict for their good manners
I hope to see both of them grow
Hoping time pass a bit slow, they can make me pleasure
I have to end my poem right now
I hope they both proud having me as their mother
Teaching them for me is difficult some time
Getting help from Khun Ta Khun Yai, as they called my mother & father"

The roses of June

So I can give them to my girl
She could shame any wonder
No doubt them all

743,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsBeautifulOldAgePoembyDavidHerbertLawrence,"It ought to be lovely to be old
to be full of the peace that comes of experience
and wrinkled ripe fulfilment.
The wrinkled smile of completeness that follows a life
lived undaunted and unsoured with accepted lies
they would ripen like apples, and be scented like pippins
in their old age.
Soothing, old people should be, like apples
when one is tired of love.
Fragrant like yellowing leaves, and dim with the soft
stillness and satisfaction of autumn.
And a girl should say:
It must be wonderful to live and grow old.
Look at my mother, how rich and still she is! -
And a young man should think: By Jove
my father has faced all weathers, but it's been a life!"
744,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsSonnet10YetLoveMereLoveIsBeautifulIndeedPoembyElizabethBarrettBrowning,"X
Yet, love, mere love, is beautiful indeed
And worthy of acceptation. Fire is bright,
Let temple burn, or flax; an equal light
Leaps in the flame from cedar-plank or weed:
And love is fire. And when I say at need
I love thee . . . mark! . . . I love thee—in thy sight
I stand transfigured, glorified aright,
With conscience of the new rays that proceed
Out of my face toward thine. There's nothing low
In love, when love the lowest: meanest creatures
Who love God, God accepts while loving so.
And what I feel, across the inferior features
Of what I am, doth flash itself, and show
How that great work of Love enhances Nature's."

My father upon the Abbey stage, before him a raging crowd:
'This Land of Saints,' and then as the applause died out,
'Of plaster Saints'; his beautiful mischievous head thrown back.
Standish O'Grady supporting himself between the tables
Speaking to a drunken audience high nonsensical words;
Augusta Gregory seated at her great ormolu table,
Her eightieth winter approaching:  'Yesterday he threatened my life.
I told him that nightly from six to seven I sat at this table,
The blinds drawn up'; Maud Gonne at Howth station waiting a train,
Pallas Athene in that straight back and arrogant head:
All the Olympians; a thing never known again."

747,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsWearyNotOfUsForWeAreVeryBeautifulPoembyMewlanaJalaluddinRumi,"Weary not of us, for we are very beautiful; it is out of very jealousy and proper pride that we entered the veil.
On the day when we cast of the body’s veil from the soul, you will see that we are the envy of despair of man and the Polestars.
Wash your face and become clean for beholding us, else remain afar, for we are beloveds of ourselves.
We are not that beauty who tomorrow will become a crone; till eternity we are young and heart-comforting and fair of stature.
If that veil become worn out, the beauty has not grown old; the life of the Veil is transient, and we are boundless life.
When Eblis saw the veil of Adam, he refused; Adam called to him, “You are the rejected one, not I.”
The rest of the angels fell down prostrate, saying as they bowed themselves, “We have encountered a beauty:
“Beneath the veil is an idol who by his qualities robbed us of reason, and we, prostrate, fell.”
If our reason does not know the forms of the foul old men from those of the beauties, we are apostates from love.
What place is there for a beauty? For he is the Lion of God. Like a child we prattled, for we are children of the alphabet.
Children are beguiled with nuts and raisins, else, how are we meet for nuts and sesame-grains?
When an old woman is hidden in helmet and chainmail, she says, “I am the illustrious Rostam of the battle ranks.”
By her boast all know that she is a woman; how should we make a mistake, seeing that we are in the light of Ahmad?
“The believer is discriminating” - so said the Prophet; now close your mouth, for we are guided rightly without speech.
Hear the rest of from Shams the Pride of Tabiz for we did not take the end of the story from that king."
748,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsABeautifulYoungNymphGoingToBedPoembyJonathanSwift,"Corinna, Pride of Drury-Lane,
For whom no Shepherd sighs in vain;
Never did Covent Garden boast
So bright a batter'd, strolling Toast;
No drunken Rake to pick her up,
No Cellar where on Tick to sup;
Returning at the Midnight Hour;
Four Stories climbing to her Bow'r;
Then, seated on a three-legg'd Chair,
Takes off her artificial Hair:
Now, picking out a Crystal Eye,
She wipes it clean, and lays it by.
Her Eye-Brows from a Mouse's Hide,
Stuck on with Art on either Side,
Pulls off with Care, and first displays 'em,
Then in a Play-Book smoothly lays 'em.
Now dextrously her Plumpers draws,
That serve to fill her hollow Jaws.
Untwists a Wire; and from her Gums
A Set of Teeth completely comes.
Pulls out the Rags contriv'd to prop
Her flabby Dugs and down they drop.
Proceeding on, the lovely Goddess
Unlaces next her Steel-Rib'd Bodice;
Which by the Operator's Skill,
Press down the Lumps, the Hollows fill,
Up hoes her Hand, and off she slips
The Bolsters that supply her Hips.
With gentlest Touch, she next explores
Her Shankers, Issues, running Sores,
Effects of many a sad Disaster;
And then to each applies a Plaster.
But must, before she goes to Bed,
Rub off the Daubs of White and Red;
And smooth the Furrows in her Front,
With greasy Paper stuck upon't.
She takes a Bolus e'er she sleeps;
And then between two Blankets creeps.
With pains of love tormented lies;
Or if she chance to close her Eyes,
Of Bridewell and the Compter dreams,
And feels the Lash, and faintly screams;
Or, by a faithless Bully drawn,
At some Hedge-Tavern lies in Pawn;
Or to Jamaica seems transported,
Alone, and by no Planter courted;
Or, near Fleet-Ditch's oozy Brinks,
Surrounded with a Hundred Stinks,
Belated, seems on watch to lie,
And snap some Cull passing by;
Or, struck with Fear, her Fancy runs
On Watchmen, Constables and Duns,
From whom she meets with frequent Rubs;
But, never from Religious Clubs;
Whose Favour she is sure to find,
Because she pays them all in Kind.
CORINNA wakes. A dreadful Sight!
Behold the Ruins of the Night!
A wicked Rat her Plaster stole,
Half eat, and dragged it to his Hole.
The Crystal Eye, alas, was miss'd;
And Puss had on her Plumpers piss'd.
A Pigeon pick'd her Issue-Peas;
And Shock her Tresses fill'd with Fleas.
The Nymph, tho' in this mangled Plight,
Must ev'ry Morn her Limbs unite.
But how shall I describe her Arts
To recollect the scatter'd Parts?
Or show the Anguish, Toil, and Pain,
Of gath'ring up herself again?
The bashful Muse will never bear
In such a Scene to interfere.
Corinna in the Morning dizen'd,
Who sees, will spew; who smells, be poison'd.

Bright with the sunshine and glows in the sky.
Birdies are singing and dewdrops are falling:
It's a beautiful morning outside.
Day after day in this wonderful way,
Nature is showing its wonderful face,
With sunshine at mornings, and cheers every where;
It is morning again in this world.
I was eager in heaven to go on a stroll;
It was mother who who showed me this wonderful world,
With radiance and sunshine and glory to all;
I forgot the heavens the place of my soul.
Now that I am grown up a man in this world,
I will sing to the glory of God's given love.
I will look to the sunshine for youth and for joy,
For sunshine brings morning to all."

Shall we gather at the river
Where bright angel feet have trod;
With its crystal tide forever
Flowing by the throne of God?
CHORUS.
Yes, we'll gather at the river,
The beautiful, the beautiful river --
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows by the throne of God.
On the margin of the river,
Washing up its silver spray,
We will walk and worship ever,
All the happy, golden day.
Yes, we'll gather at the river,
The beautiful, the beautiful river --
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows by the throne of God.
On the bosom of the river,
Where the Saviour-king we own,
We shall meet, and sorrow never
'Neath the glory of the throne. Cho.
Yes, we'll gather at the river,
The beautiful, the beautiful river --
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows by the throne of God.
Ere we reach the shining river,
Lay we every burden down;
Grace our spirits will deliver,
And provide a robe and crown. Cho.
Yes, we'll gather at the river,
The beautiful, the beautiful river --
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows by the throne of God.
At the smiling of the river,
Rippling with the Saviour's face,
Saints, whom death will never sever,
Lift their songs of saving grace. Cho.
Yes, we'll gather at the river,
The beautiful, the beautiful river --
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows by the throne of God.
Soon we'll reach the shining river,
Soon our pilgrimage will cease,
Soon our happy hearts will quiver
With the melody of peace. Cho.
Yes, we'll gather at the river,
The beautiful, the beautiful river --
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows by the throne of God."

I was a little girl with curvaceous hips, and thighs.
I was perfect in size.

Fat hips and thighs.
Only a love saw the good in what I despised.
Then a look back, showed all the beauty in me.
I‘ve grown into a

I have full breast, hips and thighs.
I’m a voluptuous full figured woman.
I’m beautiful, strong, intelligent, and independent.
I’ve brought beauty to the world.
I ‘m proud and not ashamed
I shall not apologize for who I’ve become.
I’m a sexy brown thick sista (sister) .
Finer than the rarest bottle of wine

754,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsBeautifulMonikiePoembyWilliamTopazMcGonagall,"Beautiful Monikie! with your trees and shrubberies green
And your beautiful walks, most charming to be seen:
'Tis a beautiful place for pleasure-seekers to resort,
Because there they can have innocent sport,
taking a leisure walk all round about,
And see the ang1ers fishing in the pand for trout.
Besides, there's lovely white swans swimming on the pond,
And Panmure Monument can be seen a little distance beyond;
And the scenery all round is enchanting I declare,
While sweet-scented fragrance fills the air.
Then away, pleasure-seekers of bonnie Dundee,
And have a day's outing around Monikie,
And inhale the pure air, on a fine summer day,
Which will help to drive dull care away;
As ye gaze on the beautiful scenery there,
Your spirits will feel o'erjoyed and free frozen care.
Then near to the pond there's a beautiful green sward,
Where excursionists can dance until fatigue does them retard;
And if they feel thirsty, the Monikie water's near by,
Where they can quench their thirst if very dry.
Then, after that, they can have a walk at their ease,
Amongst the green shrubbery and tall pine trees;
And in the centre of the pand they can see
Three beautiful little islets dressed in green livery.
Monikie is as bonnie a place as ye could wish to see,
And about eleven or twelve miles from bonnie Dundee;
It's the only place I know of to enjoy a holiday,
Because there's a hall of shelter there to keep the rain away.
Then there's a large park, a very suitable place,
For the old and the young, if they wish to try a race;
It's there they can enjoy themselves during the live-long summmer day,
Near to the little purling burn, meandering on its way,
And emptying itself into the pond of Monikie,
Which supplies the people with water belonging to Dundee."
755,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsLifeIsBeautifulPoembyOldAmsterdam,"If you choose it, no one can get any...but lose a lot
When a flower was faded
You needn't to die
When the sun was down
You needn't to die
So why you want to choose another way to live?
You don't know that world is perfect or evil!
When you die
You can't see another beautiful flower in bloom
When you die
You can't see the red hot sun's out
Yes, you can't see it~because you die
No one wants to abandon you
And god loves you too
But  all of this
It's you abandon yourself
you thought that death can remove all of your pain.
But you don't understand
The biggest misery is live in beauty but you don't know it!
Before your mind controled by devil
Before you come to another world with 'Hello'
Think about
Life is beautiful"

All creatures great and small,
All things wise and wonderful,
The Lord God made them all.
Each little flower that opens,
Each little bird that sings,
He made their glowing colours,
He made their tiny wings.
The rich man in his castle,
The poor man at his gate,
God made them, high or lowly,
And ordered their estate.
The purple-headed mountain,
The river running by,
The sunset, and the morning,
That brightens up the sky;
The cold wind in the winter,
The pleasant summer sun,
The ripe fruits in the garden,
He made them every one.
The tall trees in the greenwood,
The meadows where we play,
The rushes by the water,
We gather every day;--
He gave us eyes to see them,
And lips that we might tell,
How great is God Almighty,
Who has made all things well."

Sweet harmony do they make.
A lonesome world this would be,

these wonderful creatures I see.
Beautiful birds of nature
wonderful sounds to my ear
touching me with wonder,
so gentle with serenity

758,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsOnABeautifulLandscapePoembyWilliamLisleBowles,"Beautiful landscape! I could look on thee
For hours,--unmindful of the storm and strife,
And mingled murmurs of tumultuous life.
Here, all is still as fair--the stream, the tree,
The wood, the sunshine on the bank: no tear
No thought of time's swift wing, or closing night
Which comes to steal away the long sweet light,
No sighs of sad humanity are here.
Here is no tint of mortal change--the day
Beneath whose light the dog and peasant-boy
Gambol with look, and almost bark, of joy--
Still seems, though centuries have passed, to stay.
Then gaze again, that shadowed scenes may teach
Lessons of peace and love, beyond all speech."
759,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsBeautifulCriefPoembyWilliamTopazMcGonagall,"Ye lovers of the picturesque, if ye wish to drown your grief,
Take my advice, and visit the ancient town of Crieff;
The climate is bracing, and the walks lovely to see.
Besides, ye can ramble over the district, and view the beautiful scenery.
The town is admirably situated from the cold winter winds,
And the visitors, during their stay there, great comfort finds,
Because there is boating and fishing, and admission free,
Therefore they can enjoy themselves right merrily.
There is also golf courses, tennis greens, and good roads,
Which will make the travelling easier to tourists with great loads,
And which will make the bicyclists' hearts feel gay,
Because they have everything there to make an enjoyable holiday.
The principal river there is the Earn, rolling on its way,
And which flows from Loch Earn, and joins the silvery Tay
Above Newburgh, after a course of more than thirty miles;
And as the tourist views the scene with joy he smiles.
The princely domain of Drummond Castle is most beautiful to be seen,
Especially when the woody landscape is blown full green,
And from the entrance gate to the castle an avenue extends all the way,
And to view the branches of the frees interlacing makes the heart feel gay.
Drummond Castle's flowery gardens are really very grand;
They cannot be surpassed in Great Britain,
And in the summer-time the bee and the butterfly are there on the wing,
And with the carolling of birds the gardens doth ring.
And from Knock Hill on the north and west,
The view from its summit is considered the best;
Because the Grampians and the Ochils can be seen,
While the beautiful rich fertile valley lies between.
And there are many seats where the weary traveller can rest,
And there is also a fountain of water, the very best,
While visitors can drink of while resting there,
And gaze on the magnificent scenery and inhale the pure air.
Then there's Lady Mary's Walk near the Bridge of Turret,
Which I hope visitors will go and see and not forget,
Because near by grows a magnificent oak most lovely to see,
Which is known by the name of Eppie Callum's Tree.
And at each end of this walk the visitors can ascend Laggan Hill,
And as they view the woods and fields with joy their hearts
And they will find seats plenteous on this elevated bower,
On which they may rest and wile away the hour.
The Hydropathic is situated on an eminence most grand,
And is one of the largest buildings in fair Scotland;
And capable of accommodating five hundred visitors, who often call there,
To recuperate their health and breathe the fragrant air.
Then there's Abercairny, which is most beautiful to view,
And Her Majesty the Queen visited the grounds in 1842;
And the park and the trees has the aspect of a southern scene,
And the lovely appearance of it gladdened the heart of our Queen.
Then there's the village of Foulis, which tourists ought to see,
Because the scenery there is charming and pretty;
And there's a sycamore tree there that was planted 300 years ago,
And I'm sure the sight thereof will please both high and low.
Therefore, in conclusion, to all lovers of the beautiful I will say,
If ye really wish to spend an enjoyable holiday,
I would recommend Crieff for lovely scenery and pure air;
Besides, the climate gives health to many visitors during their stay there."
760,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsBeautifulPoembyhenrikwetter,"The grass is green
I can be seen,
I am so mean
That's why I'm mean
Look at me
I'm full of glee,
I love the sea
like a buzzy bee
I love you too
That's what I do,
I go to the zoo
To see you!"
761,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsTheBeautifulBeeshareenBoyPoembyMathildeBlind,"Beautiful, black-eyed boy,
O lithe-limbed Beeshareen!
Face that finds no maid coy,
Page for some peerless queen:
Some Orient queen of old,
Sumptuous in woven gold,
Close-clinging fold on fold,
Lightning, with gems between.
Bred in the desert, where
Only to breathe and be
Alive in living air
Is finest ecstasy;
Where just to ride or rove,
With sun or stars above,
Intoxicates like love,
When love shall come to thee.
Thy lovely limbs are bare;
Only a rag, in haste,
Draped with a princely air,
Girdles they slender waist.
And gaudy beads and charms,
Dangling from neck and arms,
Ward off dread spells and harms
Of Efreets of the waste.
Caressed of wind and sun,
Across the white-walled town
Fawnlike we saw thee run,
Light Love in Mocha brown!
Wild Cupid, without wings,
Twanging thy viol strings;
With crocodiles and rings
Bartered for half a crown.
Spoilt darling of our bark,
Smiling with teeth as white
As when across the dark
There breaks a flash of light.
And what a careless grace
Showed in thy gait and pace;
Eyes starlike in a face
Sweet as a Nubian night!
Better than Felt or Fez,
High on thy forehead set,
Countless in lock and tress,
Waved a wild mane of jet.
Kings well might envy thee
What courts but rarely see,
Curls of rich ebony
Coiled in a coronet.
Lo--in dim days long since--
The strolling Almehs tell,
Thou shouldst have been a prince,
Boy of the ebon fell!
If truth the poet sings,
Thy tribe, oh Beduin, springs
From those lost tribes of Kings,
Once Kings in Israel.
Ah me! the camp-fires gleam
Out yonder, where the sands
Fade like a lotos dream
In hollow twilight lands.
Our sail swells to the blast,
Our boat speeds far and fast,
Farewell! And to the last
Smile, waving friendly hands.
* * * * * *
From England's storm-girt isle,
O'er seas where seagulls wail,
Rocked on the rippling Nile,
We drift with drooping sail.
On waters hushed at night,
Where stars of Egypt write
In hieroglyphs of light
Their undeciphered tale.
Forlorn sits Assouan;
Where is her boy, her pride?--
Now in the lamplit Khan,
Now by the riverside,
Or where the Soudanese,
Under mimosa trees,
Chaunt mournful melodies,
We've sought him far and wide.
Oh, desert-nurtured Child,
How dared they carry thee,
Far from thy native Wild,
Across the Western Sea?
Packed off, poor boy, at last,
With many a plaster cast
Of plinth and pillar vast,
And waxen mummies piled!
Ah! just like other ware,
For a lump sum or so
Shipped to the World's great Fair--
To big Chicago Show!
With mythic beasts and things,
Beetles and bulls with wings,
And imitation Sphinx,
Ranged row on curious row!
Beautiful, black-eyed boy;
Ah me! how strange it is
That thou, the desert's joy,
Whom heavenly winds would kiss,
With Ching and Chang-hwa ware,
Blue pots and bronzes rare,
Shouldst now be over there
Shown at Porkopolis.
Gone like a lovely dream,
Child of the starry smile;
Gone from the glowing stream
Glassing its greenest isle!
We've sought, but sought in vain;
Thou wilt not come again,
Never for bliss or pain,
Home to thy orphaned Nile."
762,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsTheBeautifulChangesPoembyRichardWilbur,"One wading a Fall meadow finds on all sides
The Queen Anne's Lace lying like lilies
On water; it glides
So from the walker, it turns
Dry grass to a lake, as the slightest shade of you
Valleys my mind in fabulous blue Lucernes.
The beautiful changes as a forest is changed
By a chameleon's tuning his skin to it;
As a mantis, arranged
On a green leaf, grows
Into it, makes the leaf leafier, and proves
Any greenness is greener than anyone knows.
Your hands hold roses always in a way that says
They are not only yours; the beautiful changes
In such kind ways,
Wishing ever to sunder
Things and Thing's selves for a second finding, to lose
For a moment all that it touches back to wonder."
763,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsYouAreTheBeautifulOnePoembyUriahHamilton,"Walk straight into the blissful arms
Of a new day,
Create an invigorating mindset
And devote your dreams
To an exquisite fate.
Be conscientious in following paths
Of illumination and self-realization:
Every moment is the death
Of a disappointing past
With the reassuring promise of rebirth.
Discover the immensity of your self-worth:
Unseen gods and goddesses
Are awaiting your arrival;
Deities in secret galaxies
Offer incense for your survival
And compose verses for your soul’s protection."
764,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsThinkingAboutBeautifulDreamPoembyBHUPINDERINDER,"If I am not in your life, do not mind
However, I will come in your dreams every night
Every night I will come and sit, in front of you
Touching you and feeling your soft breaths
Hold your hand and looking into your lake eyes
You are singing and I am listening your sweet voice
My head on your sky laps
You rolling your fingers into my hairs
You dropping your love on me as a rain
Moreover, I play with like a little kid games
And the time is come.......
The moon completed his journey
Stars are going his home
We waked up and came out of the dreams
Here we saw beautiful morning scene
Sun is red and bright birds are singing
Cold polite wind flow, flowers are laughing
Moreover, we both are thinking
About this beautiful dream"
765,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsBeautifulBalmoralPoembyWilliamTopazMcGonagall,"Ye lovers of the picturesque, away and see
Beautiful Balmoral, near by the River Dee;
There ye will see the deer browsing on the heathery hills,
While adown their sides run clear sparkling rills.
Which the traveller can drink of when he feels dry,
And admire the dark River Dee near by,
Rolling smoothly and silently on its way,
Which is most lovely to see on a summer day.
There the trout do sport and play
During the live-long summer day;
Also plenty of salmon are there to be seen,
Glittering like silver in the sun's sheen.
And the mountains are rugged and wild to be seen,
But the woodlands are beautiful when Nature's face is green;
There numerous rabbits do gambol all day
Amongst the green scrubbery all lively and gay.
There's one charming spot most magnificent to be seen,
'Tis Balmoral Castle, the Highland Home of our Queen;
The surrounding scenery is enchanting to see,
While near by rolls past the lovely River Dee.
Therefore, ye lovers of the picturesque, away and see
Beautiful Balmoral Castle and its grand scenery,
And the sight will fill your hearts with glee,
As ye walk along the bonnie banks o' the River Dee."
766,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsBeautifulComriePoembyWilliamTopazMcGonagall,"Ye lovers of the picturesque, away, away!
To beautiful Comrie and have a holiday;
Aud bask in the sunahine and inhale the fragrant air
Emanating from the woodlands and shrubberies there.
The charming village of Comrie is most lovely to be seen,
Especially in the summer season when the trees are green;
And near by is Loch Earn and its waters sparkling clear,
And as the tourist gazes thereon his spirits it will cheer.
Then St. Fillans is a beautiful spot, I must confess,
It is really a picture of rural loveliness;
Because out of the quiet lake the river ripples merrily,
And all round are hills beautiful in shape and nothing uncomely.
The rocky knoll to the south is a most seductive place,
And in the hotel there visitors will find every solace;
And the flower-decked cottages are charming to see,
Also handsome villas suitable for visitors of high and low degree.
Then there's St. Fillan's Hill, a prehistoric fort,
And visitors while there to it should resort;
And to the tourist the best approach is from the west,
Because in climbing the hill his strength it will test.
And descending the hill as best one may,
The scene makes the tourist's heart feel gay;
And by the west side is reached a wooded deli,
And about two hundred yards from that there's St. Fillan's Well.
Oh, charming Comrie! I must conclude my lay,
And to write in praise of thee I virtually do say
That your lovely mountains and silver birches will drive dull care away:
Therefore lovers of the picturesque, away, away!
To beautiful Comrie end have a holidoy,
And I'm sure you will return with spirits, light and gay,
After viewing the Sylvan beauties and hoary beeches there,
Also pines, ferns, and beautiful oaks, I do declare."

The people in this nation,
Have kept for many years,

And may we ever keep it,
Through all the years to come.

770,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsOnThePortraitOfTwoBeautifulYoungPeoplePoembyGerardManleyHopkins,"A Brother and Sister
O I admire and sorrow! The heart’s eye grieves
Discovering you, dark tramplers, tyrant years.
A juice rides rich through bluebells, in vine leaves,
And beauty’s dearest veriest vein is tears.
Happy the father, mother of these! Too fast:
Not that, but thus far, all with frailty, blest
In one fair fall; but, for time’s aftercast,
Creatures all heft, hope, hazard, interest.
And are they thus? The fine, the fingering beams
Their young delightful hour do feature down
That fleeted else like day-dissolvèd dreams
Or ringlet-race on burling Barrow brown.
She leans on him with such contentment fond
As well the sister sits, would well the wife;
His looks, the soul’s own letters, see beyond,
Gaze on, and fall directly forth on life.
But ah, bright forelock, cluster that you are
Of favoured make and mind and health and youth,
Where lies your landmark, seamark, or soul’s star?
There’s none but truth can stead you. Christ is truth.
There ’s none but good can bé good, both for you
And what sways with you, maybe this sweet maid;
None good but God—a warning wavèd to
One once that was found wanting when Good weighed.
Man lives that list, that leaning in the will
No wisdom can forecast by gauge or guess,
The selfless self of self, most strange, most still,
Fast furled and all foredrawn to No or Yes.
Your feast of; that most in you earnest eye
May but call on your banes to more carouse.
Worst will the best. What worm was here, we cry,
To have havoc-pocked so, see, the hung-heavenward boughs?
Enough: corruption was the world’s first woe.
What need I strain my heart beyond my ken?
O but I bear my burning witness though
Against the wild and wanton work of men.

774,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsBeautifulTorquayPoembyWilliamTopazMcGonagall,"All ye lovers of the picturesque, away
To beautiful Torquay and spend a holiday
'Tis health for invalids for to go there
To view the beautiful scenery and inhale the fragrant air,
Especially in the winter and spring-time of the year,
When the weather is not too hot, but is balmy and clear.
Torquay lies in a very deep and well-sheltered spot,
And at first sight by strangers it won't be forgot;
'Tis said to be the mildest place in ah England,
And surrounded by lofty hills most beautiful and grand.
Twas here that William of Orange first touched English ground,
And as he viewed the beautiful spot his heart with joy did rebound;
And an obelisk marks the spot where he did stand,
And which for long will be remembered throughout England.
Torquay, with its pier and its diadem of white,
Is a moat beautiful and very dazzling sight,
With its white villas glittering on the sides of its green hills,
And as the tourist gases thereon with joy his heart fills.
The heights around Torquay are most beautiful to be seen,
Especially when the trees and shrubberies are green,
And to see the pretty houses under the cliff is a treat,
And the little town enclosed where two deep valleys meet.
There is also a fine bathing establishment near the pier,
Where the tourist can bathe without any fear;
And as the tourists there together doth stroll,
I advise them to visit a deep chasm called Daddy's Hole.
Then there's Bablicome, only two miles from Torquay,
Which will make the stranger's heart feel gay,
As he stands on the cliff four hundred feet above the sea,
Looking down,'tis sure to fill his heart with ecstasy.
The lodging-houses at Bablicome are magnificent to be seen,
And the accommodation there would suit either king or queen,
And there's some exquisite cottages embowered in the woodland,
And sloping down to the sea shore, is really very grand.
You do not wonder at Napoleon's exclamation
As he stood on the deck of the ""Bellerophon,"" in a fit of admiration,
When the vessel was lying to windbound,
He exclaimed - ""Oh, what a beautiful country!"" his joy was profound.
And as the tourist there in search of beautiful spots doth rove,
Let them not forget to enquire for Anstey's Cove,
And there they will see a beautiful beach of milky white,
And the sight will fill their hearts with delight.
Oh! beautiful Torquay, with your lovely scenery,
And your magnificent cottages sloping down to the sea,
You are the most charming spot in all England,
With your picturesque bay and villas most grand.
And, in conclusion, to tourists I will say,
Off! off to Torquay and make no delay,
For the scenery is magnificent, and salubrious the air,
And 'tis good for the health to reside there."

776,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsEverythingIsBeautifulAndCoolOnAFridayNightPoembyUriahHamilton,"If you see me roaming Woodward Avenue
Down by the Majestic Theater,
I’ll be humming a song and digging the homeless,
Taking in the delicious aroma of pizza
Baking in the storefront,
Gazing at the young women and men
Drinking beer at outdoor tables
As conversations filter from the bowling alley.
I’ll laugh my ass off if a fight breaks out,
Everything is beautiful and cool on a Friday night,
Even the paramedics and cops smile
As their sirens wail and flash,
An old man takes his cane and smacks another
And it is all divine hi jinks
That a fun-loving God condones.
This city has been in decline for some time,
Dirty buildings and streets that often seem
Like a lonely ghost town,
But I can find just enough life around the corner
From the college to make it all sparkle
With the excitement of music and poetry
Interwoven with the inexhaustive heartbeats of desire."
777,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsBeautifulVillageOfPenicuikPoembyWilliamTopazMcGonagall,"The village of Penicuik, with its neighbouring spinning mills,
Is most lovely to see, and the Pentland Hills;
And though of a barren appearance and some parts steep,
They are covered with fine pasture and sustain flocks of sheep.
There, tourists while there should take a good look,
By viewing the surrounding beauties of Penicuik;
About three miles south-west is the romantic locality
Of Newhall, which is most fascinating and charming to see.
Then about half a mile above Newhall the River Esk is seen,
Which sparkles like crystal in the sun's sheen;
And on the Esk there's a forking ridge forming a linn
Betwixt two birch trees, which makes a noisy din.
And on a rocky protuberance close by is Mary Stuart's bower
Where Scotland's ill-starred Queen spent many an hour,
Which is composed of turf and a nice round seat
Commanding a full view of the linn- the sight is quite a treat.
Then there's Habbie's Howe, where the beauties of summer grow,
Which cannot be excelled in Scotland for pastoral show;
Tis one of the most beautiful landscapes in fair Scotland,
For the scenery there is most charming and grand.
Then ye tourists to the village of Penicuik haste away,
And there spend the lovely summer day
By climbing the heathy, barren Pentland Hills,
And drink the pure water from their crystal rills."

Traverse the aisles of the vegetables.
No one seems happy plotting out
And paying for their sustenance,
But personally, I adore
Every bag of gorgeously orange carrots
And the lovely dark green broccoli.
And how divine to see Italian wine
Or recently baked apple pies,
Sometimes I can’t believe my eyes
To be in such a beautiful place!
In reverence I bow my head,
I can’t wait to go home and say my prayers
And break my bread."

Each has their own in essential nature
And in the actions they perform
Until the dissolution of their life
To leave beauty’s impressions in our hearts
Yesterdays beauty never leaves or departs.
Beauty is all around
Each and every place it may be found
As you look with open eyes
Upon the forms that nature makes
Then man seeks to imitate
Yearning to match that beauty all around.
Beauty if you cannot find
Beauty must be in mind
Beauty is in purity
Beauty of simplicity
Beauty runs right through and through
Beauty in me, and them, and you.
Beauty, beauteous, beautiful
Beauty in heaven
Beauty in fire
Beauty in earth
And finally beauty in a simple verse."

With eyes of an angel
But beautiful daughters I praise thee
Praise be onto mothers that raise thee
For when a child is born a sweet girl
Heaven itself is raised from hell
Beautiful daughters are the seeds of peace
Their instinctive love we need not decrease
Bearing along the humane fruit of compassion
The golden qualities of a cherished companion
Beautiful daughters I praise thee
Praise be onto thy mothers that raise thee

Where my love hath made her home,
And with silent footstep slowly
Through the darksome forest roam,
Luna breaks through oaks and bushes,
Zephyr hastes her steps to meet,
And the waving birch-tree blushes,
Scattering round her incense sweet.
Grateful are the cooling breezes
Of this beauteous summer night,
Here is felt the charm that pleases,
And that gives the soul delight.

In a little non-descript bar
Where the loneliness
Hung heavily in the air
Like cigarette smoke.
In nearly drunken conversation,
You said you were
Sadly obsessed
By girl named Erica
Who turned into
A mythical dream and disappeared
Like Daphne into a laurel tree.
And I felt
Like we were brothers
In a world of beautiful women
Who fly away
Like untamed exotic birds
Which men can never cage.
And the bartender
Turned up the radio:
“The trouble is,
That you’re in love
With someone else,
It should be me,
It should be me! ”*"

Through out the season it shower with beautiful nature

You feel that the heaven blesses you dearly
You feel that the greenery hug you tightly
You feel that the cool breeze touches you tenderly
You see that the water falls roll over violently
You see that the trees dance to the tune of wind smoothly
You hear that the birds sing nature choir happily
You watch that the animals walk freely
When the nature open its heart widely
It gives everyone a chance to be with nature closely.

And the wonderful wind is shaking the tree,
It walks on the water, and whirls the mills,
And talks to itself on the tops of the hills.
You friendly Earth! how far do you go,
With the wheat-fields that nod and the rivers that flow,
With cities and gardens, and cliffs, and isles,
And people upon you for thousands of miles?
Ah, you are so great, and I am so small,
I tremble to think of you, World, at all;
And yet, when I said my prayers to-day,
A whisper inside me seemed to say,
""You are more than the Earth, though you are such a dot:
You can love and think, and the Earth cannot!"""
794,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsNoOneUnderstandsHeartacheLikeABeautifulGirlPoembyMeaganPeters,"In a world of barbies, implants and a size 26 waist
heartache's no more prevalent than in her with a beautiful face.
No more wanted for her looks than her heart
her persona fades as soon as puberty starts.
She screams celebrity in a small town manner
In a world that passes judgement by how much you achieve
she must use her 'talents' as the world perceives.
As years go by her beauty's but a nuisance
to the person inside made up of more substance.
She SCREAMS celebrity in a small town manner
There's no plastic surgery to alter your soul
no place for outward beauty in the world of good will.
To wed true love's but a leap of trust
so she squanders her beauty as a matter of must.
For small town love in true Hollywood fashion."
795,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsABeautifulDayABeautifulLadyPoembyWaelKarameh,"All my days before yesterday
Were for me just a joke…
My heart is bouncing inside me now
Like nice music of the type of rock…
I wish it can express itself
And frankly can wake up out of its shock…
I am afraid you become too proud of yourself
And hesitate telling me:
“I do like you also Doc”! ! !

796,Emotion,BeautifulPoems2007BeautifulLiePoembyDeanaRode,"Standing on the edge of nothingness
the wind of regret blowing through me
as my deamons dance the ring of deception
that I'm becoming more tempted to join
'Come, ' I hear them say as they weave
'You belong to us, don't you see?
The dreams that make you scream,
the Dark Mistress that forever stands beside you,
everything that makes you who you are
is nothing but a beautiful lie to keep you alive.'
How do you fight a shadow when you are weak;
when misery is engraved into your soul?
How do you resist the urge to fade away
when all your heart ever feels is pain?
Love has long since abanonded me
Happiness stopped coming to my door years ago
and I have fallen from Grace since the day my heart broke
So with nothing to lose
and nothing to gain
I take my deamons' hand and dance...
And the lie takes my life."
797,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsYouAreBeautifulPoembyFidelisPatronus,"You are beautiful
Your love shines right through me
Every time I hear your name
It makes my cheeks red with shame
You are beautiful
And I love you
Like I love music
But you much more boldly
How about you and I go down to the park?
It makes this love more mysterious and dark
You are beautiful
Your red lips make my cheeks red
Your flowing hair makes mine stand on end
Jealousy, envy, love, and lust
You cannot be more robust
You are beautiful
Now I have described it as best I can
I should be done talking to myself now
And I think I should talk to the beautiful stranger before me
Or maybe the beautiful you is not man but is this-
Poetry
Yes I believe I will go down to the park
So it is mysterious and dark
And write about you Poetry
For I realize that Poetry is far more beautiful than thee"
798,Emotion,BeautifulPoemsPhilosophyOfBeautyAndTheBeautifulPoembyMerlinArchivilla,"Simplicity is beauty,
Purity, divinity;
The virtue of quality
Excels that of quantity.
Beauty that pleases the sense is good,
Beauty and vitue are good,
Seek for things simple but noble,
Virtue alone can ennoble.
True beauty is simply graceful,
The graceful are beautiful,
There's beauty that's deceitful,
Nature itself is beautiful,
Beauty is perfection of form,
Virtue and good sense conforms,
Beautiful things may deform,
But virtue act in good form."
799,Emotion,FuturePoemsSonnetFutureOfPoetryPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"Poems I thought had good rhythm and Rhyme,
And a moral good at the end of each;
Good Poems I thought should the test of time,
And remained well within the masses’ reach.
Poems I thought had nice music in them,
With apt words placed in right place in each case;
It was a time for Poetry’s Anthem;
Alas, the art is in for a rat-race!
Modern Poetry that is being writ,
From Prose is hard to ever from it sift;
Slang, vulgarities somehow find a place;
’Tis doomsday for poetry at this pace!
Turned has the Wheel of Time almost fully;
’Tis time to draw water with the pulley!"

801,Emotion,FuturePoemsLetterOfRecommendationFromMyFatherToMyFutureWifePoembyRichardJones,"During the war, I was in China.
Every night we blew the world to hell.
The sky was purple and yellow
like his favorite shirt.
I was in India once
on the Ganges in a tourist boat.
There were soldiers,
some women with parasols.
A dead body floated  by
going in the opposite direction.
My son likes this story
and requests it each year at Thanksgiving.
When he was twelve,
there was an accident.
He almost went blind.
For three weeks he lay in the hospital,
his eyes bandaged.
He did not like visitors,
but if they came
he'd silently hold their hand as they talked.
Small attentions
are all he requires.
Tell him you never saw anyone
so adept
at parallel parking.
Still, your life will not be easy.
Just look in the drawer where he keeps his socks.
Nothing matches.  And what's the turtle shell
doing there, or the map of the moon,
or the surgeon's plastic model of a take-apart heart?
You must understand --
he doesn't see the world clearly.
Once he screamed, ""The woods are on fire!""
when it was only a blue cloud of insects
lifting from the trees.
But he's a good boy.
He likes to kiss
and be kissed.
I remember mornings
he would wake me, stroking my whiskers
and kissing my hand.
He'll tell you -- and it's true --
he prefers the green of your eyes
to all the green life
of heaven and earth.
Anonymous submission."

804,Emotion,FuturePoemsPastAndFuturePoembySarojiniNaidu,"The new hath come and now the old retires:
And so the past becomes a mountain-cell,
Where lone, apart, old hermit-memories dwell
In consecrated calm, forgotten yet
Of the keen heart that hastens to forget
Old longings in fulfilling new desires.
And now the Soul stands in a vague, intense
Expectancy and anguish of suspense,
On the dim chamber-threshold . . . lo! he sees
Like a strange, fated bride as yet unknown,
His timid future shrinking there alone,
Beneath her marriage-veil of mysteries."
805,Emotion,FuturePoemsMyFutureLovePoembyDavidHarris,"Before me stands I see,
a faceless form of the future.
I see an engraved darkness of her face,
so that I shall not know,
who this faceless person will be,
or our meeting how.
An before me I see the beauty of all creation,
so that I shall know not to yield to temptation.
For every mortal there is a weakness,
and within this weakness, temptation has its strength.
For me after my future love I’ve seen,
temptation seems heartless and mean.
Even though I guard against,
I am helpless in a sense.
For like a flower straight and tall,
must bend with the wind.
Therefore, I must lean a little when temptation calls.

809,Emotion,FuturePoemsMaskOfFuturePoembyVivekKartha,"Dreams weren’t farfetched for me
Life wasn’t bad for me
I got everything I wanted,
Power and ability, and even opportunity
But I ignored something unknown.
I got an opportunity,
But I did not complete my wish.
I did not misuse my opportunity,
But this world has a sequence.
A flow which we all follow
Something I failed to do.
I used my powers at the wrong time.
I stepped into higher steps ignoring the lower ones.
But I failed to realize something,
I failed to realize that everything required a basement.
A basement on which it can stand.
A power on which it can function.
I ignored the lower aspects of my life,
I went for the larger ones and accomplished them with ease
But there were two things in the lower steps.
Two things that I ignored.
Time and patience.
I ignored the aspect of time, and looked into the future.
I lacked patience and was eager to reach the future.
But I failed to realize that the future did not exist.
We can never reach our future.
For, when we reach it, it becomes the present.
I failed to realize that the future is yet another present,
A present which I always ignored.
I failed to realize that we can control only our present.
Use the present wisely, and the future will follow up.
I failed to see the hidden mask of future.
A mask, if opened, showed that the future is just another present."

'My future will not copy fair my past'—
I wrote that once; and thinking at my side
My ministering life-angel justified
The word by his appealing look upcast
To the white throne of God, I turned at last,
And there, instead, saw thee, not unallied
To angels in thy soul! Then I, long tried
By natural ills, received the comfort fast,
While budding, at thy sight, my pilgrim's staff
Gave out green leaves with morning dews impearled.
I seek no copy now of life's first half:
Leave here the pages with long musing curled,
And write me new my future's epigraph,
New angel mine, unhoped for in the world!"
811,Emotion,FuturePoemsTheFutureMiddleEastPoembyBobGotti,"Today the future in the Middle East, as we hear, sounds very bleak.
As people with a deceptive heart, are looking for a brand new start,
Moving many men to understand, a crucial need to remap the land.
This to eradicate the Land of Israel, totally justified by a wicked will.
The tiny land men call Palestine, will be subdued by a force Divine.
The promise given to Abraham, by the will of God will forever stand.
The terror that now rules the land, will be eliminated by God’s Hand.
The Lord Himself shall intervene, with His presence upon the scene.
The present land on the world scene, was the land of the Philistines.
That ancient land was conquered by, Joshua’s army for God on high.
It was never subdued totally friend, but that mistake was not the end.
Eternal God, whose land this is, through King David took care of this.
For God put David on the Throne, in that land which is Israel’s home,
As the King of the Promised Land, that God had granted to Abraham.
God swore to David as the King, the reign he began was everlasting.
He reigned as King in Jerusalem, where all shall see God’s Own Son.
The land will be subdued for sure, by Jesus Christ, Messiah and Lord.
Never again shall it be the same, after Jesus Christ begins His Reign.
Christ will purge The Promised Land, for the descendents of Abraham.
Then all of Israel shall live secure, under the Reign of Christ our Lord.

812,Emotion,FuturePoemsTheYouthToTheFuturePoembyFrancisDuggan,"I've had a good innings time has left me gray
The future belongs to the youth of today
Allow them their passion for time hurries by
As life is for to live well and for to enjoy,
Our biological time clocks on our lives are ticking away
And though wisdom comes with ageing some are known to say
And though credit should be given to whoever it's due
No fool like an old fool can also be true,
Allow the youth their passion allow them to dream
Though reality in their eyes may not be what it seem
In the eyes of a child one in their twenties is one who looks old
We believe all we see but not all we are told
And though for saying it many may say of me that I am wrong
The youth to the future will always belong."
813,Emotion,FuturePoemsTheFutureMrsBlingFunPoembyLisaCresswellWilkinson,"Now this lady she parades round her shopping mall
She admires herself as she stands strong and tall
She window shops the jewellers but doesnt buy a thing
But somehow comes home all kitted out in Bling
She spends many a night gambling her benefits on strip poker
But loses the lot to her friend the pawn broker
She begs her future hubby, shes so desperate she'll rob
'If you want gems my love you'll have to go get a job'
Hes doing a stretch in prison - got hammered with 'life'
For selling his poor seventy five year old wife
She was the first bride that  he met on the net
But his obsession for bling got as hard as it could get
So he made out an advert  that said 'Lady of the night'
And put up her pic on that famous auction site
Now Earnest he sleeps with Babs pic by his bed
The magistrates have solemly granted they wed
But poor old Earnest Bling aint a penny to his name
So his dear fiancee Babs takes a job 'on the game'
Now the happy day arrives, her dress black and gold pleat
Along comes handcuffed Earnest -who has freezing cold feet
'Im jilting you darling Ive been foolish you see'
'Marriage is for life and I need to be free! '"
814,Emotion,FuturePoemsAFutureDayPoembySandraOsborne,"I think about the future,
And I wonder about our life.
To much hate for one planet,
To much fear.
Somehow,
I missed the announcement
That love had died,
I missed her funeral,
I hope it was nice.
Lost;
The masses cling to faith,
While the homeless
Cling to paper sacks,
Filled with empty dreams,
Fading, like old yellow newspapers,
In the rain.
In the future,
There will be a day,
When life
Will be worth more than greed;
And paper sacks,
Are just paper sacks.
I hope it comes soon."

Ark of my hopes, Ark of my dreams;
Sweep lordly o'er the drowned Past,
Fly glittering through the sun's strange beams;
Sail fast, sail fast.
Breaths of new buds from off some drying lea
With news about the Future scent the sea:
My brain is beating like the heart of Haste:
I'll loose me a bird upon this Present waste;
Go, trembling song,
And stay not long; oh, stay not long:
Thou'rt only a gray and sober dove,
But thine eye is faith and thy wing is love."
817,Emotion,FuturePoemsFutureLessBrightPoembylaurenrogers,"the world beyond our shameless eyes
is drowning more than we can see
where money is what cheating buys
but never seems to grow on trees
tomorrow's dreams of yesterday
have dissipated in the heat
of poisons and ozone decay
while houses crumble in the street
our lives drone on repeatedly
toiling toward some unknown end
forlorn attempts die feebly
to fix what time itself can't mend
the government is fraudulent
and slightly skewed toward tyrany
what they say and what they meant
shout greed and mass hypocrisy
and for the future we invest
no questions asked, no answers raised
about the past we joke and jest
yet disregard the present days
but who's to blame, and who's to say?
why should the 'Land of Liberty'
or any other nation pay
for crimes of all humanity?"
818,Emotion,FuturePoemsThePromisingFutureOfASpinsterPoembyauthorunknown,"It's frightening.
I feel better,
but I'm longing for a kiss.
One simple kiss
or maybe
not so simple.
I just want someone
to hold me when
the nights are empty.
Or maybe when I am
Far away, someone
to call me
when I'm blue.
I feel safer w/o someone
I'm free to linger, to laugh,
To flirt
But self esteem points
have reached down to the
negatives since my last
pathetic boyfriend.
I sit down sometimes and think:
Who the hell am I angry at?
Am I angry at the world?
Am I angry at you?
I'm not sure.
All I know is that the
more someone loves me
the more I hate them.
The more someone rejects me
That's when I want them around.
I guess I was doomed to lead
a dreary spinster life,
Or maybe settle down
with some rich jerk
who doesn't want me.
Either way I won't get very
many kisses or a phone
call when I'm far
away and
lonely."

we will repair them at a future time,
we can stop to help an injured soul,
for a brief moment in time as we go.

What our mission is, only someone else knows.
We will know what it is

bare feet, brown feet with whiter soles
drum on the dusty, hard brown earth, stomp the rhythm
as if to wake the gods of earth
to draw the rain down to the roots,
caressing seeds against the growing time,
hearing the tears at the heart of things;
hearing the shuffle-clank
of leg irons listening for some rhythm that consoles
with promise; hearing the blues sung softly, like a prayer,
taken up across the cotton field,
sadness meeting hope in longing patience
and  a century ago
the white lady who loved Africa said,
I am weary with the future
*
white boy, you’re so young –
how could you hear the blues so well?
are they just around the corner
of every town that’s built, as dusk descends?
Do they lurk wherever lips meet plangent trumpet,
in the reeds of mourning clarinet,
the nostalgia of a dreaming saxophone?
Wherever future whispers to the past
and hears the sad reply?
white boy, white boy without a past,
you hear the blues so well,
I think you hear
those future blues,
those old white future blues,
those lonesome future blues."

822,Emotion,FuturePoemsWhoKnowsWhatTheFutureWillBringPoembyFrancisDuggan,"Tis said of every individual that they can shape their own destiny
Though others will tell you quite differently and with such thinking would not agree
Who knows what will happen tomorrow who knows what your future will bring
Though at present you feel a bit ordinary and none other your praises do sing.
You may try to shape your own destiny without taking circumstance into account
And you may have great plans for the future and to little that too can amount
To if destiny does not point in that direction your destiny and circumstance
Does play a huge part in your future our gift of life came about by chance.
Who knows what will happen tomorrow you may feel sad and tearful today
Tonight you may win first division tattslotto and you can celebrate in a big way
Or tomorrow for you than today little different with your same set of worries and woes
As Shaw once said 'Life's Not Meant To Be Easy' but such is life one must suppose.
Who knows what the future will bring to you despite what some say it does seem to me
That we cannot look into the future such things are beyond us to see
Those things known as circumstance and destiny a huge part in our lives do play
And these two can make us or break us for in our future they have a big say."
823,Emotion,FuturePoemsSometimesPastPresentFuturePoembyAnubhavSharma,"Sometimes…..I travel back to my past,
Down the memory lanes.
I find myself alone, lost in vain,
I see myself struggling, to live in this world,
With pain in my heart, that I could never tell in words.
I looked for a shoulder, which could give me support,
But no one heard me and passed on to their roads,
Than you walked in, with a wonderful smile,
This gave me strength and love for life,
The touch of your hand and your talking eyes,
Made me sure, it is you for whom my heart cries.
Sometimes…I look in to my present,
With my eyes wide open,
‘cause I never thought it would happen,
My worries have gone & I have lost my pain,
All I’ve got is luv and your smile like a Summer Rain,
The power of love and the strength of your words,
Has made me eager to live in this world,
Smile on your lips and happiness in your eyes,
This is all where my world lies.
Sometimes….I look in to the future
With dreams in my eyes,
Kissing your lips at every sunrise
I see you with me wrapped in my arms,
Giving you love and all the charms,
‘cause you are the one who has changed my life,
So I always dream you as my loving wife,
Now I always wish to forget my past,
& luv you forever until my breath last,
I pray to God may my dreams come true,
& I could always tell that “I Love You”."

But one day you will be
This is your father
That one day you'll see
Theres things you should know
Things good and bad about me
I'm nice, caring, and a real friend
This is me until the end
I'm sad, depressed, and rejected
This is the bad in me
I hope you're not affected
Just because my father never would
I'll love you the best that I could
I'll be there for you, bad or good
I'll feel your pain, so you'll feel ok
Promise me, you'll go to school
I can't wait for that day
So I could lay down the father rule
Until you're born and things are such
Know that your father loves you very much."
825,Emotion,FuturePoemsRememberingTheFuturePoembyMichaelShepherd,"The Greeks said, those great Muses
who civilise us, grace our dance of life,
were once, before they were nine,
just three; and before that,
only one was named: and she was, Memory.
Does that make poets just regurgitators
of what’s already been oft said -
and better, too, some would aver…?
No, it’s more subtle than that; ask a poet:
a poem that comes warm, hot,  from the human heart
demands a summary birth; won’t hang around
while you go out to buy more toys and frills
to hang around the cot…
it is indeed,  more like remembering:
as if you step into a timeless place
where all that’s needful is to remember
what the future poem shall, will, have said..
write it down; and maybe sleep on it;
when you wake, you may remember
two lines somewhere which you’d forgotten,
but know exactly where that is…
That Muse of memory will then decide
whether a poem that has a timeless birth,
may have a timeless life... or  not...
How can a poet claim a poem as his, or hers,
when such a Muse? and yet, so close at hand?"
826,Emotion,FuturePoemsSonnetOnMyFuturePoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"I do not change my future on my own;
God has been doing that for me till now;
Amidst my earthly problems, I’m alone;
Nevertheless, I’m safe: I don’t know how?
Some people work all by themselves in life;
Their trust in themselves is more than in God;
They scheme to drive out penury and strife;
Nevertheless, they get their earthly rod.
The one who puts his trust in God is wise;
His peace of mind and heart are excellent;
The one who trusts himself lands up in vice;
He wastes his precious time that God has lent.
Have faith in God and future looks alright;
The atheist does suffer sad a plight.

828,Emotion,FuturePoemsSongOfTheFuturePoembyBanjoPaterson,"'Tis strange that in a land so strong
So strong and bold in mighty youth,
We have no poet's voice of truth
To sing for us a wondrous song.
Our chiefest singer yet has sung
In wild, sweet notes a passing strain,
All carelessly and sadly flung
To that dull world he thought so vain.
""I care for nothing, good nor bad,
My hopes are gone, my pleasures fled,
I am but sifting sand,"" he said:
What wonder Gordon's songs were sad!
And yet, not always sad and hard;
In cheerful mood and light of heart
He told the tale of Britomarte,
And wrote the Rhyme of Joyous Garde.
And some have said that Nature's face
To us is always sad; but these
Have never felt the smiling grace
Of waving grass and forest trees
On sunlit plains as wide as seas.
""A land where dull Despair is king
O'er scentless flowers and songless bird!""
But we have heard the bell-birds ring
Their silver bells at eventide,
Like fairies on the mountain side,
The sweetest note man ever heard.
The wild thrush lifts a note of mirth;
The bronzewing pigeons call and coo
Beside their nests the long day through;
The magpie warbles clear and strong
A joyous, glad, thanksgiving song,
For all God's mercies upon earth.
And many voices such as these
Are joyful sounds for those to tell,
Who know the Bush and love it well,
With all its hidden mysteries.
We cannot love the restless sea,
That rolls and tosses to and fro
Like some fierce creature in its glee;
For human weal or human woe
It has no touch of sympathy.
For us the bush is never sad:
Its myriad voices whisper low,
In tones the bushmen only know,
Its sympathy and welcome glad.
For us the roving breezes bring
From many a blossum-tufted tree --
Where wild bees murmur dreamily --
The honey-laden breath of Spring.
*       *       *       *
We have our tales of other days,
Good tales the northern wanderers tell
When bushmen meet and camp-fires blaze,
And round the ring of dancing light
The great, dark bush with arms of night
Folds every hearer in its spell.
We have our songs -- not songs of strife
And hot blood spilt on sea and land;
But lilts that link achievement grand
To honest toil and valiant life.
Lift ye your faces to the sky
Ye barrier mountains in the west
Who lie so peacefully at rest
Enshrouded in a haze of blue;
'Tis hard to feel that years went by
Before the pioneers broke through
Your rocky heights and walls of stone,
And made your secrets all their own.
For years the fertile Western plains
Were hid behind your sullen walls,
Your cliffs and crags and waterfalls
All weatherworn with tropic rains.
Between the mountains and the sea
Like Israelites with staff in hand,
The people waited restlessly:
They looked towards the mountains old
And saw the sunsets come and go
With gorgeous golden afterglow,
That made the West a fairyland,
And marvelled what that West might be
Of which such wondrous tales were told.
For tales were told of inland seas
Like sullen oceans, salt and dead,
And sandy deserts, white and wan,
Where never trod the foot of man,
Nor bird went winging overhead,
Nor ever stirred a gracious breeze
To wake the silence with its breath --
A land of loneliness and death.
At length the hardy pioneers
By rock and crag found out the way,
And woke with voices of today
A silence kept for years and tears.
Upon the Western slope they stood
And saw -- a wide expanse of plain
As far as eye could stretch or see
Go rolling westward endlessly.
The native grasses, tall as grain,
Bowed, waved and rippled in the breeze;
From boughs of blossom-laden trees
The parrots answered back again.
They saw the land that it was good,
A land of fatness all untrod,
And gave their silent thanks to God.
The way is won! The way is won!
And straightway from the barren coast
There came a westward-marching host,
That aye and ever onward prest
With eager faces to the West,
Along the pathway of the sun.
The mountains saw them marching by:
They faced the all-consuming drought,
They would not rest in settled land:
But, taking each his life in hand,
Their faces ever westward bent
Beyond the farthest settlement,
Responding to the challenge cry
of ""better country farther out"".
And lo, a miracle! the land
But yesterday was all unknown,
The wild man's boomerang was thrown
Where now great busy cities stand.
It was not much, you say, that these
Should win their way where none withstood;
In sooth there was not much of blood --
No war was fought between the seas.
It was not much! but we who know
The strange capricious land they trod --
At times a stricken, parching sod,
At times with raging floods beset --
Through which they found their lonely way
Are quite content that you should say
It was not much, while we can feel
That nothing in the ages old,
In song or story written yet
On Grecian urn or Roman arch,
Though it should ring with clash of steel,
Could braver histories unfold
Than this bush story, yet untold --
The story of their westward march.
*       *       *       *
But times are changed, and changes rung
From old to new -- the olden days,
The old bush life and all its ways,
Are passing from us all unsung.
The freedom, and the hopeful sense
Of toil that brought due recompense,
Of room for all, has passed away,
And lies forgotten with the dead.
Within our streets men cry for bread
In cities built but yesterday.
About us stretches wealth of land,
A boundless wealth of virgin soil
As yet unfruitful and untilled!
Our willing workmen, strong and skilled,
Within our cities idle stand,
And cry aloud for leave to toil.
The stunted children come and go
In squalid lanes and alleys black:
We follow but the beaten track
Of other nations, and we grow
In wealth for some -- for many, woe.
And it may be that we who live
In this new land apart, beyond
The hard old world grown fierce and fond
And bound by precedent and bond,
May read the riddle right, and give
New hope to those who dimly see
That all things yet shall be for good,
And teach the world at length to be
One vast united brotherhood.
*       *       *       *
So may it be! and he who sings
In accents hopeful, clear, and strong,
The glories which that future brings
Shall sing, indeed, a wondrous song."

830,Emotion,FuturePoemsThereIsHopeForTheFuturePoembyFrancisDuggan,"The bombs have caused death and destruction and the families mourn their dead
But there is hope for the future for better days ahead
When those for peace and World harmony will finally prevail
For those who talk of waging war are surely doomed to fail.
There is hope for the future though I may not live to see my dream
Of a better life for everyone in a World where peace will reign supreme
A World free of borders and camps for refugees
Where the smell of death and destruction is not blowing in the breeze
There is hope for the future around me not all dark
I hear young children playing in the playground in the park
The children are the future and they may well unite
Behind a peaceful leader who won't lead by power of might.
There is hope for the future and all surely not lost
Though there won't be peace tomorrow and 'twill come at a great cost
The Rose of Peace will bloom again though with the dead I lay
And the young and enlightened leaders to peace will lead the way."
831,Emotion,FuturePoemsTaintedFutureRuinousDeedsPoembyElizabethSheaffer,"Your fingertips graze across my skin...
Soft lips gently caress my warm flesh...
Exquisite pleasure building within...
A sinful lust you can't hold back...
Body aching to capture, release...
Coming together in waves of need...
A hectic rhythm that just won't cease...
Our sinful lust we can't hold back...
Fingers, nails, digging deep...
Hoarse whispers fill the air with sound...
In blissful escape together we weep...
In sinful lust we couldn't hold back...
Two months later, a small surprise...
Adding to a list of troubles...
One night, and a future of baby's cries...
It was sinful lust that ruined our lives.

834,Emotion,FuturePoemsDontTalkAboutThePastButFocusOnYourFuturePoembyMaryWismer,"Don’t talk about the past but focus on your future
I would prefer to know about the previous
relationships of the one “my one” and I would
tell him every thing about me.
I think its something that makes
us closer to each other.
Of course I don’t like to know the details
such as how much he loved
her or what he was doing to make
her happy or what ever of these details
because it will not help or do any
good thing to the relationship but
I would ask about how these relationships ended,
why and what he didn’t like about them.....
But after talking about such things
with your partner you shouldn’t be
judgmental and you should never
talk about it again, or listen to any
one else talking to you about it,
or use it against him / her someday
because that would break your partner’s
heart and he/she will never be honest with you again.
Just listen, take what you wanted  to know,
and throw the story behind your back.
Just keep in your mind that it’s the past
and you are your partner’s present and future
and this is the only important thing now and forever.
I personally believe you should give
the second part as much information
as he/she plans to drag out of you.
If one needs to know the name of every
other gender person you talked to,
then squeeze your mind and remember.
If he/she only asks for headlines,
then go ahead and offer them but
spare him/her the details if he/she seems
not wanting to bother him/herself with the
details of a past history.
What I'm trying to say, let the other part decide
how much they want to know, and work accordingly.

scorched sky-
pastel people, rainbows of the world
So many dreams and nightmares
I would like to leave with you,
if I could bring my pen
to touch the page.
We are time:
wrapped neatly in flesh and bone and thoughts-
We are lost-
we look for castles in the clouds,
cities beneath the earth-
learn of our history to understand our future.
We toil and cry with our Mothers to be born of our Father's flesh.
They tell me: life is a blessing, no matter the circumstance,
no matter that we are born, drunk on our Mother's failures,
made to bear the burdens of our Father.
Mother says: I labored to bring you into this world.
I tell her: and I will labor when you leave it.

Ir orbit around an endangered earth.
Lost among the skyhawks of futuristic power..
I’m sworn to take an oath.
To move unseen through portholes in chase.
Where eyes of an eagle sore  deep dark space.

Protected, without fear, in a bubble I roam.
Man crushed the evergreens of earth.
Water contamination, no more rebirth.

And wit me warns to shun such snares as threaten mine annoy;
For falsehood now doth flow, and subjects' faith doth ebb,
Which should not be if reason ruled or wisdom weaved the web.
But clouds of joys untried do cloak aspiring minds,
Which turn to rain of late repent by changed course of winds.
The top of hope supposed the root upreared shall be,
And fruitless all their grafted guile, as shortly ye shall see.
The dazzled eyes with pride, which great ambition blinds,
Shall be unsealed by worthy wights whose foresight falsehood finds.
The daughter of debate that discord aye doth sow
Shall reap no gain where former rule still peace hath taught to know.
No foreign banished wight shall anchor in this port;
Our realm brooks not seditious sects, let them elsewhere resort.
My rusty sword through rest shall first his edge employ
To poll their tops that seek such change or gape for future joy."

845,Emotion,FuturePoemsTheFuturePoembyMatthewArnold,"A wanderer is man from his birth.
He was born in a ship
On the breast of the river of Time;
Brimming with wonder and joy
He spreads out his arms to the light,
Rivets his gaze on the banks of the stream.
As what he sees is, so have his thoughts been.
Whether he wakes,
Where the snowy mountainous pass,
Echoing the screams of the eagles,
Hems in its gorges the bed
Of the new-born clear-flowing stream;
Whether he first sees light
Where the river in gleaming rings
Sluggishly winds through the plain;
Whether in sound of the swallowing sea--
As is the world on the banks,
So is the mind of the man.
Vainly does each, as he glides,
Fable and dream
Of the lands which the river of Time
Had left ere he woke on its breast,
Or shall reach when his eyes have been closed.
Only the tract where he sails
He wots of; only the thoughts,
Raised by the objects he passes, are his.
Who can see the green earth any more
As she was by the sources of Time?
Who imagines her fields as they lay
In the sunshine, unworn by the plough?
Who thinks as they thought,
The tribes who then roam'd on her breast,
Her vigorous, primitive sons?
What girl
Now reads in her bosom as clear
As Rebekah read, when she sate
At eve by the palm-shaded well?
Who guards in her breast
As deep, as pellucid a spring
Of feeling, as tranquil, as sure?
What bard,
At the height of his vision, can deem
Of God, of the world, of the soul,
With a plainness as near,
As flashing as Moses felt
When he lay in the night by his flock
On the starlit Arabian waste?
Can rise and obey
The beck of the Spirit like him?
This tract which the river of Time
Now flows through with us, is the plain.
Gone is the calm of its earlier shore.
Border'd by cities and hoarse
With a thousand cries is its stream.
And we on its breast, our minds
Are confused as the cries which we hear,
Changing and shot as the sights which we see.
And we say that repose has fled
For ever the course of the river of Time.
That cities will crowd to its edge
In a blacker, incessanter line;
That the din will be more on its banks,
Denser the trade on its stream,
Flatter the plain where it flows,
Fiercer the sun overhead.
That never will those on its breast
See an ennobling sight,
Drink of the feeling of quiet again.
But what was before us we know not,
And we know not what shall succeed.
Haply, the river of Time--
As it grows, as the towns on its marge
Fling their wavering lights
On a wider, statelier stream--
May acquire, if not the calm
Of its early mountainous shore,
Yet a solemn peace of its own.
And the width of the waters, the hush
Of the grey expanse where he floats,
Freshening its current and spotted with foam
As it draws to the Ocean, may strike
Peace to the soul of the man on its breast--
As the pale waste widens around him,
As the banks fade dimmer away,
As the stars come out, and the night-wind
Brings up the stream
Murmurs and scents of the infinite sea."
846,Emotion,FuturePoemsFuturePoembyRemaPrasanaa,"Near the shore of that eventful destiny,
hold us no resentments of the past.
From the mistakes of the past, let us
not challenge the present and my friend,
I know I hurt you and even you hurt me.
For the time on which we heal the past
and erase our eroded egos
and I promise I cause you
no further harm, from my anger
on which I reacted but not intentional.
Calm now the seashore and I know
it is not easy to forget the clouds
of shadows covered on one
good friendship and at the end
wisdom is not a flagship label
to  cover the pretences of life
And i feel it is time to forget and forgive
in grace as life is too short to settle
scores on a battlefield to dampen
the creative brightness of  future..

By the cracking fire we’ll coddle round.
Each and ev’ry one will form a bond.

No recipe is ours to follow
Flitting in the night with the swallows.
Around and around we’ll make a ring.

A place full of greed and much less forgiving
In back streets and alley's, in dust and decay
A new breed of child reaches out for the day
A child of the future, quick witted and sour
His ambition survival, He lives for the hour
Nobodys child with nowhere to run
Allegiance to no one, and a needle for fun
No one to care if he lives or he die's
No child protection to witness his cries
If this is our future, then there isn't much hope
You know what they say, if you give enough rope
Put a price on the misery, we leave in this world
Small ragged bundles curled up in the cold
Wheres the compassion, Have we no sense of shame!
If we sow fields of sorrow, then expect crops of pain."

(If they ever come my way)
The beauty of a sunset
At the ending of the day?
Can I walk into a forest,
And surround myself with trees,
Yet know that it will remain,
For me to visit as I please.
I know that I can today
Do all the things I’ve said,
But when today is yesterday,
Will all these things be dead?

As we gradually take heed,
So we must fix it quickly,
Using words and thoughts and deeds.'"

Of dreams that fly through skies and earth,
And in your flight, unite, my fellows,
The Love and Death.
They said in their pledge eternal
That they are slaves of the bad past,
That they were born in dust infernal,
And will return again to dust.
Your heedless brightness was aroused
By songs of lyre, mad and fine,
Eternity will be your spouse,
The world – a shrine.
All folk were utterly believing
That they must live and love with smiles,
That woman is a child of sinning,
Who’s marked by sins a hundred times.
But different, unearthly sounds
Were brought to you by running years,
And you will take to Snow Crowns

A face with no future,
stares out at me.
On the table, a glass and a bottle,
of my favourite poison.
When I was young,
I drank to be alive.
Now all I do,
is drink to survive.
My eyes bloodshot,
filled with vacant stare.
My face goes unshaven,
but what do I care?
My bottle is now empty,
quickly replace with one full.
Soon it will be empty,
just like this fool.
Family and friends fled.
My eyes were blind.
All they could see,
was another drink,
in front of me.
My legs get unsteady.
I stagger instead of walk.
A bottle wrapped in paper,
gripped tightly by my hand.
My clothes grow dirty,
as days and nights combine.
A smile is frozen,
on this face of mine.
My arm flex out,
when I stumble to the ground.
Faces look down at me,
expressions display my waste.
I just hold my smile,
as I lay there in their midst.
At least my bottle,
didn’t break,
on my fall from grace.
Time for another drink,
raise bottle to my lips.
Liquid trickles down my throat,
and still my smile remains,
as silly as it can be.
The faces disappear.
Everyone has gone now.
Like family and friends,
they all desert.
I lay there on my own.
For no one wants to take,
a drunk home.

852,Emotion,FuturePoemsTheFlowersOfTheFuturePoembyMaryWismer,"The Flowers of the Future
-At present you plant a seed of truth, for your beautiful blossoms of the future
I am a diligent gardener,
Who walked into your heartland by chance,
I saw the large land out of cultivation,
Seems there has not been a spring for a long time.
So I said,
'Let's cultivate here a little. Make it a lawn.'
You said impatiently,
'Forget it! You are wasting your effort.'
I smiled,
'Let's grow some flowers here and make it a garden.'
You hesitated and said,
'Forget it. I don't see any meaning in it.'
I drew your hand to me and put a seed in it, a sparkling seed with fantastic splendour.
'This seed is called Truth.
It can blossom into the most beautiful flower in the world.'
Curiosity flashed through your eyes,
'The most beautiful flower in the world? '
'Yes, people call that flower Future! '
Then I held your hands and planted the fantastic seed in the land.
The Truth then took root, sprouted, and had its first leaf.
You were so happy, you watered and fertilised it everyday.
You blocked the wind and kept the rain off
Just like this,
Together with the seed,
You went through the chilly spring, hot summer, desolate fall and piercingly cold winter.
When the last chill in the wind faded,
The seed of Truth had its first bud.
You were so excited that you could not sleep for nights.
Waiting aside for the flower to burst
Finally, on that unusual morning,
Butterflies dancing over the grass,
Birds singing on the branches,
The bud burst into a flower,
So beautiful and moving.
The splendour of Truth suddenly cast colourful lights upon the meadow.
You clapped your hands and shouted loudly,
'Hurry up and look, Gardener.
Our Truth has blossomed.
How beautiful is our Future! '
However, the Gardener had already left quietly, leaving the beautiful Future for you.
Later, the meadow became a garden, with beautiful flowers of Future all over.
You named the garden a pleasant name:
'Future Garden'
Will you still occasionally think of me, the gardener?
If so, just whisper my name.
I will definitely hear you.
I will quietly stand above the clouds,
And look at you with smile.

And perhaps in a decade from now the super rich will become poorer when they realize their money cannot buy
Gas to put into their big cars parked in their garages the people with nowhere to go
To yet it is a known fact out of hardship that spirituality can grow.
We are being told that this is to happen by those one might say in the know
The oil reserves won't last forever we heard of that decades ago
Yet what did we do to conserve energy we went out and bought bigger cars
And spent billions in money and wasted huge amounts of energy building rockets for research on Mars
What will happen when the oil wells will run dry when the super rich will realize
That Government Bureaucracies them were deceiving and leading them on with their lies
Will billionaires jump off of big buildings when with financial disaster they come face to face
In a decade from now the World as we know it could be a much different place.
In the future the World will be different and that may not be such a bad thing
For Nature will live on as usual and songbirds in the morning will sing
And we must go back to the pushbikes and with less pollution in the air
We will be far healthier people and more spiritually and environmentally aware."

Of heartache and pain.

With the hope of peace diminishing,
The heart has no definitive song.
We've waited for an end to hostilities,
But the struggle seems so long.
Yet - there is hope for the future,
Liberty and freedom are still in command,
But God will make the ultimate decisions.
He will evaluate our worldly demands,
And he holds the future in his grasp.
Why should we despair?
He mourns and counts every tear,
And he hears and reviews every prayer."

I have seen the valleys of death

I have suffocated immortals with breath
I have run from sure victory
I have stared in the face of defeat
I have bottled the wind from the ocean
I have prevailed when surely beat
All this I have done
All this and more
I know what the past is
But none of what's in store
Will the earth convulse in sadness?
Will dawn break and joy reign again?
Can we venture to the depths of space?
Can we travel to any when?
Confusion and a cacophony
Of breath and stilling air

Because we are already there"
857,Emotion,FuturePoemsVowsToMyFriendsDedicatedToAllMyPresentAndFutureFriendsPoembyAlexandriaValena,"I will always love my friends,
Forever or until my life ends.
I will treat them with respect,
Even when long days make me feel like a tiny speck.
I vow to hug them tight,
When nothing seems to be going right.
I propmise to be true,
Because there is nothing better i can do.
I promise to open up,
To those of them that feel beat up!
My friends, i can keep a secret,
Im the one you can tell and not feel regret.
These are the vows to my friends,
I promise to love you till the end."
858,Emotion,FuturePoemsFutureWithOutMePoembyMichaelCarlson,"I never really imagined me
The me in the future, who I'd and where
People ask me, but all i do is stop and stare
Staring through them, it's like i cannot see
I never thought of myself in the future
Because all i ever wanted was to die
And then now people ask me, so i start to try
But i still can't see me....why?
I want to be with her
In the times yet to come
But if I'll be there I'm not really sure
It makes me feel so dumb
Maybe i won't be around then
Maybe I'll be long since gone
But when i ask myself, when
When might i leave, and forget all I've ever been"
859,Emotion,FuturePoemsMyFuturePoembyRobertWilliamService,"""Let's make him a sailor,"" said Father,
""And he will adventure the sea.""
""A soldier,"" said Mother, ""is rather
What I would prefer him to be.""
""A lawyer,"" said Father, ""would please me,
For then he could draw up my will.""
""A doctor,"" said Mother, ""would ease me;
Maybe he could give me a pill.""
Said Father: ""Lt's make him a curate,
A Bishop in gaiters to be.""
Said Mother: ""I couldn't endure it
To have Willie preaching to me.""
Said Father: """"Let him be a poet;
So often he's gathering wool.""
Said Mother with temper: ""Oh stow it!
You know it, a poet's a fool.""
Said Farther: ""Your son is a duffer,
A stupid and mischievous elf.""
Said Mother, who's rather a huffer:
""That's right - he takes after yourself.""
Controlling parental emotion
They turned to me, seeking a cue,
And sudden conceived the bright notion
To ask what I wanted to do.
Said I: ""my ambition is modest:
A clown in a circus I'd be,
And turn somersaults in the sawdust
With audience laughing at me.""
. . . Poor parents! they're dead and decaying,
But I am a clown as you see;
And though in no circus I'm playing,
How people are laughing at me!"
860,Emotion,FuturePoemsBackToTheFuturePoembySulaimanMohdYusof,"The year is 2285
Everyone is getting high
It’s all about high profile
To live is to die
No more prison and trial
A free world to compile
All your sins will fly
The judgment is yours to consider
Money for nothing to ponder
Distance yourself further
No retreat and no surrender
The going will get wilder
The tough will get weaker
The ozone layer became thinner
The icebergs had landed
Low lying lands became embedded
Like thrusting a knife that is jagged
Seems like most parts are flooded
Highlands are barricaded
Population intakes are limited
To survive is to be restricted
Who’s the poor and who’s the richest?
It’s a taboo to say and yet superstitious
To be in power would be the strongest
Sharing your power could be the longest
To live that long is tremendous
And the poor would become notorious
To be left out as the monotonous
Global warming has taken its toll
It’s not like walking in the park to stroll
The heat could penetrate even your soul
No more south and north pole
Your best next home is in the hole"
861,Emotion,FuturePoemsTheMusingsOfAFutureDeadPoetPoembyTedSheridan,"You do not
confuse me
you only confound
the issues.
I am not taken back
by your ignorance
only slightly
delayed by it
as I struggle
to understand
why I should care.
I am weakened
by my sense
of humanity
not by my love for it...
for my love
is the one true strength
that keeps you
from destroying me
as I pause
to consider
any possible
method to your madness......"
862,Emotion,FuturePoemsFutureSelectedPoembyBridgidPatrick,"A memory or two
Returning...reappearing
Surprisingly entering our hearts again
Not the same...always rearranged
Haunting and intriguing
Living and dying
Pushing and pulling
Remembering togetherness
Moments of shared hearts
In the midst of isolation
Remembering that we were
Not alone
No longer applying
Such long forgotten
Traces of feeling and thought
Never again will our lives
Be as they were
A future uncertain...
With unknown duration
Past reflected as if present
Selecting each moment
Wondering...searching for meaning
Past changing...as the future
Takes hold of us"
863,Emotion,FuturePoemsPastPresentAndFuturePoembyDeepaThomas,"Sitting in my garden chair
Surrounded with little flowers
Breeze tenderly touching
And lending a new feel
Brooding over the past
Thinking about wins and failures
About the people walked out
About the things not done
Getting away with present
No time to stop and think
Just doing, doing and doing
Just what is necessary today!
Hoping for the future
Dreaming of new horizons
About that special someone
And how life will change"
864,Emotion,FuturePoemsSonnetXliiMyFuturePoembyElizabethBarrettBrowning,"My future will not copy fair my past -
I wrote that once; and thinking at my side
My ministering life-angel justified
The word by his appealing look upcast
To the white throne of God, I turned at last,
And there, instead, saw thee, not unallied
To angels in thy soul! Then I, long tried
By natural ills, received the comfort fast,
While budding, at thy sight, my pilgrim's staff
Gave out green leaves with morning dews impearled.
I seek no copy now of life's first half:
Leave here the pages with long musing curled,
And write me new my future's epigraph,
New angel mine, unhoped for in the world!"
865,Emotion,FuturePoemsLookToTheFuturePoembyLeahHarlow,"Look to the future
Detach from the past
Let the people go
Start a new this time
Look to the future
Love like it’ll last
Dream like it’s forever
No move envy
Look to the future
Have the star life
Learn from others
Take it in
Look to the future
Be proud with yourself
No more lies
No more disguises
Look to the future
Solve the unresolved
Be someone’s firefly
Stop living for yourself
Look to the future
Be the person
You dream to be
Stop fantasizing
Look to the future
It’s only gets brighter
From here on out
Detach from the past
Look to the future"
866,Emotion,FuturePoemsTaleOfFuturePastPoembyDoomandGloom,"As mountains dwell in timeless sleep, as seasons come and go
As oceans roll across the deep, as forests slowly grow
An evil has been gathering, a dark age has begun
All life on earth shall rue this day, the time of man has come
With axe and pick that chop and chip, the land shall be stripped bare
With fire and steel, that burn and deal a death to all who care
With hate and greed, that fuel and feed the coming of the end
Into a fate consumed with hate our world will now descend
As mountains wake, roar and quake, as seasons loose their sway
As oceans rise to turn the tide, and forests die away
A giant is awakening, a cleansing will ensue
All life on earth shall rue this day; the debt of man is due
With rock and flame that smash and maim, life shall be erased
With flood and wave, that drowns and paves a path to deaths embrace
Mother earth begins again, but none remain to tell
That the balance is precarious, between paradise and hell"

868,Emotion,FuturePoemsVanishingFuturePoembyOskarHansen,"The Vanishing Future
The lake we swam in, as children, is now
a sea of knee high thistles, in summer
evenings, that had no night, we fished for
trout, now I see empty tins of sardines
blinking in fading sunlight
I had travelled long to get here fifty years
or so, my old home was an oblong square
on ugly ground, but I did find a rusty
spade to dig my tiny space while smoking
a last cigarette or two."
869,Emotion,FuturePoemsTheFuturePoembyRainerMariaRilke,"The future: time's excuse
to frighten us; too vast
a project, too large a morsel

Future, who won't wait for you?
Everyone is going there.
It suffices you to deepen
the absence that we are.

870,Emotion,FuturePoemsLightInTheFuturePoembyaryaindiaindia,"The soul it seeks to perch and pray
A tune that renders fine
Without a stop when started forth
It hopes to sing a line
With feathers wafting at its crest
Like hornets in its nest
In storm and lightning thunderous sounds
Appeal to all in zest
The warmth that beats within the chest
Is hard concealed to spin
But in the cold and on the seas
Its surely bound to win"
871,Emotion,FuturePoemsThePastIsThePastAwaitForTheFuturePoembySalimahNubee,"Yesterday you ignored me
Today you think of me
Years ago, you cursed me, backbite me
Today I’m called a good person
Months ago, I was rejected for no clear reasons
Today you say if I had known, I would have accepted you
Weeks ago, I cried out my heart longing to befriend you
Today tears are flowing, longing to see me, to feel my presence, to befriend me, to hear at least my breath…
Why when it’s too late you will regret
Why regret when you could think
I was someone alone with myself and in crowd of people
You would raise your eyes when I’m falling into ruins, when I wrongly act
You would ignore me when I do good
Why you have power to hurt when I’m here
And the present would fade such power into tears, into regrets when I’m no more
Why you would call my name when a freezed air separate us now
Please don’t cry now…
Please don’t hurt my memory…
Please don’t long to see me now…
I want to return back and cry with you to pacify you
Today I’m no more in your world; I see how important I am to you
I want to return back now but it’s too late
A last word…..
Keep your feelings till we meet again
Let me go now… Peacefully At Least… To my new abode
Don’t let me miss you now…
My time has come suddenly, but the clock has not yet stopped for you
You could not love me when I was here; All you can do now is to learn how to love others in your world now…"
872,Emotion,FuturePoemsAsForTheFuturePoembyTiaMaria,"We hear it over again
Live for today
For tomorrow
May be the end
Still another day
Comes and goes
What I did with it
Nobody really knows
Tomorrow is
another day
And will be fuller
Come what may
For though the future
Is not mine to predict
Still many more boxes
Waiting to be ticked"

Hear what God the Lord hath spoken,
""O my people, faint and few,
Comfortless, afflicted, broken,
Fair abodes I build for you.
Thorns of heartfelt tribulation
Shall no more perplex your ways;
You shall name your walls, Salvation,
And your gates shall all be Praise.
""There, like streams that feed the garden,
Pleasures without end shall flow,
For the Lord, your faith rewarding,
All His bounty shall bestow;
Still in undisturb'd possession
Peace and righteousness shall reign;
Never shall you feel oppression,
Hear the voice of war again.
""Ye no more your suns descending,
Waning moons no more shall see;
But your griefs forever ending,
Find eternal noon in me:
God shall rise, and shining o'er ye,
Change to day the gloom of night;
He, the Lord, shall be your glory,
God your everlasting light."""

if i can slow down or even stop my past becoming my future
i can  see it comin a mile away
what can i do? what can i say?
who even cares seriously cause in all reality im not even sure that i do..

875,Emotion,FuturePoemsModernLoveXiiNotSolelyThatTheFuturePoembyGeorgeMeredith,"Not solely that the Future she destroys,
And the fair life which in the distance lies
For all men, beckoning out from dim rich skies:
Nor that the passing hour's supporting joys
Have lost the keen-edged flavour, which begat
Distinction in old times, and still should breed
Sweet Memory, and Hope,--earth's modest seed,
And heaven's high-prompting: not that the world is flat
Since that soft-luring creature I embraced,
Among the children of Illusion went:
Methinks with all this loss I were content,
If the mad Past, on which my foot is based,
Were firm, or might be blotted: but the whole
Of life is mixed: the mocking Past will stay:
And if I drink oblivion of a day,
So shorten I the stature of my soul."
876,Emotion,FuturePoemsIAmAFutureLeaderPoembykelvinkarani,"From the outset I must state
Old men (especially these!)  and (some)  women
Are not in me to hate
And thunderstorm I pray them not to strike
Because that is where I am headed
You all know and can certainly see
The truth, so by Amadiora may I not be beheaded
Most if not at all all offices around
Have sleepy octogenarians sleeping on the job
Waking up to remind me that my turn will come round
In the future, not near, not far- somewhere there
I am future leader you see
And so was my father before me
Who in that moment of despondency
Took to chang’aa- the local gin
Searching for hope in there- such futility!
Trying to discover the future in him
Unfortunately, he died of the liver disease
When he was about to be the future leader
Sort of!
All the while the increasingly old man and woman
Through press release s and conferences
Promised him and me as well
That we were leaders of tomorrow
What tomorrow I will ask not for now I know
Perhaps I should be like that Obama boy
Seizing the moment to bring the needed change"
877,Emotion,FuturePoemsWeAreTheFuturePoembyKansasJohnson,"We are the future
with our spikes and chains,
our baggy pants,
And unused brains
We are the future
With our belly shirts,
Hooker boots,
In mini skirts
We are the future
with our torn up jeans,
our rude t-shirts,
Wearing diamond rings
We are the future
With our high dollar clothes,
our rap music,
Pink polished toes
We are the future
And our parents hope and pray
That we'll all grow out
Of this someday"

The time  is racing my past behind me
NO!
My past in front,
My future behind,
I wasn't thinking of my future,
I was back in my past.
But now this is my story! ! ! !
A mother who did not love me,
A sister a  brother trying to comfort me,
I felt all alone
Now inhale
and
Exhale.
My future
A mother, A brother, once upon a time a father,
But no more
I stride for my future,
Not for my past
I tell you children
NEVER Look Back! ! !
But i do wondering......
I f my past was different would my future be better?
Would it?
Never mind that,
The time is racing to my future
I live for today and NOT tomarrow.
So I Never Look Back."
880,Emotion,FuturePoemsMyFuturePoembyRejectedSuicide,"today i cry myself to sleep
tomorrow i still just weep
next week, my spiral still goes down
feeling like a big clown
not knowing where i'll end up...
i panic, trying to save money but,
losing it to too many bills
next month, will i be over the hill?
or living in my car?
or working at the Nevada bar?
it scares me to think about it
i dont like my life one bit
wishing i'd be hit by a truck
but i dont have such good luck
today i cry myself to sleep
tomorrow is still just weep
next week my sprial still goes down.
Next month...it scares me not to know.

881,Emotion,FuturePoemsPastPresentFuturePoembyStanleyCooper,"They spend no time together
Yet they're relatively linked
These three birds of a feather
Who march through time in sync
Present is right now
Past is just before it
Future rightly vows
Nothing will detour it
The past flies by too fast
It's movement so incessant
And with a final gasp
Bestows on us the present
The past is understood
When at present we look back
Most memories are good
But some do sadly lack
For the time that's yet to be
The future, as it's known
Let's prepare it present-ly
With good memories all it's own"
882,Emotion,FuturePoemsTheFutureUnknownPoembyBrieCarter,"Within the dread of the moment
I must dought that Shakespeare
Sat up all night, Writing his plays
Knowing they'd be timeless
One man
An epic in writing
By accident
Maybe one day
Once I have long since passed
Someone will come across
The pages I breathed life into
And maybe, out of mere curiosity
They may read my words and find symbolism
That I never meant to include
Maybe, in 300 years
I shall be an epic in the world of poetry
(If one still reads poetry by then)
And maybe I'll become famous as Shakespeare
Or Edgar Allen Poe; maybe I'll be known
For something I never meant to do
Myabe I'll be known for this"

My future uncertain
Who am i
Who are they

My past
My Present

Yet i don't know my future
But i hope i thrive on what i have learned
And what i have learned is what will make me surrive

Here on Earth or out in space
The doors are open if you choose
To learn the skills that you can use
Computers you use every day
Atomic medicine is here to stay
A walk on the moon is a thing of the past
We're on our way to the stars at long last
Radar, and laser, and quasar, and such,
These words sound strange, but they mean so much
Learn these things, and many more
See what wonders the world has in store
Don't let folly lead you away
From Learning the skills you need so today
Have fun in your life, but don't learn with sorrow
That the fun of today won't feed you tomorrow
Be good to yourself, and study with zest,
And, soon, you will find you're ahead of the rest
A future time, a future place
Here on Earth or out in space
The doors are open, come on through
Learn the skills, it's up to you"

The Future—never spoke—
Nor will He—like the Dumb—
Reveal by sign—a syllable
Of His Profound To Come—

Indifference to Him—
The Dower—as the Doom—

Yet every one looks the same
This fashion industry drives me insane
The hip hip kiddies on the street
Thinking that they listen to something new and neat
We are all turning into sheep
Driven by the 'industry'..

All walking wearing the same boring clothes
All using the same products!
A scary future where the industry has run amuck

when we were young and fancy free.
It is a dream I shan’t forget
but will remember happily.
We fell in love and we were wed
together raised a family.
I see the pictures in my head.
My dream was Oh so right to me.
It was a dream that could not be.
We did not meet we did not wed
but yet I hold the memory.
Perhaps  allowed to look ahead
See what in time would come to be.
She married but she was betrayed
I wed and raised a brood of three.
A sad mistake which fate had made.
When we were old and fancy free.
We met as we were meant to do
The fates had reversed their decree.
Brought us together and we knew.
That you were meant to be with me
and I was meant to be with you.
Too late to have a family
I am content just finding you.
Perhaps it’s possible to see
some things which haven’t happened yet
That in due course will come to be.
A vivid dream you can’t forget.
Some sort of future memory.
I only know my dream came true
when you agreed to marry me
I had to wait so long for you.

Living and hoping to still keep you
By my heart and soul – and it's for true,

Upon the fulness of the heart, at last
Saith no grace after meat. My wine hath run
Indeed out of my cup, and there is none
To gather up the bread of my repast
Scattered and trampled ! Yet I find some good
In earth's green herbs, and streams that bubble up
Clear from the darkling ground, -- content until
I sit with angels before better food.
Dear Christ ! when thy new vintage fills my cup,
This hand shall shake no more, nor that wine spill."

Difficult tasks I’ve not shirked,
But at Sixty Two I’ve more years to learn,
And from difficulties, I will not squirm.
But what will I do?
What will I learn?
Will I be happy?
For answers I yearn.
I wish to change my Life,
Be Happy and Well,
Have Peace of Mind,

But change my Life I must,

To hold long chiding conference.
My lusts usurp the present tense
And strangle Reason in his seat.
My loves leap through the future’s fence
To dance with dream-enfranchised feet.
In me the cave-man clasps the seer,
And garlanded Apollo goes
Chanting to Abraham’s deaf ear.
In me the tiger sniffs the rose.
Look in my heart, kind friends, and tremble,
Since there your elements assemble."

Until the final curtain

but it gets closer to me each and every day
Im not sure on what I truly want to be
Everyone around is just confusing me
I promise my family and friends;
I will pursue a career.
But im always getting distracted by my peers.
The things that say seem to always get to me.
But in the future they will eventually see.
They'll see that my hardwork will pay off
They'll be begging my for help on my paid days off
Im smart but at times I refrain to use my brain
If I dont decide to now; Ill go insane.
As Im writing Im thinking about my future life
Whether someday the man of my dreams will call me his wife
So I'd better make up my mind
And prepare for my future! ."

Placed in the Bible, that chapter written last.

~Sir!
I know you are professional at this.
And you have the experience.

Wouldn't it be more economical,
If something more like a tourniquet was used?
The bandages are dwindling.

And I have

Late for the service

But I always fail
On that
That is something
That I need to work on"
903,Emotion,RunningPoemsRunningIndiaPoembyDrYogeshSharma,"A shaky hand on the horn,
Other on the gear.
A ear listening music,
Cell phone in the other ear.
A trembling foot on accelerator,
Other on the clutch,
Unsettled mind and clumsy eyes,
On scantily clad girls.
Welcome to a fast running nation,
Driven by fools and jokers,
On bumpy and dumpy roads,
Pulling the nation for untimely doom.
Sick, secular, tottering leaders,
Salute this deceitful spirit,
Welcome to a nation minus nationalism,
This is the wonder that is India.

If I'd had just one more minute I could have somehow made you mine,
But as it is, im broken and im falling to the ground,
Im weightless, empty, and nothing I say makes a sound.
Baby please tell me that you want me so maybe this writers block will ease.
There was a time I would have told you that without you i cant breathe.
Oh but darling my ego is fragile and its only getting worse.
These easy words and my cruel detachment is my long suffered curse"

windblown there,
some where,
lost in the middle of it?
Whisper then each kiss,
and moreover it wading

907,Emotion,RunningPoemsRunningAwayPoembyneoriddick,"So much anger is about to surface
So much hate. Toleration is deteriorating. Black soul. No soul
Doing for others while they do nothing for me except take.
I won’t give myself to you. You take me while I slumber
Awake now. In the bathroom I see, know, and feel what was done to me
I can say nothing. This I know. All will say it was “invited”. My fault
Dreams flooded with horrid visions. Words are blurred. Let me be
There is no more that I want to see
There is nowhere left for me to be
In my mind, I’m running away from me"
908,Emotion,RunningPoemsSongTheRunningDogsPoembyDavidSmithWhite,"In a land of distant memory,
in the primal world of old,
dog and man were enemies;
and our story should be told.
Beyond the mystic mountain,
lived a pack of hungry hounds;
with a tribe of rustic humans,
who lacked our strength renowned.
A menace to our hunting grounds,
they laid their claim to turf;
and fenced our range to out of bounds,
and stole our birthright, earth.
Our children too were victims,
of eugenic genocide.
The wild spirit of our nature;
broken, tamed, denied.
They call us now the running dogs,
the stunted and the hunted dogs.
They call us now the running dogs,
but are we running scared?
We were once the Big Bad Wolf,
fierce nemesis of cloven hoof.
We patrolled the deep dark wood,
and took the rap for Riding Hood.
We were once a breed to fear,
of sneering breath and snarling leer.
We were threats to little pigs,
and architects in flimsy digs.
But now we lounge on comfy chairs,
grow fat and soft and take on airs.
As trustee to a gaoler's whim,
our savage past must fade and dim.
They call us now the running dogs,
not cunning, merely stunning dogs.
They call us now the running dogs,
but are we running scared?
Running, running, running dogs.
I see and shun those running dogs.
Running, running, running dogs;
the docked and doctored curs.
Running, running, running dogs.
I see no fun in running dogs.
Running, running, running dogs;
till our heaving lungs will burst.
Running, running, running dogs.
And I am done with running dogs.
Running, running, running dogs.
For by that name we're cursed!"
909,Emotion,RunningPoemsRunningAwayPoembyJenniferAlejandra,"Running away
That's what I'll do
Run away,
Away from you
I'll run a million miles
And sail the ocean blue
I'll do anything
To get Away from you
I'll battle a rattle snake
I'll stab it with this stake
I'll do whatever it takes
I'll be out on the street
With nothing to eat
I'll end up probably dead
With an injury on my head
It doesn't matter Because You'll be
Far away from me"

911,Emotion,RunningPoemsBlackDogRunningPoembyRayLucero,"Today while driving a rural road
just a few minutes from my house,
I saw a black dog running toward me on
the right shoulder of the road,
Although it was but a split-second,
the black dog’s eyes met mine…
I asked myself;
Where is he going?
What’s his name?
What’s his purpose?
What does he think about?
What does he feel?
Is the black dog a metaphor for me?
I asked myself:
Where am I going?
What’s my name?
What’s my purpose?
What do I think about?
What do I feel?
Am I a metaphor for the black dog?
How does the black dog help balance nature?
How do I help balance nature?
I then realized,
The black dog and I were,
one and the same!  Two creatures,
defining the present and future in
any given moment with our aliveness!
“Life, not purpose is what really matters”
I glanced at the rear view mirror
and saw the black dog grow
smaller and smaller,
His tail was happily wagging,
and seemed to say…
“Glad to see that you finally get it, Ray”

912,Emotion,RunningPoemsRunningTrackPoembyMichaelBudwah,"Running in a race,
But not the same past,
I wish i could go faster,
But my body wont let me,
Like im tied in chains,
And the pain is to insane,
Running till I fly,
But my wings wont let me,
Like a bird with dislodged wings,
Running In Place,
Even Though Im Comming In Late,
And I bit to much on the plate."
913,Emotion,RunningPoemsRunningFromMyFatePoembyGinaOkafor,"Why do I feel this way always
I always wish to be free and to fly away
I try to get away from my captors
But they catch me every time
I run from depression, sadness and grief
But they catch me every time
They won’t let me go
I have no reason to stay with them
To feel them
But they won’t let me go
They hold me so close I can hardly breathe
Sometimes I think to end it so I will be free
But I realize to be free that way is the end
No way I can be free and experience what I want to that way
I always run towards happiness but I hardly ever reach it
Depression won’t let me go
No one can free me
No one notices my chains
One day I will be free from bondage one way or another"
914,Emotion,RunningPoemsWillieNeenanIsStillRunningPoembyFrancisDuggan,"Willie Neenan is still running as running to him is as much a part of his life
As the lives of his athletic daughters and of Marie his good wife
An Irish champion in his seventies and an Irish champion in his prime
No doubt Millstreet's greatest athlete he's proved that time after time.
Willie Neenan is still running to me that comes as no surprise
He runs in sunny weather and when the rain pours from the skies
He has run in the depths of Winter in the frost and in the snow
Willie Neenan was a champion more than fifty years ago.
He won a World silver medal for Ireland at the Master's Games in San Juan in eighty three
Losing out on gold by the narrowest of margins in his surge for victory
The Pipers band came out to play for him in Millstreet his Hometown
He had proved himself against the World's best cannot keep a good one down.
Willie Neenan is still running his great victories we recall
Of Millstreet's many famous athletes the most famous of them all
He was an Irish champion when I was a schoolboy
And he will go on running until the day he die."

To leave all my worries behind,

I thought about running away today,
How could I get there fast?
I thought about running away today,
That plan didnt last.
I am going to run away today,
I've had enough of my life here,
Packed my bags to run away today,
Didn't go because of fear.
I got up and ran away today,
Jumped on a train to Waterloo,
But while I was away today,
I realised I missed you.

Even though I wont be home today,
Remember, I love you!"

Knotted strings and fishing-hooks
Of the truant, stealing down
Weedy backways of the town.
Where the sunshine overlooks,
By green fields and running brooks,
All intruding guests of chance
With a golden tolerance,
Cooing doves, or pensive pair
Of picnickers, straying there--
By green fields and running brooks,
Sylvan shades and mossy nooks!
And--O Dreamer of the Days,
Murmurer of roundelays
All unsung of words or books,
Sing green fields and running brooks!"
919,Emotion,RunningPoemsTheRunningManPoembyStephanieBlodgett,"You can’t always run you know
Ghosts of the past will always fallow
It doesn’t really matter where you go
Just know that they will eat you hollow
You can’t always leave everyone behind
It’s within yourself what you need to find
You may run all day
You could run all night
You can never just say
You don’t put up a fight
I really don’t see why
You live just waiting to die
Where is it you think your doing to?
Far away to start anew
When are these days going to be though?
Take a step back and look at you…
Ho w do you think happiness is made
What do you think trust is?
Is it smoking out and getting laid?
Maybe you’d know if you stayed
To not run and learn to deal
To rest up and have a place to heal
You can’t spend your life running you know
The road ahead is always so long
Past lives aren’t that easy to let go
Don’t run away till your forever gone"

923,Emotion,RunningPoemsStopRunningWildPoembyMichaelPJohnson,"We act so proud we play the fool
We walk as though asleep
Yet bend and often break each rule
The Lord would have us keep
If we were parent of a child
Who plays the worldly clown
Would we reward for running wild?
Or would we wear a frown?
Some think The Lord should spare the rod
Should pity when we cry
But God in truth would not be God
If He’d just watch us die
Our God is Father of us all
He hates to see man fail
It hurts to see His children fall
And burn in Satan’s jail
So God will beat and God will chide
Till truth we’ve come to see
His eyes will wander far and wide
To set His servants free
Our father loves us to a fault
He seeks His children’s cure
He’ll season each proving salt
Until our lives are pure
He’ll spare no woman man or child
He’ll trouble heart and soul
Until we all are reconciled
And made completely whole
Consider it joy tests and trials
Persevere them well
We’ll live to wear eternal smiles
Whilst Satan burns in hell"
924,Emotion,RunningPoemsAPubCalledRunningBullPoembySamEdison,"After 15 shots of whiskey I puked right on the floor
Asked the bartender for another he said dont come back no more
And then the mutant bouncers they grabbed me off my feet
I barely put up a struggle as they threw me out onto the street
Threw a rock right at there window and vomited once more
I stumbled fell and crawled untill I bumped into this whore
She said now sugar you dont look so good would you like to see my pink
I said well maybe later but for now I need something to drink
She pointed in the direction of a pub called running bull
They'll pump you up with whiskey till your livers completely full
With a prayer up to Saint Mary I made it miraculosly to the door
And when that door had opened I seen something Ive never seen before
I seen angels devils and lizards sharing bottles and singing song
Each and every bottle was a Jameson so I knew that I belong
I ordered a shot of Jameson the shot glass was as big as my head
I asked if I died and went to heaven they said no son your not dead
You had made it to your new favorite pub a place called running bull
The only pub in new york city that will have your liver full"

Run to avoid tears falling
Run and doesn’t care where to go
Run till your knees breaking
Do you ever run?
Run with all determination
Run to reach the sky
Run and try to catch the lack of time
Run till everything blurred into one
Do you ever run?
Run from all your fear
Run further away abandoning the world
Run and never turn back again
Run till the darkness swallowing"

927,Emotion,RunningPoemsAddictedToRunningPoembyFrancisDuggan,"At least he's not causing pollution of him that would be fair to say
He runs to the work yard in the morning and back home at the end of the day
A distance of some twelve kilometres that is six kilometres each way
A fitness fanatic and a hard working fellow for him never an easy pay.
Wearing running road shoes and shorts and a light vest he carries his working gear in his backpack
He runs to the work yard every morning and after work to home runs back
A man in his thirties with a wife and teenage daughters he is a few years past his prime
He never does work at the weekends and he never does work overtime.
One who has run in many marathons and he always finishes his race
his last marathon was his best finish just beaten by the winner into second place
Still he is one I do not envy and him I've no wish to emulate
I could not push myself like he does I have no desire to be great.
Just before daybreak in the morning he is one you are bound to meet
He runs to his workplace in the Suburbs on the sidewalk from street to street
To running he does seem addicted he works hard and he runs every day
Whilst others in their their beds are sleeping through the suburbs to works he jogs his way."
928,Emotion,RunningPoemsWhenLikeARunningGravePoembyDylanThomas,"When, like a running grave, time tracks you down,
Your calm and cuddled is a scythe of hairs,
Love in her gear is slowly through the house,
Up naked stairs, a turtle in a hearse,
Hauled to the dome,
Comes, like a scissors stalking, tailor age,
Deliver me who timid in my tribe,
Of love am barer than Cadaver's trap
Robbed of the foxy tongue, his footed tape
Of the bone inch
Deliver me, my masters, head and heart,
Heart of Cadaver's candle waxes thin,
When blood, spade-handed, and the logic time
Drive children up like bruises to the thumb,
From maid and head,
For, sunday faced, with dusters in my glove,
Chaste and the chaser, man with the cockshut eye,
I, that time's jacket or the coat of ice
May fail to fasten with a virgin o
In the straight grave,
Stride through Cadaver's country in my force,
My pickbrain masters morsing on the stone
Despair of blood faith in the maiden's slime,
Halt among eunuchs, and the nitric stain
On fork and face.
Time is a foolish fancy, time and fool.
No, no, you lover skull, descending hammer
Descends, my masters, on the entered honour.
You hero skull, Cadaver in the hangar
Tells the stick, 'fail.'
Joy is no knocking nation, sir and madam,
The cancer's fashion, or the summer feather
Lit on the cuddled tree, the cross of fever,
Not city tar and subway bored to foster
Man through macadam.
I dump the waxlights in your tower dome.
Joy is the knock of dust, Cadaver's shoot
Of bud of Adam through his boxy shift,
Love's twilit nation and the skull of state,
Sir, is your doom.
Everything ends, the tower ending and,
(Have with the house of wind), the leaning scene,
Ball of the foot depending from the sun,
(Give, summer, over), the cemented skin,
The actions' end.
All, men my madmen, the unwholesome wind
With whistler's cough contages, time on track
Shapes in a cinder death; love for his trick,
Happy Cadaver's hunger as you take
The kissproof world."
929,Emotion,RunningPoemsTheDogRunningPoembySadiqullahKhan,"In thunderstorm, and a grey dog
A dog always tied, and in chain
But in thunderstorm, roaring
The dog is running, struck by fear
Enters the room, and under the bed
Pushes himself, places his head on his claws
The grey skin and fur of the dog
Keeper of the house, and near the door
A shepherd hound, loyal to the house
Men and women, children and animals
The dogs tail, cut but still long
And ears straight, eyes dark
I remember the dog, a friend old
When I was a child, and the village simple
My verse is simple, as simple as dog
I wish I had a dog like him, a friend of worth
The many things I mourn and the day’s happenings
But today, my dog I mourn you and remember you"

And I love my phone calls too
But now I have this special place
To come and visit with all of you
I can take the extra time in here
To say it with a poem or rhyme
To sit and think what's in my soul
Where I am not hurried for time
Things I would never say in person
For it's easier to say in written words
Because you my internet friends
Have heard what no one else has heard
I can come to you with anything
No matter how silly, real or unreal
You're always there to show you care
And just let me express how I feel
It seems it is easier to talk to you
Than with any one else that I know
For I can let my guard down here
And let all of my emotions show
So I thank you all for being here
And I count you as treasured friends
I hope I will always be here for you
And I pray this kinship never ends"
932,Emotion,RunningPoemsRunningWithWolvesPoembyEvanSkora,"Trapped in submission,
Sumberged in this condition,
Trapped in a shell,
I wish I could quell.
To be free is a dream,
To have what I desire is a wish.
Where can I go,
Where will this path lead,
From this shell I'll never grow,
From this body I won't stop to bleed.
Running with wolves,
An impossible dream,
A most wanted wish.
This shell hiding the beast inside,
I walk in skin,
He talks to me as a guide,
He is my friend, my opposite, my twin.
For him to break free,
What a day that would be,
Until...I abide,
Always there yet he hides inside.
The burning sensation,
To howl,
To run,
To feel the fascination.
Though I feel no fur,
Scratch no claws,
Run no forest,
Howl no song.
My dreams keep me in fascination,
They drive the sensation,
The wolf inside keeps me alive,
The running of the wolves makes me thrive."

My heart beat very fast
Soon our eyes met each other
We were both back in the past
It was many years ago
When we were young and free
I though the sun rose in her eyes
She though she was in love with me
We were so very happy
Together doing our thing
Bothering with no one else
Just reading the I Ching
But as the years passed us
We both moved on
Each going our own way
The feelings were long gone
I hadn’t thought of her in years
But now she stands before me
The days and years that have gone by
Have helped to make me see
We passed the time with small talk
But soon it was time to leave
What I once wanted so badly
Turned out to be what I didn’t need

Of unwary Summer, it stealthily seals
Small changes in heavily leaf-laden trees.
Summer fruits begin dropping, balanced astride
Branches festooned, in which Autumn takes hide
Before battle commences it's shivery breeze
Which scatters browned leaves, to bring to their knees
Beaten down Summer days of warm ease.
Autumn comes running, nor waits to abide
While brave Summer blooms adjust to it's ride.
It tosses, relentless, all 'Summer' it sees
Havocing treetops, nor does it allay
It's mischievous goadings for yet one more day.
Scurrying birds sense each warning of chill.
Consistently peck around my window-sill,
Fattening on seeds before temperatures freeze.
Autumn comes running
To stay."

more of the same

Exhaling at last...

They threw a halfpenny into my cap.
For I am running to paradise;
And all that I need do is to wish
And somebody puts his hand in the dish
To throw me a bit of salted fish:
And there the king is but as the beggar.
My brother Mourteen is worn out
With skelping his big brawling lout,
And I am running to paradise;
A poor life, do what he can,
And though he keep a dog and a gun,
A serving-maid and a serving-man:
And there the king is but as the beggar.
Poor men have grown to be rich men,
And rich men grown to be poor again,
And I am running to paradise;
And many a darling wit's grown dull
That tossed a bare heel when at school,
Now it has filled a old sock full:
And there the king is but as the beggar.
The wind is old and still at play
While I must hurty upon my way.
For I am running to paradise;
Yet never have I lit on a friend
To take my fancy like the wind
That nobody can buy or bind:
And there the king is but as the beggar."
944,Emotion,RunningPoemsARunningManFoxBitterGrapesPoembynimaldunuhinga,"He is running or a limping walk?
How far he runs?
He is tired and stopped!
And how long he could wait?
Promises are like gas-balloons in the sky.
He straightens a rickety ladder and climbs the greasy steps carefully
To pluck the cluster grapes.
A run away rabies infected fox pulls the ladder and cries down;
'Life is nothing but only a fistful of bitter grapes.'
To my dear friend Jerry for his promising health and also to Max.Reif and Dennis.Joe of their lull.

945,Emotion,RunningPoemsc35LifePhilosophyRunningAwayPoembyRenuRakhejaakaTranquilOcean,"My soul wants to fly away
Riding on a brilliant ray
To a land of oblivion
Where Im known by no one
Just live my life in peace
No one to hurt no one to please
Away from the complexities
That this life brings to its crease
But then I think why run away
The road does get rough in its way
But it also streteches out in a straight road
It may be long but you do reach your  abode
As long as you dont hurt anyone knowingly
Absorb the ride, its highs and lows in totality
Pain is a part of the road and will make you realize
Feel it, endure it and it will help you rise"
946,Emotion,RunningPoemsRunningAroundInCirclesPoembyDavidHarris,"There are days when you feel
you are going to get so much done.
So much for good intentions.
When you start to get
the old run around.
It seems that life
is going around in circles.
What started as a lead ahead
now has you thirty yards behind.
You feel like you should have stayed in bed
and got up the other side,
but you don’t.
Instead, you persevere
to go running round in circles
all the day long.

947,Emotion,RunningPoemsRunningBarefootPoembyLauryPerez,"I run
Barefoot and cold
Wanting to go where nobody has ever gone
To the moon or maybe even the stars
They all seem so far
But I'll find the right Place
Where I'll sit and wait
And hope and pray
That all these bad thoughts will go away
But I highly doubt it,
Because these memories are here to stay,
Untill they go black and fade away"

And I'm running from my cries.
I'm running from my friends,
And I'm running from my life.
Everyone I've hurt,
And everyone whose cared.
Everyone whose tried,
And everyone whose dared.
Everything I've done,
And every time I've tried.
Everything I've said,
And every time I've cried.
As I run into the dark,
As I run from the light.
Who will guide me through?
And who will make this right?
Why should I stop?
Why should I slow down?
When all that waits for me,
Is a lonely heart that's drowned.
So who am I?
What have I become?
But a stranger in the night,
A man who is on the run.
Who will care?
And who will try?
Who will understand?
And who will just walk by?
As the rain rolls in,
And every ones in bed,
I'm out on this road,
And I'm walking straight ahead."
949,Emotion,RunningPoemsRunningIsNotASolutionPoembyBiancaFree,"Running away isn't as easy as it seems.
There's no deserted mountain waiting when you come,
no peaceful fountain to drink from.
The stars won't be convenient at night,
they won't lead you down by the river to rest.
The hanging moon won't be fluoresced.
No, running away is no means of escape,
it will only bring you closer to fear and failure.
Those who want to get away from their problems
must never run away, but learn to endure."
950,Emotion,RunningPoemsRunningAmokPoembyNickCarbo,"In the slums of Tondo, people dwell
in shacks of cardboard, bits of bamboo,
corrugated metal, and a few cement blocks.
They come from all the provinces--
a farmer’s son from Cagayan,
a coal miner from Bulacan,
a field hand from the banana plantations
of Davao. They come to Manila
for work, for better pay.
The highest incidence of men
running amok is in Tondo,
or at least, that’s what the local tabloids
have for headlines every week. Amok in Tondo
kills seven! Police shoot him to death!
During the Filipino-American War
from 1900 to 1902, the Colt .45 pistol
was refined to kill crazed
Moro fighters who ran amok
and would not stop attacking
with rabid animal urgency
when shot with bullets of lesser caliber.
The superstitious old women in Tondo say
that no rice, no shoes, and no work
breed beetles and violence.
They say that small black beetles
can lay eggs in a man’s ear,
and this is what makes a man run."
951,Emotion,RunningPoemsRunningMatePoembyLawrenceSPertillar,"She's shallow and easily programmed.
And maybe that has something to do
With the size of the state she represents.
And that's not sexist at all.

Her eyes aren't as focused.
In fact...
There seems to be deception hidden behind them!
As they seem to be when she repeats her beefed up resumé.
Making her the obvious choice he could have made,
As a running mate!
Moderate or conservative...
Or whatever those folks call themselves today.
'Right wingers who aren't liberal.
You know...
Those who pack guns, hunt and race cars.
And talk about how patriotic they are.
With isolated values,
They insist should be everyone's standard for life.'"

*They prepare for the conventions coming up.*
~Well...
They seem to represent the people.
Nothing will get done.
And the one who wants to do that,
Will be labelled a liberal.
And those conservative will say...
The country is too far left!
And those on the right are religiously opposed! ~
*Remember those days,
When the choice made was just to vote?
Now you have these folks,
Who claim to represent our causes...
And protect our well being and quality of life!
Now they want us to believe they are running for 'sainthood'.
And those with the lesser of clipped wings...
Will deliver all our needs,
Tax free!
And we are going to be foolish enough...
Not to see through this crap they've got us trapped in! '"
953,Emotion,RunningPoemsRunningPoembyLauraCummings,"Running away from adulthood,
Being chased by points of authority,
Not understanding,
Still seeing and hearing to much for innocent eyes,
Running away from adulthood,
Being rushed, being pushed into adulthood,
I dont feel ready,
Being chased by points of authority,
I dont know what I'm thinking,
I have no plan,
No organisation,
No hope,
Im just running away from adulthood,
Doing anything to push back the moment when,
I have to grow up,
I dont feel ready,
Being watched by over observant eyes,
Waiting for my ultimate slip up,
The slip that will give reality leave to,
Kick me in the teeth,
Nothing has changed,
I falter,
I fall,
As you can see,
Nothings changed at all,
I run from adulthood,
i get chased by points of authority,
Getting rushed, getting pushed into adulthood,
Being forced to 'grow up! '
Im not ready,
I dont want to take this step,
Its much to big,
And yet,
When i am being over parented,
Trapped by points of authority,
Trapped in situations that i cant be bothered with,
I welcome adulthood with open arms,
But im still not ready."
954,Emotion,RunningPoemsSheWasRunningLatePoembymestuppoems,"She was running late. Her family had crossed the road ahead of her and now out of sight. Normally they would have waited, but today was just not a normal day and they were all looking forward to a restful night.
It was her running late that made her careless. It’s amazing how we forget to do the things we teach our kids. She ran right into the road without a single glance. She didn’t even see the late model pickup that didn’t see her until it was too late.
Things weren’t right for a few moments. She wasn’t sure what happened – one moment she was crossing the road chasing her family and the next she was laying on it. Why couldn’t she move her arms and legs? Why couldn’t she feel anything?
Help! ? !
Help! ? – did she really just say that out loud?
Was someone coming? Yes! A man was coming closer. All she could do was lift her head up to look at him. That’s strange. Why was he carrying a rifle? Who was he talking to on the cell phone?
The next to last thing she heard was the driver of the truck telling his wife that he would be late. He had hit a deer on the road and needed to put her out of her misery."

Inside those pumping talks,

The moon is climbing above the fir,
The lane is crowded with creeping shadows,
The gorse is only a distant blur;
The last of the light is almost gone,
But hark! They're running!
They're running on !
The count of the years is steadily growing;
The Old give way to the eager Young;
Far on the hill is the horn still blowing,
Far on the steep are the hounds still strung.
Good men follow the good men gone;
And hark! They're running!
They're running on!"

in the front I hopped
She said: The Busses are running late
I just stared, then asked for a date.
She said: 'sure tonight at eight',
I thought, 'great she took the bait'
So after work, I ran home and got ready

waiting on the bus to hop

Locking the door behind him,
They were amazed to discover him...
Laughing and swinging on the swing,
In the backyard!
They could not sleep at night...
Even medicated!
Why?
They questioned!
Why is he doing 'this' to US?
And no one thought to change the locks!
And 'he' had the key!
He also owned the house and the property!
And he knew...
They were living on borrowed time!
His!
They believed they were doing him a favor,
By gracing him with 'their' presence!
And he enjoyed them not knowing...
He was running out of patience!"

Something we once did live

Here in this rainy time season
A wish for a four leaved clover
Comes without knowing its reason
Gardens of Eden are falling
With every known passion inside
Loneliness to feelings calling
Where every doubt must hide

Giving no touch of their own
In twilight these days seem
Dim shallow moods their gown
Pass this away from my instance
Give me daybreak to know
There is always a second chance
Come to me herewith and grow"

Do not procrastinate;
Regret, amend, repent;
Receive the grace of God.
Restart a life anew;
Live life meaningfully;
Live in the fear of God;
Decide eternity.
The devils are a losing lot;
The Maker knows their every plot;
He knows our weaknesses, bad thoughts;
To save our souls, we ought
Our earthly life is transient;
He knows our strife- Omniscient;
The Son of God has opened gates
Of Heaven and lovingly waits
For every soul, He made with love,
To enter His abode above!"

It’s your infectious laugh, and your uncried tears.
All your wishes and all your dreams,
being smothered by your static screams.
He holds, in a package under his arm,
your spark, your wit, your fun and charm.
All bundled up, and wrapped with a bow,
as you just stand and watch it go.
Everything stolen - over and done,
Desperate to save it, but you just can’t run.
He rounds the corner, your world goes dark,
a disposable lighter, unable to spark.
That dark figure running –
Sprinting ahead – is not your friend.
It was your future."

Hoping for a good future
Tears in her eyes
Running to the preacher
Asking for advice in the end gaining none
Shes a fearful polar bear sitting in the sun
Trying to hurry and get on with life
She hates the attention, but loves to tell lies
Tries to make things better
But they only turn out worse
The role she's been playing
Plenty a' times rehearsed
Moot is her thinking
Testy is her soul
This running girl is running trying to find her fairy tale
And everyone is screaming
Wait look back at what you've missed
You've tried to zoom thru life not even pausing for a kiss
You're children are grown
You're husband in a nursing home
You all alone
Afraid to answer the telephone
Scared of love and afraid of being touched
Raped and abused in her past
Told she was worth to none
A running girl who never stop's to see who she has hurt
She never planned out her dreams
Always told she was dirt
Wrinkles in her face
Yet she still thinks she's twenty-one
Running girl stop running
Your shoes cant go on
You always wanted a mother
A father just to hold
A house she'd always stay in
No bags to pack and move
All she ever knew was how to run
She never looked away from her path
Never gazed up at the sun
Her children needed her but she struggled
to make it thru the day
Running girl slow down and listen to what your family has to say
Go see your husband and call your children too
Stop running, running girl
You cant afford another pair of shoes"

lone highway, it is hot
and lots of inner strength on tap
a marathon it's not.
Those training runs I used to do
in early morning cool
and never wear a single shoe
some neighbours call me fool.
Thick fog one day. I could not see
the houses as I passed
my energy was running free
inside, though, I was gassed.
That barbecue with chilli beans
and Weihenstephan beer
had given me (through carbs)  the means
to run in seventh gear.
But, beans explode and leave behind
the puff of fifty dragons
on contact insects do go blind
the sound is like Volkswagens.
In front of a most stately home
a thunderbolt shot out
it scared a handsome garden gnome
and there she stood, a Kraut!
'Zo, doo yoo ssink it helps yoo runn
much faaster ssroo ze bresher? '
'Oh no', I said it is pure fun
and after I feel fresher.'
She nodded then, as if to think
when, once again, it blew
I gave a small but playful wink
as if I had a clou.
A cloud had formed around the place
I made my get-away
a crimson red was on my face
I could no longer stay.
With all the speed at my command
I sprinted through the fog
Behind, the words 'I underschdand

Is like a little robin’s song, winsome,
Or as two white butterflies settle in the cup of one flower
For a moment, then away with a flutter of wings.
I long for the baby to wander hither to me
Like a wind-shadow wandering over the water,
So that she can stand on my knee
With her little bare feet in my hands,
Cool like syringa buds,
Firm and silken like pink young peony flowers."

Wind whipping like pain through your heart,
Unable to stand, unable to sit.

Silent footsteps trace your route
Through the darkness you're running on foot.
SIlently floating the followers are.
They know why you're running and they know where you are.
You've ran so far
Yet you've ran so little.
You'll never escape so don't even try.
The followers know where your planning to hide.
Bury them deep but they will come back.
The longer you ignore them the harder they'll track;
Along the roads to follow you,
Floating around you in everything you do.
Yet I'm still running in the darkness
Running through the night.
Running out the pain
Running without a light."
985,Emotion,RunningPoemsRunningTheRaceOfLifePoembyCynthiaBuhainBaello,"As we run this finite race of life
To the finish line in swiftness of soul,
We undress ourselves of the baggage of strife
Take love in our steps to reach our goal.
Forgetting whatever lies behind
We set our hearts on the eternal price
Fixing our eyes on Jesus we find
His strength and power in us will arise.
As we number our days like fleeting mist
And our frailty of body declaring
The end line maybe right here in our midst
Our life may be in for a proper accounting.
For Death like a Thief always comes uninvited
And will cut through the race with his sickle
The call may come quick and be quite unexpected
Taking us suddenly out of the hurdle.
So let go of all sin and feelings of hate,
Be free of desires for material things,
Release and forgive before it's too late
The hourglass of life goes on emptying.
For the brevity of life is but a single breath
And we all will take flight as a bird
A destiny set for men to meet Death
Running only on the promise of God's Word.
'Show me, O Lord, my life's end
and the number of my days;
let me know how fleeting is my life.
You have made my days a mere handbreath;
the span of my years mean nothing to You.
Each man's life is but a breath.'
Psalm 39: 4-5

987,Emotion,RunningPoemsRunningWolfPoembyDaveAlanWalker,"In my dream
I dream I am you
running wolf
As you run through
the valleys of truth
I see the dew
I see the trees
as though I am you
I see through your eyes
I feel your fears
I feel your heart beating
I see indians dancing
round fires of peace
I see the fears
of what the white man brings
I see peace and harmony
and a place for me
Running wolf
one of truth
why is there a place for me
Because my light and soul
I am the reincarnation of you"
988,Emotion,RunningPoemsRunningGamePoembyLawrenceSPertillar,"Running game.
As if this lame routine
Isn't known or seen,
For what it is!
From one door stop to another
This practice has no depth,
Or sincerety upon its delivery.
It just travels to be played.
Amazing those who watch
Others allowing it to continue,
With supportive encouragement...
And donated loyalty!
There is nothing in it for them at all.
It has become tradition...
And that matters more than substance!"
989,Emotion,RunningPoemsRunningChasingPoembyMichaelPJohnson,"The world we know is far from free
Her children live in fear
We’ve lost The Truth and fail to see
The reason why we’re here
We’re running here we’re chasing there
Searching both night and day
Whilst God has Heaven’s wealth to share
With those who Christ obey
But who can see the facts displayed
Or hear The Master’s voice
Why is the heart and soul dismayed
When darkness stays our choice
Like fools we choose satanic wares
Through lust we seek self-gain
When trapped within life’s evil snares
We let the devil reign
So now God’s voice is seldom heard
Where lies have filled the mind
We listen to our neighbour’s word
Who self is lost and blind
Not always is it Satan’s blame
As in the past believed
We choose ourselves a life of shame
Claiming we were deceived
No liar’s reach The Promised Land
No sin from God can hide
We need The Truth to understand
Why Jesus came and died
We must repent from walking dead
Return to life once more
Rise up from Satan’s lustful bed
And lock to him our door"

not now
this cant be happening to me
its chasing me
the shadow gets closer
i look into it
i see the red eyes
the horns
i must run
death is after me
its too early
my life has been so short
its only started to get good
ive experienced so little
now i'm at the mercy of this beast
i must escape
i try to run
but my legs tire fast
my will fades
then i trip
i break my shin on a rock
the pain
it burns like if i were thrown into the sun
blood runs from my leg
pours all over the ground
i look back
the beast is still chasing me
i get up
i feel my bones shift inside my leg
it tears my flesh
i fall back down
i can no longer feel half my leg
it only hangs off of a bit of skin
lifelessly
i cant just sit here
the beast is coming
its getting closer
tears running from my cheeks
i fear that this may be it
i feel myself growing weak
but i must continue
i try to crawl
pain surging through my body with every movement
no!
i scrape my chest on a sharp rock
death still charging at me
my wounds pour out even more blood
i cant avoid it
death is racing toward me
i sob in tears
my face covered in scarlet
i lie helplessly
i think over my life
look for a good memory
i try to make my last breath last
but pain is too strong
my chest pain burns with intensity
then somehow
my body bursts into flames
the sky rains fire
my hands burn with rage
i cannot put them out
pain so terrible
i weep at the sight of my wounds
the beast is almost near
my hope fades away
my passions are obliterated
i cant stop the beast
my hands turn to ash
the fire now burns my bones
the fire creeps up my arms
my leg pours out blood
my heart is failing
i lie helplessly
in pain as death creeps up on me
i try to scream
but blood creeps into my throat
and i choke, and cough
i cannot breathe
i turn my head to the side
i see something
i try to focus in
i see a light
a beautiful light
so beautiful
as the beast takes my life
i look upon this beauty in awe
and i feel completed
i am ready..."
993,Emotion,RunningPoemsTimesRunningOutPoembyMichaelPJohnson,"As less on earth seek truth above
As fewer people care
So rare becomes fragrance of love
While lust pollutes the air
Lust for silver for gold and jewels
For neighbour’s wares and wives
Lust to serve as Satan’s tools
Cursing and ruining lives
But who has faith enough to hear?
Who’s wise enough to see?
Knowledge enough The Lord to fear
And live by Royal decree
How will Jesus greet His bride?
Faithful wealthy and well
Or will she run and seek to hide?
Down life’s dark road to hell
Just as Adam had done before
As Eve bowed down to shame
We close to God and life our door
Denying Jesus’ name
Denying truth of Heaven’s Seed
Author of life and light
Cultivating satanic weed
Walking in ways contrite
Sinking to depths before unknown
As expert in the shade
Denying still The Royal Throne
Of Him through whom we’re made
Will God forgive who’ve misbehaved?
Each wayward wanton crime
Through Jesus Christ the way’s well paved
Yet only whilst there’s time"
994,Emotion,RunningPoemsRunningDeepPoembyFaySlimm,"Deep as my love runs so runs yours too.
Caught at the point of the centre, our hearts,
Beating deep, retreat further as true
Love and devotion merge. No more apart,
Our souls meld, then reappear, fired as one.
We are the same, identical aims run
Along a joined vein of life. Desires become
Cemented in needs of the other. Some
Days the pulsing of you fills my spirit
With rivers of longing. When will you come
And claim what's your own?  I must inhibit
The joy of that day, but as summer shone
Bright over my clouded life then, so  rain
Your love deep, flood me with sunshine again."
995,Emotion,RunningPoemsDrDeathIsRunningForCongressPoembyJoeRosochacki,"Dr. Death, aka Jack Kevorkian, is running for congress,
He is running for the 9th District seat in Michigan,
The incumbent Republican,
Joe Knollenberg to unseat
Jack is 79, and he looks like death warmed over,
He’ll be lucky to make to November,
He has to have 3,000 signatures for his name to be put on the ballot,
To bad he assisted suicides in many of his supporters,
-at least 130 of them.
His lawyer, Mayer Morganroth, is mum on the word,
His previous lawyer, Geoffery Feiger,
Argued that the society did not have The Knack to follow Dr. Death’s thinking.
They Shoot Horses Don’t They?
Was the contention.
Maybe he can assist the Democratic Party its fray,
To lead to a new direction.
They seem destined for a self destruct convention.

996,Emotion,RunningPoemsRunningSuicidePoembyKelseyJoe,"A silent tear falls to the ground
She hides in her place, not making a sound.
Grief had invaded her body for years
And now it was time for her to face her fears.
She cut her wrists and covered her eyes
And whispered that today was the day she dies.
She stared at herself through the glass
Then punched the mirror to get rid of her past.
The glass fell softly onto the floor
She stared at her fist then ran out the door.
She ran down the hallway really fast
But she could not run away from her past.
After thinking, she gave up on life
She went to the room and got a knife.
She said her goodbyes as she took one last breath
Then slit her throat deep and the blood surrounded her death.
One thing that girl should have known
Is that she would be dead and alone.
And that you can’t escape death or life,
In that one spot where her blood stays on the knife.
So where there is a silent tear
And where there is blood to shed
She will be there to put their misery
To An End"
997,Emotion,SometimesPoemsSometimesIWonderPoembyHelenBridgesWilliams,"Sometimes I wonder why I feel I
what I feel
whether it is pain, sadness,
joy or madness
Why must I feel it all so deeply
emotions on a never ending
circle filled with blue and gray
Light trickling in at its own
convenience to play
Is this the destiny for which we
create our won existence or can
we change the circles to squares
Triangles or octagons
with a brighter beginnings and
visible ends
A life with meaning
pleasurable and rewarding
Without oppression, suggestion
or reprimand
Is this the reality of the
Conclusion of our lives
or merely the beginning of
destiny."
998,Emotion,SometimesPoemsSometimesIWonderWhyPoembyElaineOxamendiVicet,"Unrequited Love
Sometimes I wonder why I go on loving you
This way…
Words of a song that is a recurring decimal to me.
On my return from an extended visit I became ill
The cure was lie with my parents
74 & 75
To feel secure and comfortable.
This is gnawing feeling
To be secure and comfortable.
To know that someone cares for me the way I do
At 32 up to 74 and more.
Why do I go on feeling this way? ....
The embrace of an arm at night
The warmth that emanates from glances
The gentle touches as hands brush when we pass.
The silence shared
The bickering
The share power of communicating.
Still I wonder why, I go on loving you this way.
Each day another test
Each day another life time moment lost.
Each day life grows shorter
Each day I long for this lover.
My throat/chokes
My eyes swell
I am full
Little streams flow
Once again
When will this be over?
I want 32 to 74 and more.
The beauty I see
I witness
Between 74,75
Love between my parents is better than …..(sign)
I don’t really wonder why I go on feeling this way
It’s love.
But is it UNREQUITED LOVE?
It’s like a recurring decimal
I fall between the cracks
Just another sad song
Drinking up the night in a lonely room
So the songwriter says
I say
ENOUGH
I Want More
We deserve to grow old together"

I don't know
It's just love inside this
I'll have to show - have to show
Everybody is doing something
And I just know how to sing
Love is sometimes crazy
When it comes to me
And my thoughts get hazy
When they are set to be
Questions asked never are
What they sometimes seem
Everything stays afar
Like a delusional dream
Don't ask me why - I can't tell you
I don't have the answers
There are no certainties to go to
I often have a dream to feel my way
But dreams don't live to become true
I'll make decisions that are up to me
And give the dreams I know
I'll try to be what I can be
In times that come and go
Love is sometimes crazy
When it comes to me
And my thoughts get hazy
When they are set to be
Questions asked never are
What they sometimes seem
Everything stays afar
Like a delusional dream
Don't ask me why -
Love is sometimes crazy
I can't tell you any lie
I can't tell you any lie
Love is sometimes crazy
When it comes to me
And my thoughts get hazy
When they are set to be

Everything stays afar
Like a delusional dream
Love is sometimes crazy
But gives so much
We are sometimes crazy
And out of touch
Sometimes crazy
And out of touch

Stuck inside this love that once was free
Reaching to gray skies up high
Filling empty spaces that surrounds
Living for hours that die
Into the dreams that shall on fly
Onto the giving of notions that mounds
I felt I had somewhere to reach out and contact
Bring in those longings that age had blacked
Something once ready even if still in its intact
Living its emptiness that nothing could enact
Reaching to gray skies up high
Filling empty spaces that surrounds
Living for hours that die
Into the dreams that shall on fly
Onto the giving of notions that mounds
Oh sometimes I feel I’m lost there somewhere
A dream in dim mislaid without its day prayer
With only behaviors no one could prepare
Always so unfilled and always so unfair

I am buried in my sheets and unwilling to acknowledge you
Stubborn Daemon, you both bring and maculate dreams of her
Her face is lost somewhere between lucid and wake
What good are hollowed prophecies?
No sustenance, and nothing to gain
Only a frantic assurance that I one day will meet-
Her.
In passing, a glimpse will sop a tear
And I will hold her hand
A crowded street
The busiest marketplace
A solitary trail
Her, deserving of all my infinite kisses
I am aware of your labor and order
Know that I will love and hate you until I am gone
But promise me, dark shadow, now perched on splintered rafter
That you will not cease to bring me madness
You bring hope, ardent hope."

of some Medusas and cyclops
and dragons
do not deny the nerves and veins
of the devil still clinging
to our flesh, running and so alive
we have all these sometimes
like some storms and tornadoes
and flash floods and
volcanic eruptions and
tsunamis.... the forces of nature
tattooed in our skins
stained in our brains
just give me time
while i write the poetry of anger, and madness and
hate,
do not even wait as i simmer down to indifference
leave me alone
in my destructive destinations
wait, and wait some more
if you have love at all,
let me go, let me vent, let me shout, let me explode
for tonight
when the moon is full, i lay tired on the grass by the
tranquil pool,
still trees, cool but undisturbed by any ripple
when all these pass,
come, share a drink with me
come, let us again talk in whispers
then some smiles
then a loud laughter

We must fail in order to know

To raise that unwanted we want the world of happiness

Perfect was not the one who came first
But that same one whom strived for the best

We've dodged another bullet.
We're given one more day.

to not forget to say...
Your breath comes forth just for me,
your lungs still rise and fall.
I'll always be beside you

The heat from you while sleeping

No one. Sometimes, only sometimes.
And sometimes I am what I appear to be
Sometimes, only sometimes.
Sometimes I see what you can not see.
Sometimes, only sometimes.
Sometimes I'm the fool
Sometimes I'm the tool
Sometimes I believe what I can not percieve is cool
As do you.
Sometimes, only sometimes
Though my actions and thoughts may be erratic
They are but as nature intended
Inspiration, emotion, both love and devotion
My sometimes, become mended
And in the joining is formed a spirit as pure as the Gods do allow
As threads we connect and our sometimes reflect our here, our forever, our now."
1020,Emotion,SometimesPoemsSometimesWhenIMDreamingPoembyLindaOri,"Sometimes when I'm dreaming..........
My world is bright and clear -
I know my heart,
I know my part,
No hesitance or fear;
Sometimes when I'm dreaming..........
I wander through the night -
To distant lands,
I grasp the hands
Of poverty and plight;
Sometimes when I'm dreaming..........
I have the power to cure -
The weak of heart,
Lives torn apart,
My faith is strong and pure;
Sometimes when I'm dreaming..........
The answers come to light -
Which path to take,
Which choice to make,
No question which is right;
Sometimes when I'm dreaming..........
I feel you standing near -
You calm my storm,
Your heart is warm,
Your love for me is clear;
Sometimes when I'm dreaming..........
I just enjoy the view -
I'm in my space,
My perfect place,
That's when I dream of you."
1021,Emotion,SometimesPoemsSometimesPoembyDavidDaykin,"Sometimes I do not know where I am going.
Sometimes I have no idea where I have been.
Sometimes life is all about the knowing.
And I wonder will I ever win.
Sometimes this road it feels so long.
Sometimes I feel I can see the end.
Sometimes I fall and tumble in my choice of right from wrong.
And I wonder with you will my heart mend.
Sometimes this food does not fill me.
Sometimes this liquor does not numb.
Sometimes I am so lost and lonely.
And I wonder without you will I succumb.
Sometimes I know what I am doing.
Sometimes I barely have a clue.
Sometimes I fall to my knees weeping.
And I wonder will my search ever find you."
1022,Emotion,SometimesPoemsSometimesIWonderPoembyAnitaAtina,"Sometimes when the days and nights that separate us
Stretch out, an endless void
When the distance becomes torturous
The ache, unbearably real
And the embrace of cold air
Cuts deeper than a knife
I begin to wonder how will I get through
This day, this week, this month without you
Why do our souls entwine wondrously,
When we can’t meet
Why do our bodies yearn so longingly,
When the simplest touch is denied
Yes ours is a bonding of souls
In this life, our bodies far removed
But in every life, we will seek each other
Ceaselessly journeying together
On this path, with petals strewn over stones
Finding love, as the light grows."
1023,Emotion,SometimesPoemsSometimesThatIsDrasticPoembyLawrenceSPertillar,"Raised to believe...
If they wished reality not to exist,
They could ignore it away!
Or kneel on knees to pray to false symbols
And/or deities with their likenesses
And ask 'them' to remove reality
Out of their way.
Since they can not fathom,
Those they have chosen
To defame by slander,
To 'be' and 'speak' of truth!
They actually hold them responsible...
For their quality of life,
Crumbling slowly in decay!
And nothing about their existence,
Is based on having a consciousness.
With morals, respect or concern conveyed!
And complaints of the artificialness of it...
They beg of their 'god' to keep it that way!
But the GOD who has created them...
Has always been about change!
And sometimes that is drastic.
At most times that change comes...
And no longer can be delayed."
1024,Emotion,SometimesPoemsSometimesWhenWeTouchSomeonePoembyDavidHarris,"In our lives we move around,
meeting strangers as we go,
sometimes those strangers
touch our lives in ways we do not know.
It is only afterwards,
we realise the effect they’ve had on us.
How they changed our direction,
made us better than before.
They helped us through a crisis
that played upon our mind,
showed us a better road to go,
in our confusion we could not find.
They touched our lives with kind words,
that somehow made us whole.
They became a beloved friend;
we are forever in their dept.
More times or not,
they never realised what they’ve done,
until we thank them
and then they are surprised by the fact.
They don’t want us to be beholden to them,
but for their kindness
we will always be thankful so,
for that helping touch,
when we needed that someone we did not know.
The next time someone touches us
in our time of need,
we should reward them,
with just a thank you,
because that is all they need."

Sometimes you cry,
Sometimes you don't even know why.

Sometimes you're with me,
Sometimes you're not,
But still, always, I love you a lot."
1026,Emotion,SometimesPoemsSometimesPoembySlimJim,"Sometimes I feel my life’s just a big nightmare
Sometimes I wish I could stand up to my greatest fear
Sometimes I wish it all were new
Sometimes I wish it were happening to you
Sometimes I wish people could only see
Another side of me
Sometimes I wish I were never born
So I wouldn’t be here for you to scorn
Sometimes I wonder why I’m only a friend
Sometimes I wonder will anyone care if my life came to an end
Sometimes I wish you were in my shoes,
So you could see life from my point of view
Sometimes I wonder if I'm just too late
Sometimes I wonder if there’s such a thing as “Fate”
Sometimes I wonder why there’s night and day
Sometimes I wonder why my life’s this way
Sometimes I wish I could jump the track
Sometimes I wish I could just go back
Sometimes I wish I had a risk worth the take
Sometimes I wish I could erase every mistake
Sometimes I pretend everything is fine
Sometimes I wish I was on the frontline
Sometimes I wish life would turn out right
Sometimes I wish I could win the fight
But nothing is right and nothing is fine
So I stand-alone and wait for the end of time,
If you wish to join me go ahead
Cause in the end we’ll all be dead."
1027,Emotion,SometimesPoemsSometimesIWantToCryPoembyAmberZitzloff,"Sometimes, I want to cry.
Sometimes, I want to die.
Most times, I just ask why.
Why does it always happen this way?
Why is she always greater than me?
Why doesn't it get better?
Sometimes, I wish I would die.
Sometimes, I just want to cry.
I always ask myself why.
Why does she get to be free?
Why is she so much better than me?
Most of all, why does she always lie to me?"

Fly so high up in the sky.
Sometimes I wonder why,

But that just isn't it,
We all throw fits.
But none of us resist.
Sometimes girls like us fight over boys,
Just because we want them as toys.
But why? They're just boys
Sometimes I just get so sad,
That all I am is bad.
Does this just mean I have had,
Soemthing very extremely bad,
Sometimes I...

1029,Emotion,SometimesPoemssometimesInSupplicationPoembyAdelineFoster,"Sometimes In Supplication
Sometimes in supplication,
Or just in earnest prayer,
I kneel beside my bed, and then
I feel Him lift my care.
But other times I’m lying,
Cradled snugly in my bed,
When joyfilled words of thanks I raise
By thoughts within my head.
What comfort, this, to realize
No matter what the case,
He sees and He does not despise
The position or the face.
Sometimes my weary eyelids
Force me into sleep
Before my prayer is ended,
Without my thanks complete.
Then, when I wake refreshed once more,
I thank Him once again
That what was hours of sleep to me
Was just a pause to Him."
1030,Emotion,SometimesPoemsSometimesIFeelYouPoembyDianaPoems,"Sometimes I feel you
Your presence
Tickling my neck
Sometimes I feel you
Waking up
Feeling my Sweat drip
I saw you
Sometimes I reach for you
My hand stretching
My muscles stiffening
I cannot get to you
Sometimes I talk to you
My eyes closed
In the middle of the night
When my body sleeps
And my mind does not
Sometimes I feel you
Dripping from the sky
You are lonely
You seem sad
You bring weather
That makes my bones weak
Sometimes I feel you
Through my window
Gently stroking the blinds
Sometimes I hear you
Whistling through the air
Creating a tornado of despair
Sometimes I grieve for you
Your life was too short
When you left this world
I wasn't even born
But, you are not a stranger
You are my angel
And when you cry
You bring rain
And when you smile
The clouds move
Like your lips do
And the sunshine peaks through
Sometimes I feel you
Through black and white pictures
Your eyes gazing at me
Seeing the creation your daughter has made
You try hard to smile
Behind a garden
You have tamed
Only soon
Your garden will no longer be in your hands
Your eyes dry up
Your flowers dry up
Your hands no longer tame gardens on Earth
Sometimes I feel you
Through my mothers garden
Sometimes I taste you
Through my mothers recipes
Sometimes I see you
Through my mothers eyes"
1031,Emotion,SometimesPoemsSometimesPoembyCharlesWiles,"Sometimes it rains in deserts,
Sometimes it snows in June,
Sometimes a burning sun
Is cooled behind the moon.
Sometimes a classic's written,
Sometimes a poem's sung,
Sometimes the wisest words
Are spoken by the young.
Sometimes the treasure's golden,
Sometimes the victory's won,
Sometimes the road not taken
Is where the path begun.
Sometimes when all is rotten,
Sometimes when hope is gone,
Sometimes your foe is worthy
And helps you carry on.
Sometimes a miracle happens,
Sometimes the fear's misplaced,
Sometimes the hope that's lost
Is once again embraced.
Sometimes our tears are happy,
Sometimes the hate undone,
Sometimes the chains are broken
And the world stands up as one."

if they misinterpret that
is not really intended for hiding
not the selfishness of your very own fingers
but
if they only know it by heart
are offerings asking
if you too are ready and willing to give them
the way you cover things are manners of asking
are you also willing to give
and give wholeheartedly without asking for
anything in return?
sometimes let me tell you
when i cover some lovely parts of myself
which you misinterpret again as
utter selfishness
nay, it is not the way you see things
skin deep
stones protruding on the low
ebbing of the season
sometimes let me tell you
when i cover the most vulnerable portion of my being
it is, in truth, just a manner of my asking
if indeed, in itself, and by itself,
if your love is true."

that my heart didn't control me the way it does
that everytime i saw your face I didn't smile
That your very laugh didn't warm my heart
that i could just leave, walk away
that you meant nothing to me
but you do, you mean so much
everyday it grows even stronger than before
it's forceful more than I ever thought i could endure
it's confusing and I don't know why
Happiness and pain reside
tears and laughs fill
too much to keep still
Somtimes I wish I were braver
that my fear didn't hold me back from what i wanted to do
that i could say what i really want
is you"

Listening and talking
About things I neither care for
Or make any attempt
to pay attention to.
Referencing his business methodology,
he congratulates himself at
the skills he has so cleverly defined.
I yawn
And attempt to stay awake.
8 months down I think,
4 to go.
Hang in there, David.
There they sit
Conference call
After conference call
Making plans about nothing
Ado
To do
To done
To did
To never did at all.
And I wag my finger
Because here I sit,
Attempting to stay awake
so to grasp
the chain
that I once called a dream.
Here we sit,
Revolving doors
And pushup chairs
Swiveling
Swilling
Swatting
Sw earing
And missing out,
Oh how we miss out.
Because all we know
Is that while we sit,
And we talk,
Feigning importance
And shuffling ideas
Of roads
upon rows;
we find castles,
That lead to nowhere.
And
There I sit,
one kind,
of a kind,
of empty little road,
Driven by
headless horsemen carriages.
No dreams
Just a 401k,
a stall,
And detail men.
But still I sit
Somewhere,
Behind a gate,
Over a fence
to a chain,
which gracelessly
leads to
a cemetery.
Here I sit.
Oh,
how I sit.

1041,Emotion,SometimesPoemsSometimesTheSkysTooBrightPoembyDylanThomas,"Sometimes the sky's too bright,
Or has too many clouds or birds,
And far away's too sharp a sun
To nourish thinking of him.
Why is my hand too blunt
To cut in front of me
My horrid images for me,
Of over-fruitful smiles,
The weightless touching of the lip
I wish to know
I cannot lift, but can,
The creature with the angel's face
Who tells me hurt,
And sees my body go
Down into misery?
No stopping. Put the smile
Where tears have come to dry.
The angel's hurt is left;
His telling burns.
Sometimes a woman's heart has salt,
Or too much blood;
I tear her breast,
And see the blood is mine,
Flowing from her, but mine,
And then I think
Perhaps the sky's too bright;
And watch my hand,
But do not follow it,
And feel the pain it gives,
But do not ache."
1042,Emotion,SometimesPoemsSometimesIWonderPoembyMathildeBlind,"Sometimes I wonder if you guess
The deep impassioned tenderness
Which overflows my heart;
The love I never dare confess;
Yet hard, yea, harder to repress
Than tears too fain to start.
Sometimes I ponder, O my sweet,
The things I'll tell you when we meet;
But straightway at your sight
My heart's blood oozes to my feet
Like thawing waters in the heat,
Confused with too much light.
I hardly know, when you are near,
If it is love, or joy, or fear
Which fills my languid frame;
Enveloped in your atmosphere,
My dark self seems to disappear,
A moth entombed in flame."
1043,Emotion,SometimesPoemsSometimesItHappensPoembyBrianPatten,"And sometimes it happens that you are friends and then
You are not friends,
And friendship has passed.
And whole days are lost and among them
A fountain empties itself.
And sometimes it happens that you are loved and then
You are not loved,
And love is past.
And whole days are lost and among them
A fountain empties itself into the grass.
And sometimes you want to speak to her and then
You do not want to speak,
Then the opportunity has passed.
Your dreams flare up, they suddenly vanish.
And also it happens that there is nowhere to go and then
There is somewhere to go,
Then you have bypassed.
And the years flare up and are gone,
Quicker than a minute.
So you have nothing.
You wonder if these things matter and then
As soon you begin to wonder if these things matter
They cease to matter,
And caring is past.
And a fountain empties itself into the grass."

1046,Emotion,SometimesPoemsSometimesPastPresentFuturePoembyAnubhavSharma,"Sometimes…..I travel back to my past,
Down the memory lanes.
I find myself alone, lost in vain,
I see myself struggling, to live in this world,
With pain in my heart, that I could never tell in words.
I looked for a shoulder, which could give me support,
But no one heard me and passed on to their roads,
Than you walked in, with a wonderful smile,
This gave me strength and love for life,
The touch of your hand and your talking eyes,
Made me sure, it is you for whom my heart cries.
Sometimes…I look in to my present,
With my eyes wide open,
‘cause I never thought it would happen,
My worries have gone & I have lost my pain,
All I’ve got is luv and your smile like a Summer Rain,
The power of love and the strength of your words,
Has made me eager to live in this world,
Smile on your lips and happiness in your eyes,
This is all where my world lies.
Sometimes….I look in to the future
With dreams in my eyes,
Kissing your lips at every sunrise
I see you with me wrapped in my arms,
Giving you love and all the charms,
‘cause you are the one who has changed my life,
So I always dream you as my loving wife,
Now I always wish to forget my past,
& luv you forever until my breath last,
I pray to God may my dreams come true,
& I could always tell that “I Love You”."

To not see this coming
To not believe the people around me
He showed me the world
But I paid the price for falling in love
He was the school hottie and I was just the new girl
He smiled a danger smile
I just smiled a sly smile
When he first talked to me it was love at first sight
Until the day he snapped
He grabbed me by my waist chain when he saw me with Jonathan
When I got home there was a welt on my waist
He apologized over and over the next day and I forgave him
But it never changed how he treated me
People would see the bruises on me but I always had an excuse to protect him
Until the day he came up with a new way to “punish” me
He would bite me
Leaving marks on my arms and neck
That’s when my friend decided enough was enough
It was hard seeing him being dragged away
To see the only one you ever loved being dragged away from your life
I still love him no matter what he did
The scares are starting to go away
But the way he treated me and the way he so wrongly yelled
YOU WILL PAY FOR RATTING YOU STUPID B****
Will never leave my head
Even after all of this I still LOVE HIM"

what the true meaning of lifes all about;
Try and figure out my insucurites,
and the reason Im so full of doubt,
Maybe Im too hard on myself,
with the pressure I apply from within;
Maybe I want too much to fast,
here comes doubt creeping in again.
How can I find a balance in life,
where I float with an even keal?
Not worring about the future,
or losing for life its zeal?"

The way we can talk about anything,
The way you smile, like you haven’t a care in the world,
The way I can’t seem to let you go,

Sometimes I think, just maybe I like you
The way everyone thinks you’re dumb when you’re not
The way you surprise me when you say things
The way you’re so awkwardly cute
Sometimes I think I like that
Sometimes I think, just maybe I’m meant to be alone
Meant to always search for love but never find it
Meant to be content all by myself
Meant to cry at every romance movie

There's no one around to cry if I cry
Nobody cares for hearing my crazy life's song
Nobody cares whether I am right or wrong
There’s only me
I sing to me in the night sitting here alone
Closest to me are the moon and the stars
Dancing with me are the leaves, the grasses
I see another shooting star to wish up on
Just a silent prayer, for a better day
This strange place won't have me
Where is the Love? !"

Flying in the vast sky
Sans any pains or sorrows

Quenching my thirst
With the chilled droplets
Forgetting all my rage and anger"
1054,Emotion,SometimesPoemsMyParentsSometimesFightForTimPoembyPhilippaLane,"I wish my parents wouldn’t fight –
I feel like a cat curled up in a corner
With no one noticing it.
They act like robots out of control,
Moving clumsily, crashing gears,
Not like parents at all.
They sound like horrid black crows –
It would be ridiculous
If it wasn’t so serious.
When it’s a really bad fight
I feel bloodless and cold
Like a victim of Dracula.
When my parents fight
I'm really scared,
Because I think
They will divorce
Or separate
And leave me.
When I argue with my sister
it’s usually because
she cheats at cards,
But when my parents quarrel
It’s like unravelling
A ball of messed-up string-
Hard to find the start.
I think of words to help,
But they get tangled in my throat
And don’t come out.
I’d like to be a bear for a while,
And crawl into a hole
or hibernate for good,
Or run away
But usually I end up
Going to bed in my clothes
And lying awake instead.
They might not separate,
But I can’t be sure, can I?
Earthquakes happen now and then,

unscheduled touch, that smell, dust

I don't know
what we would find years later - perhaps
this absurd nonsensicality which a fate
gave us, but irreparable already now
mistake, which at one time was with choice
thought over, and maybe exactly something,
what we aren't able to live today without (?)
whether the time causes that we are still

completely beside (?)"
1056,Emotion,SometimesPoemsIKnowSometimesPoembyTyroneWingfield,"I know sometimes you wonder,
Just how true are my intentions.
I know how you must ponder,
Just what are my motivations.
But these are things I thought you knew,
And thought you would never question.
The fact that I love you,
Should be known without mention.
You I have loved before I even knew what it was,
And I have drempt of you all my life.
Without a reason, or a cause,
And in every dream you was my wife.
For you I would do anything
As I have and always will
Just for the joy you bring
And I think thats a hell of a deal
Nolonger should you wonder,
Just how true are my intentions.
Nolonger should you must ponder,
Just what are my motivations."

'a face so perfect, God dreams
of it in His sleep.

the green brush of the Earth.
how she smiles, with the corners
of her mouth spread
like the corners of the sky,
allowing an attentive observer to see
all the majesty and mystery
of
the heavens in her mirth.'

and moving that 'they
border on
open heart surgery.'

And when he goes home from the local he argues with Betty his wife
She no longer cooks him his supper she tells him you can help yourself
In the fridge you'll find eggs and bacon and there's coffee
and tea on the shelf.
Their marriage as such it is over they live in the same house that is all
though Betty will talk of the good days when happier times she recall,
When their children were growing up in the sixties and Joe had drink under control
Until the love between them faded and boredom of their marriage took toll.
When asked how come she still lives with him? she says where I live I will stay
I'm sixty five years on a pension and my hair is silvery gray
And though we live under the same roof and we argue almost every day
There's nothing of love left between us we have gone our separate way.
Sometimes love does not last a lifetime despite what the romantics might say
And the story of Joseph and Betty is a story of love in decay,
He once showed her lots of affection but that was a long time ago
And though they live under the same roof no love left between her and Joe."

Turn the other cheek and
Find joy in the lilies of
Life's wide field-
But in the passage of Time
The pace of growing Seasons,
reality sows hardness
Like looming mountains-
Granite weight builds upon
My sinking shoulders,
And what is a gift is set aside
As burden-
Suddenly, halting by faith's pull,
Reaching for the altar within,
And placing my small offering
Upon prayer's perfect shield-
The bandages fall and reveal
New Light from the east,
Bursting in priceless gold.
And slanting my Self to Him-
The Bread melts into my
Soul, as pure substance-
Filling the need to be,
more, more than just Human-
jThe water beckons clear, 'drink'
And taking the tiny paper cup
To my thirsting lips He enters,
Giving me the Forgiveness meal."

Cares aught about the little deeds of men;
And if their day and time can reach his ken
Or raise their breath above the hungry sod.
Does He who lightly holds th' eternal rod,
Now taut, now loose, the threads of Why and When?
Giving passing heed--or be they one or ten--
To one-time flesh but now the wind-blown clod?
If men can die who never yet knew life,
And, smiling, hold it is no strange affair;
Or live when death were welcome boon of strife,
Torn, broken sheaves the ghostly reapers spare;
The saints must grieve for earthly sorrows rife,
And God must heed, yea surely, God must care."

That gets lost on its long turning on way
Or a flying high clouded lonesome sparrow

The seedlings of the passionate going songs
That grows on the heart to each sparkling give
And each new aspiring passion belongs
In its fulsome ways there to onward live
The colors of the truest summer blossom
The reddish with the pink shades between
The beauty of moments that kindle love's thought
Delicate and decent where roots are from
Each true compartment that can not be seen
In asking questions what love is and ought"

that it is time to give way
for other souls to
cry to weep to sigh
that it is time for some
other creatures who died
when they were once
children
to play their forgotten games

When I have sweet dream or a horrifying nightmare
When an angel meets me or my body breaks with desire
When I am drunk with wine or some haunting memory
When love could have been around me to see me waiting
So long my feet grow roots like trees waiting for birds
In vegetation now I harness longer the east longer the west
Down your path my eyes tired seeing your steps and one day
I shall follow as I saw you the moment when you rose up as if
Touching feet looking deep in my eyes to see signs of autumn
Lest I may not love some one else so intensely again
That sometimes I want to forget you even if it means
Forgetting myself that has lived the torments of your love

Holding to moments of its dullness sky
Seeds that are trying to earth again shall die
Until again spring comes in its prime
Wish you sometimes want can't come through
For the new beginning is not in yet
To rise from yield of the summer blue height

Sometimes in life, I wonder just what I'm doing?
The energy's there, but the trouble is brewing.
I seem to have, no control of myself,
I just turned away, now I'm with someone else.
The days just fly by, yet there's so much to do.
I look to a face, to just pull me through.
Time just can't wait, so it just marches on.
All of the things, just, seem to be wrong?
Just turned my back and everything's gone...........
Sometimes in life, I don't believe what I see.
Are all of these things, just part of me?
I pick up the pieces, but some seem to be missing,
I look for the answers, but it feels like I'm guessing?
Sometimes in life, you can't get what you need.
You feel so empty, yet there's nothing to feed.
Your soul feels so empty, nothing can fill the hole.
It's hard to find direction, when you just don't know.
Sometimes in life, I think I know my way?
It's just around the corner, I might make it today?
Though things seem hopeless, there's always faith,
Carries me back, to a place that is safe.
Sometimes in life, there seems something better.
But the rain just comes and you just get wetter.
Things always appear better, on the other side.
At least until you get there, then you must hide.
Sometimes in life, I just wanted the truth.
But it was surrounded by lies and they just got loose.
The answers don't match, the questions I find.
Uncertainty robs, my peace of mind.............."

Sometimes,

Sometimes,
That we’re not to be,
Sometimes,
When I think about our memories……
Where you,
Lock your arms around me,
Letting our minds go free,
When you,
Sit by my side under the tree,
Hand in hand we can see,
The moonlight shining ever bright as can be,
How you, sing the song of our lullaby…
Sometimes,
I hum along this vivid tone,
Sometimes,
When I’m all alone,
Sometimes,
I still dream about you,
Sometimes,
All I can think of is you…
Since your trembling voice,
Muted……
When the sorrow siren,
Ended……
You left me in the rain,
Jaded……
When I last saw your face,

But to see who cares enough to start
Sometimes I keep myself inside a fence
Not as a defense
But rather to see who really feels me... who has enough sense
Sometimes I keep on creating obstacles for whoever wants me close
Not to play “hard to get”
But rather to know why am I the one he chose?
Sometimes I prefer to be isolated
Not to be lonely …
But rather to see who cares enough to come close and approach me
Sometimes I prefer to be remote
Not because of fear
But rather to see who cares enough to be near
Sometimes I prefer to keep the distance
Not to act arrogant
But rather to see who cares enough to be persistent
Sometimes I do not take any initiative
Not because I’m acting so protective
But to know to whom am I really attractive

Not to show no interest
But to see who cares enough to be impressive
Sometimes I intend to be mysterious
Not because I want to look serious
But rather to see who cares enough to be curious
Sometimes I intend to be unsocial
Not to be rude
But rather to see to whom am I really special
Sometimes I keep on wearing masks hiding my real self
Not to pretend
But rather to see who will remove them in the end
Sometimes I keep all my secrets covered
To see to whom and how it will be discovered
Sometimes I lock my door
To see who is willing to explore
Who really cares enough to know me more

I haven’t found that someone who cares enough to succeed

Of its presence I was unaware,
But because of all the changes,
I got a lot of stares.
'What's wrong with you? '
I heard several ask,
But an answer I could not provide.
Before I knew it, I had created a mask, to hide behind.
Someone else on the outside,
Why can't I be me?
I just don't want to hurt you,
Is that so hard to see?
I put up a wall,
Between me and you,
Hoping to break my fall,
But doing so only confused us all.
It was in my heart, yet also deeper within,
Why am I so empty inside?
I just want to run away and hide.
It's scaring me,
As is its job,
Attacking me,
Like an angry mob.
What is all this anger?
Where is it from?
Why am I so lonely?
Why do I feel so dumb?
I don't know what to do or say,
I keep to myself,
Other people-stay away.
I'm afraid of showing you,
How I really feel,
Who I really am,
Hurting you- of this I am afraid.
If I am myself,
Will you like me anyway?
If I speak my mind,
Will you make me go away?
I couldn't escape and locked myself inside,
But then one day I did decide
To get down on my knees and pray,
'Lord, what is this? Please, take it away! '
That helped some, but I needed more,
Open up, unlock the door.
I begged and pled
For it to leave,
But to my voice it would not heed.
For I was 'dead, '
sown was the seed,
Inside my head,
Done was the deed.
It's tearing at me from within,
And working its way out,
It's ready to succeed,
Of this there is no doubt.
I finally asked for help,
Even though I was afraid,
I poured out my heart,
And was recieved with grace.
True concern, encouraging words,
And then it was finally over,
Its presence I could deny.
And I thank God for my family,
And my friends so dear,
I thank Him for the body,
For holding me so near.
Now when I look back,
I'm glad those days are through,
I thank God for my peace,
And His love so true."

like the right of a state to kill,
that to me is wrong,
like the right to have slaves
that was wrong, but they once
thought it was right,
something that feels so right
may, sometimes, be also be wrong,
like feeling love, and too much love
for a neighbor or yourself,
it can be intoxicating at times,
and it can kill you,
because what is right exists only
in our human minds,
limited, too narrow, too
confined in our flesh and blood,
in the context of our culture,
in the frames of our time,
to the dictates of religion
the liberality of our education,
to our biases and prejudices,
what we believe in, what we
touch with faith in dark places
what we try to light with candles,
or see in microscopes or see in
telescopes, or see with our eyes
and hearts wide open,
may still be wrong, or
still be not right,
so what is right after all?
Possibly, this can be right,
But possibly this can also be wrong,
We can always pray. But the doubt
Is always there. Cogito ergo sum.

Of a pen against paper
Sometimes I don't write for days

Where the angels fear to tread.
Sometimes I listen real well
To words that my soul speaks,
And sometimes I dont hear reason

Sometimes when it rains
I see the sound that it makes,
And sometimes it floods my heart
Because of my mistakes.
And sometimes when it snows
I hear it's gentle sound,
As it falls like silent thunder
Everywhere upon the ground.
And sometimes when I see you
I think I'm really seeing me,
Because sometimes life's not really
All it would seem to be.
Sometimes instead it's all gone
Sort of topsy turvey,
And sometimes right or wrong
Is not as clear as day.
Sometimes it all gets muddled
From black and white to gray,
And sometimes that path to righteousness
Just doesn't lead the way.
Then sometimes before I know it
I find me standing in the light,
Because sometimes when I get lost
You're there to set me right.
And sometimes when I think
That all in my life is gone
I look and see you standing
Waiting there within the dawn.
And sometimes when I'm feeling
That I'm running out of time,
You're love helps me see
That I can run to you sometimes........
And sometimes you will save me
And keep me safe from harm,
But sometimes you'll just guide me
And lead me by the arm.
To show me that just sometimes
I need to make my way,
And that sometimes all you can do
Is watch me falter as you pray.
For sometimes lessons learned
Come about in the hardest ways,
So that sometimes in myself
I can learn to be amazed.
But sometimes you will hold me
And at others set me free,
So that sometimes I can find my way
Back to loving me"

That there really is an unlocked door
Just waiting for you to open it

When you’re down
And the world seems dark and empty
Your forever friend lifts you up in spirit
And makes that dark and empty world
Suddenly seem bright and full
Your forever friend gets you through
The hard times, the sad times
And the confused times
Your forever friend holds you hand
And tells you that
Everything is going to be ok.

You feel happy and complete
Because you need not to worry
You have a forever friend for life
And forever has no end"

To a low hours flight
Dream must stay and never leave
Only be ours to give
Throw away here now its heave

In to the dark and forgotten
Moments of well being climbs
From those steps often trottin'
Let it not happen again
Felling that lonesome gray
Then has my hope been in vain

telling you the best is on its way..
Sometimes the waters of yesterday seem black
showing nothing but the pain you've felt
the tears you've cried; the sorrow you're forced to hide..
Sometimes the world of Today seems revealing
granting you a moment of peace before you take your next step
allowing you for just this one heartbeat to let go."
1094,Emotion,SometimesPoemsSometimesIWonderPoembyStarrWilliams,"Sometimes I wonder,
Will I come through?
Can I make it to the other side?
And also, will you?
As I walk through the rain,
I can count on a few,
And when sometimes they leave me,
I wonder, should I pursue?
God didn’t promise,
As I walk through this life,
Skies without clouds,
Or storm without quiet.
Maybe someday, I’ll understand,
When I’m coming up to
The end of this land.
The day is approaching,
I know the time is near,
When the end of all things
Will end all things here.
Asking myself this,
What still will be left?
Can all this nothingness,
And this worldly mindset,
Be pleasing to the one,
Who made the sun rise and set?
Why do they taunt?
And say, “You are wrong”?
When my king is coming and theirs
Lies underground.
Mine conquered death,
Theirs only died,
Mine lives again
Theirs, death has tied.
My silent prayer,
Comes from the heart,
Lord save these people,
And can I be a part?
Be a part of your plan,
To change many hearts,
For the kingdom that lasts,
Has neither end nor start.
And as you also
Walk through the storm,
Remember what it’s about,
Who you are living for.
Not for this world,
Nor mans empty gain,
You are living for him,
Who restored your soul again."

and sometimes she thinks she dose nothing but fear,
sometimes she wants to be alone,

and sometimes she thinks it will stay bad forever,
sometimes she thinks this all she can do,
is write poems to help her through."
1096,Emotion,NightPoemsLoversGiftsXiiiLastNightInTheGardenPoembyRabindranathTagore,"Last night in the garden I offered you my youth's foaming wine. You
lifted the cup to your lips, you shut your eyes and smiled while
I raised your veil, unbound your tresses, drawing down upon my
breast your face sweet with its silence, last night when the moon's
dream overflowed the world of slumber.
To-day in the dew-cooled calm of the dawn you are walking to
God's temple, bathed and robed in white, with a basketful of
flowers in your hand. I stand aside in the shade under the tree,
with my head bent, in the calm of the dawn by the lonely road to
the temple."
1097,Emotion,NightPoemsAsOneWhoHavingWanderedAllNightLongPoembyRobertLouisStevenson,"AS one who having wandered all night long
In a perplexed forest, comes at length
In the first hours, about the matin song,
And when the sun uprises in his strength,
To the fringed margin of the wood, and sees,
Gazing afar before him, many a mile
Of falling country, many fields and trees,
And cities and bright streams and far-off Ocean's smile:
I, O Melampus, halting, stand at gaze:
I, liberated, look abroad on life,
Love, and distress, and dusty travelling ways,
The steersman's helm, the surgeon's helpful knife,
On the lone ploughman's earth-upturning share,
The revelry of cities and the sound
Of seas, and mountain-tops aloof in air,
And of the circling earth the unsupported round:
I, looking, wonder: I, intent, adore;
And, O Melampus, reaching forth my hands
In adoration, cry aloud and soar
In spirit, high above the supine lands
And the low caves of mortal things, and flee
To the last fields of the universe untrod,
Where is no man, nor any earth, nor sea,
And the contented soul is all alone with God."

1100,Emotion,NightPoemsThinkingOfAFriendAtNightPoembyHermannHesse,"In this evil year, autumn comes early...
I walk by night in the field, alone, the rain clatters,
The wind on my hat...And you? And you, my friend?
You are standing- maybe- and seeing the sickle moon
Move in a small arc over the forests
And bivouac fire, red in the black valley.
You are lying- maybe- in a straw field and sleeping
And dew falls cold on your forehead and battle jacket.
It's possible tonight you're on horseback,
The farthest outpost, peering along, with a gun in your fist,
Smiling, whispering, to your exhausted horse.
Maybe- I keep imagining- you are spending the night
As a guest in a strange castle with a park
And writing a letter by candlelight, and tapping
On the piano keys by the window,
Groping for a sound...
- And maybe
You are already silent, already dead, and the day
Will shine no longer into your beloved
Serious eyes, and your beloved brown hand hangs wilted,
And your white forehead split open- Oh, if only,
If only, just once, that last day, I had shown you, told you
Something of my love, that was too timid to speak!
But you know me, you know...and, smiling, you nod
Tonight in front of your strange castle,
And you nod to your horse in the drenched forest,
And you nod to your sleep to your harsh clutter of straw,
And think about me, and smile.
And maybe,
Maybe some day you will come back from the war,
and take a walk with me some evening,
And somebody will talk about Longwy, Luttich, Dammerkirch,
And smile gravely, and everything will be as before,
And no one will speak a word of his worry,
Of his worry and tenderness by night in the field,
Of his love. And with a single joke
You will frighten away the worry, the war, the uneasy nights,
The summer lightning of shy human friendship,
Into the cool past that will never come back.

1101,Emotion,NightPoemsRainyNightPoembyDorothyParker,"Ghosts of all my lovely sins,
Who attend too well my pillow,
Gay the wanton rain begins;
Hide the limp and tearful willow.
Turn aside your eyes and ears,
Trail away your robes of sorrow,
You shall have my further years-
You shall walk with me tomorrow.
I am sister to the rain;
Fey and sudden and unholy,
Petulant at the windowpane,
Quickly lost, remembered slowly.
I have lived with shades, a shade;
I am hung with graveyard flowers.
Let me be tonight arrayed
In the silver of the showers.
Every fragile thing shall rust;
When another April passes
I may be a furry dust,
Sifting through the brittle grasses.
All sweet sins shall be forgot;
Who will live to tell their siring?
Hear me now, nor let me rot
Wistful still, and still aspiring.
Ghosts of dear temptations, heed;
I am frail, be you forgiving.
See you not that I have need
To be living with the living?
Sail, tonight, the Styx's breast;
Glide among the dim processions
Of the exquisite unblest,
Spirits of my shared transgressions,
Roam with young Persephone.
Plucking poppies for your slumber . . .
With the morrow, there shall be
One more wraith among your number."

I move my hand over
slopes, falls, lumps of sight,
Lashes barely able to be touched,
Lips that give way so easily
it's a shock to feel underneath them
The bones smile.
Muffled a little, barely cloaked,
Zygoma, maxillary, turbinate.
2
I put my hand
On the side of your face,
You lean your head a little
Into my hand--and so,
I know you're a dormouse
Taken up in winter sleep,
A lonely, stunned weight.
3
A cheekbone,
A curved piece of brow,
A pale eyelid
Float in the dark,
And now I make out
An eye, dark,
Wormed with far-off, unaccountable lights.
4
Hardly touching, I hold
What I can only think of
As some deepest of memories in my arms,
Not mine, but as if the life in me
Were slowly remembering what it is.
You lie here now in your physicalness,
This beautiful degree of reality.
5
And now the day, raft that breaks up, comes on.
I think of a few bones
Floating on a river at night,
The starlight blowing in a place on the water,
The river leaning like a wave towards the emptiness."
1103,Emotion,NightPoemsANightRainInSummerPoembyJamesHenryLeighHunt,"Open the window, and let the air
Freshly blow upon face and hair,
And fill the room, as it fills the night,
With the breath of the rain's sweet might.
Hark! the burthen, swift and prone!
And how the odorous limes are blown!
Stormy Love's abroad, and keeps
Hopeful coil for gentle sleeps.
Not a blink shall burn to-night
In my chamber, of sordid light;
Nought will I have, not a window-pane,
'Twixt me and the air and the great good rain,
Which ever shall sing me sharp lullabies;
And God's own darkness shall close mine eyes;
And I will sleep, with all things blest,
In the pure earth-shadow of natural rest."
1104,Emotion,NightPoemsLastNightIDreamedOfChickensPoembyJackPrelutsky,"Last night I dreamed of chickens,
there were chickens everywhere,
they were standing on my stomach,
they were nesting in my hair,
they were pecking at my pillow,
they were hopping on my head,
they were ruffling up their feathers
as they raced about my bed.
They were on the chairs and tables,
they were on the chandeliers,
they were roosting in the corners,
they were clucking in my ears,
there were chickens, chickens, chickens
for as far as I could see...
when I woke today, I noticed
there were eggs on top of me."

The grey sea and the long black land;

And the startled little waves that leap
In fiery ringlets from their sleep,
As I gain the cove with pushing prow,
And quench its speed i' the slushy sand.
II.
Then a mile of warm sea-scented beach;
Three fields to cross till a farm appears;
A tap at the pane, the quick sharp scratch
And blue spurt of a lighted match,
And a voice less loud, thro' its joys and fears,
Than the two hearts beating each to each!"

I was sweating on the bed
and I could hear the crickets
and there was a cat fight outside
and I could feel my soul dropping down through the
mattress
and just before it hit the floor I jumped up
I was almost too weak to walk
but I walked around and turned on all the lights
and then I went back to bed
and dropped it down again and
I was up
turning on all the lights
I had a 7-year-old daughter
and I felt sure she wouldn't want me dead
otherwise it wouldn't have
mattered
but all that night
nobody phoned
nobody came by with a beer
my girlfriend didn't phone
all I could hear were the crickets and it was
hot
and I kept working at it
getting up and down
until the first of the sun came through the window
through the bushes
and then I got on the bed
and the soul stayed
inside at last and
I slept.

beating on the doors and windows

I get great letters in the mail
hate letters and love letters.

Then droop my head,
And sink to dreams of thee --
My Fatherland, of thee!"

Sails with her happy destiny;
Oft is she hid from mortal eye
Or dimly seen,
But when the clouds asunder fly
How bright her mien!
Far different we--a froward race,
Thousands though rich in Fortune's grace
With cherished sullenness of pace
Their way pursue,
Ingrates who wear a smileless face
The whole year through.
If kindred humours e'er would make
My spirit droop for drooping's sake,
From Fancy following in thy wake,
Bright ship of heaven!
A counter impulse let me take
And be forgiven."

Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.

1112,Emotion,NightPoemsAllNightAllNightPoembyDelmoreSchwartz,"""I have been one acquainted with the night"" - Robert Frost
Rode in the train all night, in the sick light. A bird
Flew parallel with a singular will. In daydream's moods and
attitudes
The other passengers slumped, dozed, slept, read,
Waiting, and waiting for place to be displaced
On the exact track of safety or the rack of accident.
Looked out at the night, unable to distinguish
Lights in the towns of passage from the yellow lights
Numb on the ceiling. And the bird flew parallel and still
As the train shot forth the straight line of its whistle,
Forward on the taut tracks, piercing empty, familiar --
The bored center of this vision and condition looked and
looked
Down through the slick pages of the magazine (seeking
The seen and the unseen) and his gaze fell down the well
Of the great darkness under the slick glitter,
And he was only one among eight million riders and
readers.
And all the while under his empty smile the shaking drum
Of the long determined passage passed through him
By his body mimicked and echoed. And then the train
Like a suddenly storming rain, began to rush and thresh--
The silent or passive night, pressing and impressing
The patients' foreheads with a tightening-like image
Of the rushing engine proceeded by a shaft of light
Piercing the dark, changing and transforming the silence
Into a violence of foam, sound, smoke and succession.
A bored child went to get a cup of water,
And crushed the cup because the water too was
Boring and merely boredom's struggle.
The child, returning, looked over the shoulder
Of a man reading until he annoyed the shoulder.
A fat woman yawned and felt the liquid drops
Drip down the fleece of many dinners.
And the bird flew parallel and parallel flew
The black pencil lines of telephone posts, crucified,
At regular intervals, post after post
Of thrice crossed, blue-belled, anonymous trees.
And then the bird cried as if to all of us:
0 your life, your lonely life
What have you ever done with it,
And done with the great gift of consciousness?
What will you ever do with your life before death's
knife
Provides the answer ultimate and appropriate?
As I for my part felt in my heart as one who falls,
Falls in a parachute, falls endlessly, and feel the vast
Draft of the abyss sucking him down and down,
An endlessly helplessly falling and appalled clown:
This is the way that night passes by, this
Is the overnight endless trip to the famous unfathomable
abyss."
1113,Emotion,NightPoemsLonesomeNightPoembyHermannHesse,"You brothers, who are mine,
Poor people, near and far,
Longing for every star,
Dream of relief from pain,
You, stumbling dumb
At night, as pale stars break,
Lift your thin hands for some
Hope, and suffer, and wake,
Poor muddling commonplace,
You sailors who must live
Unstarred by hopelessness,
We share a single face.
Give me my welcome back.

1114,Emotion,NightPoemsNightPoemPoembyMargaretAtwood,"There is nothing to be afraid of,
it is only the wind
changing to the east, it is only
your father the thunder
your mother the rain
In this country of water
with its beige moon damp as a mushroom,
its drowned stumps and long birds
that swim, where the moss grows
on all sides of the trees
and your shadow is not your shadow
but your reflection,
your true parents disappear
when the curtain covers your door.
We are the others,
the ones from under the lake
who stand silently beside your bed
with our heads of darkness.
We have come to cover you
with red wool,
with our tears and distant whipers.
You rock in the rain's arms
the chilly ark of your sleep,
while we wait, your night
father and mother
with our cold hands and dead flashlight,
knowing we are only
the wavering shadows thrown
by one candle, in this echo
you will hear twenty years later."

Out of the misty eastern cave,
Where, all the long and lone daylight,
Thou wovest dreams of joy and fear,
Which make thee terrible and dear--
Swift be thy flight!
Wrap thy form in a mantle gray,
Star-inwrought!
Blind with thine hair the eyes of day;
Kiss her until she be wearied out,
Then wander o'er city, and sea, and land,
Touching all with thine opiate wand--
Come, long-sought!
When I arose and saw the dawn,
I sighed for thee;
When light rode high, and the dew was gone,
And noon lay heavy on flower and tree,
And the weary day turned to his rest,
Lingering like an unloved guest,
I sighed for thee.
Thy brother Death came, and cried,
Wouldst thou me?
Thy sweet child Sleep, the filmy-eyed,
Murmured like a noontide bee,
Shall I nestle near thy side?
Wouldst thou me?--And I replied,
No, not thee!
Death will come when thou art dead,
Soon, too soon--
Sleep will come when thou art fled;
Of neither would I ask the boon
I ask of thee, beloved Night--
Swift be thine approaching flight,
Come soon, soon!"

I look far out into the pregnant night,
Where I can hear the solemn booming gun
And catch the gleaming of a random light,
That tells me that the ship I seek
is passing, passing.
My tearful eyes my soul's deep hurt are glassing;
For I would hail and check that ship of ships.
I stretch my hands imploring, cry aloud,
My voice falls dead a foot from mine own lips,
And but its ghost doth reach that vessel, passing, passing.
O Earth, O Sky, O Ocean, both surpassing,
O heart of mine, O soul that dreads the dark!
Is there no hope for me? Is there no way
That I may sight and check that speeding bark
Which out of sight and sound is passing, passing?"

Save for the crystal spark
Of a virgin star o'er the purpling lea,
Or the fine, keen, silvery grace of a young
Moon that is hung
O'er the priest-like firs by the sea;
Lo, it is still,
Save for the wind of the hill,
And the luring, primeval sounds that fill
The moist and scented air­
'Tis the truce o' night, away with unrest and care!
Now we may forget
Love's fever and hate's fret,
Forget to-morrow and yesterday;
And the hopes we buried in musky gloom
Will come out of their tomb,
Warm and poignant and gay;
We may wander wide,
With only a wish for a guide,
By heath and pool where the Little Folk bide,
We may share in fairy mirth,
And partake once more in the happy thoughts of earth.
Lo, we may rest
Here on her cradling breast
In the wonderful time of the truce o' night,
And sweet things that happened long ago,
Softly and slow,
Will creep back to us in delight;
And our dreams may be
Compact of young melody,
Just such as under the Eden Tree,
'Mid the seraphim's lullabies,
Eve's might have been ere banished from Paradise."

Where the stars give resistance it does not stop there,

Mark in my heart, O soul, where thou dost dwell,

Whether that countenance can thee affright,
Tears in his eyes quench the amazing light,
Blood fills his frowns, which from his pierced head fell.
And can that tongue adjudge thee unto hell,
Which prayed forgiveness for his foes' fierce spite?
No, no; but as in my idolatry
I said to all my profane mistresses,
Beauty, of pity, foulness only is
A sign of rigour: so I say to thee,
To wicked spirits are horrid shapes assigned,

Shut your eyes.

The window opens: it's not you.

And hose and hydrant cannot here avail;
The flames laugh high and fling their challenging light,
And clouds turn gray and black from silver-pale.
The fire leaps out and licks the ancient walls,
And the big building bends and twists and groans.
A bar drops from its place; a rafter falls
Burning the flowers. The wind in frenzy moans.
The watchers gaze, held wondering by the fire,
The dwellers cry their sorrow to the crowd,
The flames beyond themselves rise higher, higher,
To lose their glory in the frowning cloud,
Yielding at length the last reluctant breath.
And where life lay asleep broods darkly death."

Was she really facing the wall?
Wanted to move out and roll the ball?
Was I judging it as flicker or miscall?
It was definitely welcome and invite,
Sure suggestion for passion to ignite,
Was I indication for call in dark night?
I was amused but it was alright,
I jumped two steps at a time,
Forgot what was the interest prime,
Surely can’t afford to loose the opportunity,
Everything can wait but not the girl with beauty,
She looked as if fairy came on land,
I wondered whether I can move hand in hand,
She was not ready yet to become friend,
Then why did she waved at as signal send,
I was moving in and out,
I did not feel victory but a rout,
Ready to move with laws flout,
Knew nothing what was it all about?
Where to go and whom to ask?
Seemed to me a difficult task,
Rushed to a friend for simple advice,
He too was same as I was novice,
I remembered saying” nothing is unfair”
Most valuable and treasured gift is love affair,
I thought it as simple and fair,
Fragrance spread and filled the air,
She represented dark as night,
Her thoughts were not good and right,
She embraced me with invitation to ride,
I was shocked and emotions couldn’t hide,
She was whore and I took her as right,
Difficult to come out without fight,
I rushed from the scene and left the sight,
Night seemed to me really dark night"
1124,Emotion,NightPoemsQuietNightThoughtsPoembyLiPo,"Before my bed
there is bright moonlight
So that it seems
Like frost on the ground:
Lifting my head
I watch the bright moon,
Lowering my head
I dream that I'm home."
1125,Emotion,NightPoemsNightPoembyWilliamBlake,"The sun descending in the west,
The evening star does shine;
The birds are silent in their nest,
And I must seek for mine.
The moon, like a flower,
In heaven's high bower,
With silent delight
Sits and smiles on the night.
Farewell, green fields and happy groves,
Where flocks have took delight.
Where lambs have nibbled, silent moves
The feet of angels bright;
Unseen they pour blessing,
And joy without ceasing,
On each bud and blossom,
And each sleeping bosom.
They look in every thoughtless nest,
Where birds are covered warm;
They visit caves of every beast,
To keep them all from harm.
If they see any weeping
That should have been sleeping,
They pour sleep on their head,
And sit down by their bed.
When wolves and tigers howl for prey,
They pitying stand and weep;
Seeking to drive their thirst away,
And keep them from the sheep.
But if they rush dreadful,
The angels, most heedful,
Receive each mild spirit,
New worlds to inherit.
And there the lion's ruddy eyes
Shall flow with tears of gold,
And pitying the tender cries,
And walking round the fold,
Saying, 'Wrath, by His meekness,
And, by His health, sickness
Is driven away
From our immortal day.
'And now beside thee, bleating lamb,
I can lie down and sleep;
Or think on Him who bore thy name,
Graze after thee and weep.
For, washed in life's river,
My bright mane for ever
Shall shine like the gold
As I guard o'er the fold.'"
1126,Emotion,NightPoemsAnyNightPoembyPhilipLevine,"Look, the eucalyptus, the Atlas pine,
the yellowing ash, all the trees
are gone, and I was older than
all of them. I am older than the moon,
than the stars that fill my plate,
than the unseen planets that huddle
together here at the end of a year
no one wanted. A year more than a year,
in which the sparrows learned
to fly backwards into eternity.
Their brothers and sisters saw this
and refuse to build nests. Before
the week is over they will all
have gone, and the chorus of love
that filled my yard and spilled
into my kitchen each evening
will be gone. I will have to learn
to sing in the voices of pure joy
and pure pain. I will have to forget
my name, my childhood, the years
under the cold dominion of the clock
so that this voice, torn and cracked,
can reach the low hills that shielded
the orange trees once. I will stand
on the back porch as the cold
drifts in, and sing, not for joy,
not for love, not even to be heard.
I will sing so that the darkness
can take hold and whatever
is left, the fallen fruit, the last
leaf, the puzzled squirrel, the child
far from home, lost, will believe
this could be any night. That boy,
walking alone, thinking of nothing
or reciting his favorite names
to the moon and stars, let him
find the home he left this morning,
let him hear a prayer out
of the raging mouth of the wind.
Let him repeat that prayer,
the prayer that night follows day,
that life follows death, that in time
we find our lives. Don't let him see
all that has gone. Let him love
the darkness. Look, he's running
and singing too. He could be happy."
1127,Emotion,NightPoemsThatTheNightComePoembyWilliamButlerYeats,"SHE lived in storm and strife,
Her soul had such desire
For what proud death may bring
That it could not endure
The common good of life,
But lived as 'twere a king

With banneret and pennon,
Trumpet and kettledrum,
And the outrageous cannon,
To bundle time away
That the night come."
1128,Emotion,NightPoemsHymnToTheNightPoembyHenryWadsworthLongfellow,"I heard the trailing garments of the Night
Sweep through her marble halls!
I saw her sable skirts all fringed with light
From the celestial walls!
I felt her presence, by its spell of might,
Stoop o'er me from above;
The calm, majestic presence of the Night,
As of the one I love.
I heard the sounds of sorrow and delight,
The manifold, soft chimes,
That fill the haunted chambers of the Night
Like some old poet's rhymes.
From the cool cisterns of the midnight air
My spirit drank repose;
The fountain of perpetual peace flows there,--
From those deep cisterns flows.
O holy Night! from thee I learn to bear
What man has borne before!
Thou layest thy finger on the lips of Care,
And they complain no more.
Peace!  Peace!  Orestes-like I breathe this prayer!
Descend with broad-winged flight,
The welcome, the thrice-prayed for, the most fair,
The best-beloved Night!"
1129,Emotion,NightPoemsSummerNightRiversidePoembySaraTeasdale,"In the wild soft summer darkness
How many and many a night we two together
Sat in the park and watched the Hudson
Wearing her lights like golden spangles
Glinting on black satin.
The rail along the curving pathway
Was low in a happy place to let us cross,
And down the hill a tree that dripped with bloom
Sheltered us,
While your kisses and the flowers,
Falling, falling,
Tangled in my hair. . . .
The frail white stars moved slowly over the sky.
And now, far off
In the fragrant darkness
The tree is tremulous again with bloom
For June comes back.
To-night what girl
Dreamily before her mirror shakes from her hair
This year's blossoms, clinging to its coils?"

Sunset at Night—is natural—
But Sunset on the Dawn

So Midnight's—due—at Noon.

1131,Emotion,NightPoemsNightWordsPoembyPhilipLevine,"after Juan Ramon
A child wakens in a cold apartment.
The windows are frosted. Outside he hears
words rising from the streets, words he cannot
understand, and then the semis gear down
for the traffic light on Houston. He sleeps
again and dreams of another city
on a high hill above a wide river
bathed in sunlight, and the dream is his life
as he will live it twenty years from now.
No, no, you say, dreams do not work that way,
they function otherwise. Perhaps in the world
you're right, but on Houston tonight two men
are trying to change a tire as snow gathers
on their shoulders and scalds their ungloved hands.
The older one, the father, is close to tears,
for he's sure his son, who's drunk, is laughing
secretly at him for all his failures
as a man and a father, and he is
laughing to himself but because he's happy
to be alone with his father as he was
years ago in another life where snow
never fell. At last he slips the tire iron
gently from his father's grip and kneels
down in the unstained snow and unbolts the wheel
while he sings of drinking a glass of wine,
the black common wine of Alicante,
in raw sunlight. Now the father joins in,
and the words rise between the falling flakes
only to be transformed into the music
spreading slowly over the oiled surface
of the river that runs through every child's dreams."
1132,Emotion,NightPoemsNightJourneyPoembyTheodoreRoethke,"Now as the train bears west,
Its rhythm rocks the earth,
And from my Pullman berth
I stare into the night
While others take their rest.
Bridges of iron lace,
A suddenness of trees,
A lap of mountain mist
All cross my line of sight,
Then a bleak wasted place,
And a lake below my knees.
Full on my neck I feel
The straining at a curve;
My muscles move with steel,
I wake in every nerve.
I watch a beacon swing
From dark to blazing bright;
We thunder through ravines
And gullies washed with light.
Beyond the mountain pass
Mist deepens on the pane;
We rush into a rain
That rattles double glass.
Wheels shake the roadbed stone,
The pistons jerk and shove,
I stay up half the night
To see the land I love."
1133,Emotion,NightPoemsSonnetLxviTheNightFloodRakesPoembyCharlotteSmith,"The night-flood rakes upon the stony shore;
Along the rugged cliffs and chalky caves
Mourns the hoarse Ocean, seeming to deplore
All that are buried in his restless waves—
Mined by corrosive tides, the hollow rock
Falls prone, and rushing from its turfy height,
Shakes the broad beach with long-resounding shock,
Loud thundering on the ear of sullen Night;
Above the desolate and stormy deep,
Gleams the wan Moon, by floating mist opprest;
Yet here while youth, and health, and labour sleep,
Alone I wander—Calm untroubled rest,
""Nature's soft nurse,"" deserts the sigh-swoln breast,
And shuns the eyes, that only wake to weep!"
1134,Emotion,NightPoemsVoicesOfTheNightPoembyHenryWadsworthLongfellow,"PRELUDE.
Pleasant it was, when woods were green,
And winds were soft and low,
To lie amid some sylvan scene,
Where, the long drooping boughs between
Shadows dark and sunlight sheen
Alternate come and go;
Or where the denser grove receives
No sunlight from above
But the dark foliage interweaves
In one unbroken roof of leaves,
Underneath whose sloping eaves
The shadows hardly move.
Beneath some patriarchal tree
I lay upon the ground;
His hoary arms uplifted he,
And all the broad leaves over me
Clapped their little hands in glee,
With one continuous sound;-
A slumberous sound,-a sound that brings
The feelings of a dream,-
As of innumerable wings,
As, when a bell no longer swings,
Faint the hollow murmur rings
O'er meadow, lake, and stream.
And dreams of that which cannot die,
Bright visins, came to me,
As lapped in thought I used to lie,
And gaze into the summer sky,
Where the sailing clouds went by,
Like ships upon the sea;
Dreams that the soul of youth engage
Ere Fancy has been quelled;
Old legends of the monkish page.
Traditions of the saint and sage,
Tales that have the rime of age,
And chronicles of Eld.
And, loving still these quaint old themes,
Even in the city's throng
I feel the freshness of the streams,
That, crossed by shades and sunny gleams,
Water the green land of dreams,
The holy land of song.
Therefore, at Pentecost, which brings
The Spring, clothed like a bride,
When nestling buds unfold their wings,
And bishop's-caps have golden rings,
Musing upon many things,
I sought the woodlands wide.
The green trees whispered low and mild,
It was a sound of joy!
They were my playmates when a child
And rocked me in their arms so wild!
Still they looked at me and smiled
As if I were a boy;
And ever whispered, mild and low,
""Come, be a child once more!""
And waved their long arms to and fro,
And beckoned solemnly and slow;
O, I could not choose but go
Into the woodlands hoar;
Into the blithe and breathing air,
Into the solemn wood.
Solemn and silent everywhere!
Nature with folded hands seemed there,
Kneeling at her evening prayer!
Like one in prayer I stood.
Before me rose an avenue
Of tall and sombrous pines;
Abroad their fan-like branches grew,
And, where the sunshine darted throught
Spread a vapor soft and blue,
In long and sloping lines.
And, falling on my weary brain,
Like a fast-falling shower,
The dreams of youth came back again,
Low lispings of the summer rain,
Dropping on the ripened grain,
As once upon the flower.
Visions of childhood!  Stay, O stay!
Ye were so sweet and wild!
And distant voices seemed to say,
""It cannot be! They pass away!
Other themes demand thy lay;
Thou art no more a child!
""The land of Song within thee lies,
Watered by living springs;
The lids of Fancy's sleepless eyes
Are gates unto that Paradise;
Holy thoughts, like stars, arise,
Its clouds are angels' wings.
""Learn, that henceforth thy song shall be
Not mountains capped with snow,
Nor forests sounding like the sea,
Nor rivers flowing ceaselessly,
Where the woodlands bend to see
The bending heavens below.
""There is a forest where the din
Of iron branches sounds!
A mighty river roara between,
And whosoever looks therein,
Sees the heavens all black with sin,-
Sees not ita depths, nor bounds.
""Athwart the swinging branches cast,
Soft rays of sunshine pour;
Then comes the fearful wintry blast;
Our hopes, like withered leaves, fall fast;
Pallid lips say, 'It is past!
We can return no more!'
""Look, then, into thine heart, and write!
Yes, into Life's deep stream!
All forms of sorrow and delight,
All solemn Voices of the Night,
That can soothe thee, or affright,-
Be these henceforth thy theme."""
1135,Emotion,NightPoemsASleeplessNightPoembyPhilipLevine,"April, and the last of the plum blossoms
scatters on the black grass
before dawn. The sycamore, the lime,
the struck pine inhale
the first pale hints of sky.
An iron day,
I think, yet it will come
dazzling, the light
rise from the belly of leaves and pour
burning from the cups
of poppies.
The mockingbird squawks
from his perch, fidgets,
and settles back. The snail, awake
for good, trembles from his shell
and sets sail for China. My hand dances
in the memory of a million vanished stars.
A man has every place to lay his head."
1136,Emotion,NightPoemsOnTheBeachAtNightPoembyWaltWhitman,"ON the beach, at night,
Stands a child, with her father,
Watching the east, the autumn sky.
Up through the darkness,
While ravening clouds, the burial clouds, in black masses spreading,
Lower, sullen and fast, athwart and down the sky,
Amid a transparent clear belt of ether yet left in the east,
Ascends, large and calm, the lord-star Jupiter;
And nigh at hand, only a very little above,
Swim the delicate brothers, the Pleiades.                          10
From the beach, the child, holding the hand of her father,
Those burial-clouds that lower, victorious, soon to devour all,
Watching, silently weeps.
Weep not, child,
Weep not, my darling,
With these kisses let me remove your tears;
The ravening clouds shall not long be victorious,
They shall not long possess the sky- shall devour the stars only in
apparition:
Jupiter shall emerge- be patient- watch again another night- the
Pleiades shall emerge,
They are immortal- all those stars, both silvery and golden, shall
shine out again,                                             20
The great stars and the little ones shall shine out again- they
endure;
The vast immortal suns, and the long-enduring pensive moons, shall
again shine.
Then, dearest child, mournest thou only for Jupiter?
Considerest thou alone the burial of the stars?
Something there is,
(With my lips soothing thee, adding, I whisper,
I give thee the first suggestion, the problem and indirection,)
Something there is more immortal even than the stars,
(Many the burials, many the days and nights, passing away,)
Something that shall endure longer even than lustrous Jupiter,     30
Longer than sun, or any revolving satellite,
Or the radiant brothers, the Pleiades."

Hard, lacing fingers, so I stand undone.
Of all my tears, the bitterest these are.
Who humbly followed Beauty all her ways,
Begging the brambles that her robe had passed,
Crying her name in corridors of stone,

Does not suffice him, once they are alone."

And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.
I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet
When far away an interrupted cry
Came over houses from another street,

Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.

water of a new life

Into the bosom of the earth,
Out of the Light's dominion,
Death's pains are but a bursting forth,
Sign of glad departure.
Swift in the narrow little boat,
Swift to the heavenly shore we float.
Blessed be the everlasting Night,
And blessed the endless slumber.
We are heated by the day too bright,
And withered up with care.
We're weary of a life abroad,
And we now want our Father's home.
What in this world should we all
Do with love and with faith?
That which is old is set aside,
And the new may perish also.
Alone he stands and sore downcast
Who loves with pious warmth the Past.
The Past where the light of the senses
In lofty flames did rise;
Where the Father's face and hand
All men did recognize;
And, with high sense, in simplicity
Many still fit the original pattern.
The Past wherein, still rich in bloom,
Man's strain did burgeon glorious,
And children, for the world to come,
Sought pain and death victorious,
And, through both life and pleasure spake,
Yet many a heart for love did break.
The Past, where to the flow of youth
God still showed himself,
And truly to an early death
Did commit his sweet life.
Fear and torture patiently he bore
So that he would be loved forever.
With anxious yearning now we see
That Past in darkness drenched,
With this world's water never we
Shall find our hot thirst quenched.
To our old home we have to go
That blessed time again to know.
What yet doth hinder our return
To loved ones long reposed?
Their grave limits our lives.
We are all sad and afraid.
We can search for nothing more --
The heart is full, the world is void.
Infinite and mysterious,
Thrills through us a sweet trembling --
As if from far there echoed thus
A sigh, our grief resembling.
Our loved ones yearn as well as we,
And sent to us this longing breeze.
Down to the sweet bride, and away
To the beloved Jesus.
Have courage, evening shades grow gray
To those who love and grieve.
A dream will dash our chains apart,
And lay us in the Father's lap."

1149,Emotion,NightPoemsAllSoulsNightPoembyWilliamButlerYeats,"Epilogue to 'A Vision'
MIDNIGHT has come, and the great Christ Church Bell
And may a lesser bell sound through the room;
And it is All Souls' Night,
And two long glasses brimmed with muscatel
Bubble upon the table.  A ghost may come;
For it is a ghost's right,
His element is so fine
Being sharpened by his death,
To drink from the wine-breath
While our gross palates drink from the whole wine.
I need some mind that, if the cannon sound
From every quarter of the world, can stay
Wound in mind's pondering
As mummies in the mummy-cloth are wound;
Because I have a marvellous thing to say,
A certain marvellous thing
None but the living mock,
Though not for sober ear;
It may be all that hear
Should laugh and weep an hour upon the clock.
Horton's the first I call.  He loved strange thought
And knew that sweet extremity of pride
That's called platonic love,
And that to such a pitch of passion wrought
Nothing could bring him, when his lady died,
Anodyne for his love.
Words were but wasted breath;
One dear hope had he:
The inclemency
Of that or the next winter would be death.
Two thoughts were so mixed up I could not tell
Whether of her or God he thought the most,
But think that his mind's eye,
When upward turned, on one sole image fell;
And that a slight companionable ghost,
Wild with divinity,
Had so lit up the whole
Immense miraculous house
The Bible promised us,
It seemed a gold-fish swimming in a bowl.
On Florence Emery I call the next,
Who finding the first wrinkles on a face
Admired and beautiful,
And knowing that the future would be vexed
With 'minished beauty, multiplied commonplace,
preferred to teach a school
Away from neighbour or friend,
Among dark skins, and there
permit foul years to wear
Hidden from eyesight to the unnoticed end.
Before that end much had she ravelled out
From a discourse in figurative speech
By some learned Indian
On the soul's journey.  How it is whirled about,
Wherever the orbit of the moon can reach,
Until it plunge into the sun;
And there, free and yet fast,
Being both Chance and Choice,
Forget its broken toys
And sink into its own delight at last.
And I call up MacGregor from the grave,
For in my first hard springtime we were friends.
Although of late estranged.
I thought him half a lunatic, half knave,
And told him so, but friendship never ends;
And what if mind seem changed,
And it seem changed with the mind,
When thoughts rise up unbid
On generous things that he did
And I grow half contented to be blind!
He had much industry at setting out,
Much boisterous courage, before loneliness
Had driven him crazed;
For meditations upon unknown thought
Make human intercourse grow less and less;
They are neither paid nor praised.
but he d object to the host,
The glass because my glass;
A ghost-lover he was
And may have grown more arrogant being a ghost.
But names are nothing.  What matter who it be,
So that his elements have grown so fine
The fume of muscatel
Can give his sharpened palate ecstasy
No living man can drink from the whole wine.
I have mummy truths to tell
Whereat the living mock,
Though not for sober ear,
For maybe all that hear
Should laugh and weep an hour upon the clock.
Such thought -- such thought have I that hold it tight
Till meditation master all its parts,
Nothing can stay my glance
Until that glance run in the world's despite
To where the damned have howled away their hearts,
And where the blessed dance;
Such thought, that in it bound
I need no other thing,
Wound in mind's wandering
As mummies in the mummy-cloth are wound."
1150,Emotion,NightPoemsASilentNightAHolyNightPoembyValsaGeorge,"The sun has set and the shadows fled
The feathered flocks, flown to their nest
Weary men after the day's toil and care
Are back home for sleep and rest
No bird sings and no beast strays
No tramp wanders and no lights shimmer
Silence rules and peace prevails
The sky is clear and the stars do glimmer
Buds unfold in shady glades
A sweet aroma pervades the air
Fluttering leaves sing a lullaby
And glow worms reel on wings of fire
Birds and beasts, in Nature's bosom rest
Babies nap, cuddling to their mothers tight
Tired men stretch out under quilts for ease
The world, asleep with dreams sweet and bright
A brief interlude from all angry strife
A time of farewell to all frivolous conceits
A holy night to bury our woes
And a God sent time to ease our spirits!"
1151,Emotion,NightPoemsInTheSecularNightPoembyMargaretAtwood,"In the secular night you wander around
alone in your house. It's two-thirty.
Everyone has deserted you,
or this is your story;
you remember it from being sixteen,
when the others were out somewhere, having a good time,
or so you suspected,
and you had to baby-sit.
You took a large scoop of vanilla ice-cream
and filled up the glass with grapejuice
and ginger ale, and put on Glenn Miller
with his big-band sound,
and lit a cigarette and blew the smoke up the chimney,
and cried for a while because you were not dancing,
and then danced, by yourself, your mouth circled with purple.
Now, forty years later, things have changed,
and it's baby lima beans.
It's necessary to reserve a secret vice.
This is what comes from forgetting to eat
at the stated mealtimes. You simmer them carefully,
drain, add cream and pepper,
and amble up and down the stairs,
scooping them up with your fingers right out of the bowl,
talking to yourself out loud.
You'd be surprised if you got an answer,
but that part will come later.
There is so much silence between the words,
you say. You say, The sensed absence
of God and the sensed presence
amount to much the same thing,
only in reverse.
You say, I have too much white clothing.
You start to hum.
Several hundred years ago
this could have been mysticism
or heresy. It isn't now.
Outside there are sirens.
Someone's been run over.
The century grinds on."
1152,Emotion,NightPoemsTheManWithNightSweatsPoembyThomGunn,"I wake up cold, I who
Prospered through dreams of heat
Wake to their residue,
Sweat, and a clinging sheet.
My flesh was its own shield:
Where it was gashed, it healed.
I grew as I explored
The body I could trust
Even while I adored
The risk that made robust,
A world of wonders in
Each challenge to the skin.
I cannot but be sorry
The given shield was cracked,
My mind reduced to hurry,
My flesh reduced and wrecked.
I have to change the bed,
But catch myself instead
Stopped upright where I am
Hugging my body to me
As if to shield it from
The pains that will go through me,
As if hands were enough
To hold an avalanche off."
1153,Emotion,NightPoemsNightPiecePoembyJamesJoyce,"Gaunt in gloom,
The pale stars their torches,
Enshrouded, wave.
Ghostfires from heaven's far verges faint illume,
Arches on soaring arches,
Night's sindark nave.
Seraphim,
The lost hosts awaken
To service till
In moonless gloom each lapses muted, dim,
Raised when she has and shaken
Her thurible.
And long and loud,
To night's nave upsoaring,
A starknell tolls
As the bleak incense surges, cloud on cloud,
Voidward from the adoring
Waste of souls."
1154,Emotion,NightPoemsAWinterNightPoembySaraTeasdale,"My window-pane is starred with frost,
The world is bitter cold to-night,
The moon is cruel, and the wind
Is like a two-edged sword to smite.
God pity all the homeless ones,
The beggars pacing to and fro.
God pity all the poor to-night
Who walk the lamp-lit streets of snow.
My room is like a bit of June,
Warm and close-curtained fold on fold,
But somewhere, like a homeless child,
My heart is crying in the cold."
1155,Emotion,NightPoemsTheStarlightNightPoembyGerardManleyHopkins,"Look at the stars! look, look up at the skies!
O look at all the fire-folk sitting in the air!
The bright boroughs, the circle-citadels there!
Down in dim woods the diamond delves! the elves'-eyes!
The grey lawns cold where gold, where quickgold lies!
Wind-beat whitebeam! airy abeles set on a flare!
Flake-doves sent floating forth at a farmyard scare! --
Ah well! it is all a purchase, all is a prize.
Buy then! bid then! -- What? -- Prayer, patience, alms, vows.
Look, look: a May-mess, like on orchard boughs!
Look! March-bloom, like on mealed-with-yellow sallows!
These are indeed the barn; withindoors house
The shocks. This piece-bright paling shuts the spouse
Christ home, Christ and his mother and all his hallows."
1156,Emotion,NightPoemsDayAndNightPoembyRupertBrooke,"Through my heart's palace Thoughts unnumbered throng;
And there, most quiet and, as a child, most wise,
High-throned you sit, and gracious.  All day long
Great Hopes gold-armoured, jester Fantasies,
And pilgrim Dreams, and little beggar Sighs,
Bow to your benediction, go their way.
And the grave jewelled courtier Memories
Worship and love and tend you, all the day.
But when I sleep, and all my thoughts go straying,
When the high session of the day is ended,
And darkness comes; then, with the waning light,
By lilied maidens on your way attended,
Proud from the wonted throne, superbly swaying,
You, like a queen, pass out into the night."
1157,Emotion,NightPoemsOnTheBeachAtNightAlonePoembyWaltWhitman,"ON the beach at night alone,
As the old mother sways her to and fro, singing her husky song,
As I watch the bright stars shining--I think a thought of the clef of
the universes, and of the future.
A VAST SIMILITUDE interlocks all,
All spheres, grown, ungrown, small, large, suns, moons, planets,
comets, asteroids,
All the substances of the same, and all that is spiritual upon the
same,
All distances of place, however wide,
All distances of time--all inanimate forms,
All Souls--all living bodies, though they be ever so different, or in
different worlds,
All gaseous, watery, vegetable, mineral processes--the fishes, the
brutes,                                                      10
All men and women--me also;
All nations, colors, barbarisms, civilizations, languages;
All identities that have existed, or may exist, on this globe, or any
globe;
All lives and deaths--all of the past, present, future;
This vast similitude spans them, and always has spann'd, and shall
forever span them, and compactly hold them, and enclose them."
1158,Emotion,NightPoemsTheWoodsAtNightPoembyMaySwenson,"The binocular owl,
fastened to a limb
like a lantern
all night long,
sees where all
the other birds sleep:
towhee under leaves,
titmouse deep
in a twighouse,
sapsucker gripped
to a knothole lip,
redwing in the reeds,
swallow in the willow,
flicker in the oak -
but cannot see poor
whippoorwill
under the hill
in deadbrush nest,
who's awake, too -
with stricken eye
flayed by the moon
her brindled breast
repeats, repeats, repeats its plea
for cruelty."

1160,Emotion,NightPoemsANovemberNightPoembySaraTeasdale,"There!  See the line of lights,
A chain of stars down either side the street --
Why can't you lift the chain and give it to me,
A necklace for my throat?  I'd twist it round
And you could play with it.  You smile at me
As though I were a little dreamy child
Behind whose eyes the fairies live. . . .  And see,
The people on the street look up at us
All envious.  We are a king and queen,
Our royal carriage is a motor bus,
We watch our subjects with a haughty joy. . . .
How still you are!  Have you been hard at work
And are you tired to-night?  It is so long
Since I have seen you -- four whole days, I think.
My heart is crowded full of foolish thoughts
Like early flowers in an April meadow,
And I must give them to you, all of them,
Before they fade.  The people I have met,
The play I saw, the trivial, shifting things
That loom too big or shrink too little, shadows
That hurry, gesturing along a wall,
Haunting or gay -- and yet they all grow real
And take their proper size here in my heart
When you have seen them. . . .  There's the Plaza now,
A lake of light!  To-night it almost seems
That all the lights are gathered in your eyes,
Drawn somehow toward you.  See the open park
Lying below us with a million lamps
Scattered in wise disorder like the stars.
We look down on them as God must look down
On constellations floating under Him
Tangled in clouds. . . .  Come, then, and let us walk
Since we have reached the park.  It is our garden,
All black and blossomless this winter night,
But we bring April with us, you and I;
We set the whole world on the trail of spring.
I think that every path we ever took
Has marked our footprints in mysterious fire,
Delicate gold that only fairies see.
When they wake up at dawn in hollow tree-trunks
And come out on the drowsy park, they look
Along the empty paths and say, ""Oh, here
They went, and here, and here, and here!  Come, see,
Here is their bench, take hands and let us dance
About it in a windy ring and make
A circle round it only they can cross
When they come back again!"" . . .  Look at the lake --
Do you remember how we watched the swans
That night in late October while they slept?
Swans must have stately dreams, I think.  But now
The lake bears only thin reflected lights
That shake a little.  How I long to take
One from the cold black water -- new-made gold
To give you in your hand!  And see, and see,
There is a star, deep in the lake, a star!
Oh, dimmer than a pearl -- if you stoop down
Your hand could almost reach it up to me. . . .
There was a new frail yellow moon to-night --
I wish you could have had it for a cup
With stars like dew to fill it to the brim. . . .
How cold it is!  Even the lights are cold;
They have put shawls of fog around them, see!
What if the air should grow so dimly white
That we would lose our way along the paths
Made new by walls of moving mist receding
The more we follow. . . .  What a silver night!
That was our bench the time you said to me
The long new poem -- but how different now,
How eerie with the curtain of the fog
Making it strange to all the friendly trees!
There is no wind, and yet great curving scrolls
Carve themselves, ever changing, in the mist.
Walk on a little, let me stand here watching
To see you, too, grown strange to me and far. . . .
I used to wonder how the park would be
If one night we could have it all alone --
No lovers with close arm-encircled waists
To whisper and break in upon our dreams.
And now we have it!  Every wish comes true!
We are alone now in a fleecy world;
Even the stars have gone.  We two alone!
Submitted by Venus"
1161,Emotion,NightPoemsDeepInTheNightPoembySaraTeasdale,"Deep in the night the cry of a swallow,
Under the stars he flew,
Keen as pain was his call to follow
Over the world to you.
Love in my heart is a cry forever
Lost as the swallow's flight,
Seeking for you and never, never
Stilled by the stars at night."
1162,Emotion,NightPoemsTheNightGamePoembyRobertPinsky,"Some of us believe
We would have conceived romantic
Love out of our own passions
With no precedents,
Without songs and poetry--
Or have invented poetry and music
As a comb of cells for the honey.
Shaped by ignorance,
A succession of new worlds,
Congruities improvised by
Immigrants or children.
I once thought most people were Italian,
Jewish or Colored.
To be white and called
Something like Ed Ford
Seemed aristocratic,
A rare distinction.
Possibly I believed only gentiles
And blonds could be left-handed.
Already famous
After one year in the majors,
Whitey Ford was drafted by the Army
To play ball in the flannels
Of the Signal Corps, stationed
In Long Branch, New Jersey.
A night game, the silver potion
Of the lights, his pink skin
Shining like a burn.
Never a player
I liked or hated:  a Yankee,
A mere success.
But white the chalked-off lines
In the grass, white and green
The immaculate uniform,
And white the unpigmented
Halo of his hair
When he shifted his cap:
So ordinary and distinct,
So close up, that I felt
As if I could have made him up,
Imagined him as I imagined
The ball, a scintilla
High in the black backdrop
Of the sky.  Tight red stitches.
Rawlings.  The bleached
Horsehide white:  the color
Of nothing.  Color of the past
And of the future, of the movie screen
At rest and of blank paper.
""I could have.""  The mind.  The black
Backdrop, the white
Fly picked out by the towering
Lights.  A few years later
On a blanket in the grass
By the same river
A girl and I came into
Being together
To the faint muttering
Of unthinkable
Troubadours and radios.
The emerald
Theater, the night.
Another time,
I devised a left-hander
Even more gifted
Than Whitey Ford:  A Dodger.
People were amazed by him.
Once, when he was young,
He refused to pitch on Yom Kippur."
1163,Emotion,NightPoemsSilentSilentNightPoembyWilliamBlake,"Silent, silent night,
Quench the holy light
Of thy torches bright;
For possessed of Day
Thousand spirits stray
That sweet joys betray.
Why should joys be sweet
Used with deceit,
Nor with sorrows meet?
But an honest joy
Does itself destroy
For a harlot coy."
1164,Emotion,NightPoemsNightIsMySisterAndHowDeepInLovePoembyEdnaStVincentMillay,"Night is my sister, and how deep in love,
How drowned in love and weedily washed ashore,
There to be fretted by the drag and shove
At the tide's edge, I lie—these things and more:
Whose arm alone between me and the sand,
Whose voice alone, whose pitiful breath brought near,
Could thaw these nostrils and unlock this hand,
She could advise you, should you care to hear.
Small chance, however, in a storm so black,
A man will leave his friendly fire and snug
For a drowned woman's sake, and bring her back
To drip and scatter shells upon the rug.
No one but Night, with tears on her dark face,
Watches beside me in this windy place."
1165,Emotion,NightPoemsTheNightPoembyAlexanderSergeyevichPushkin,"My voice that is for you the languid one, and gentle,
Disturbs the velvet of the dark night's mantle,
By my bedside, a candle, my sad guard,
Burns, and my poems ripple and merge in flood --
And run the streams of love, run, full of you alone,
And in the dark, your eyes shine like the precious stones,
And smile to me, and hear I the voice:
My friend, my sweetest friend... I love... I'm yours... I'm yours!"
1166,Emotion,NightPoemsByNightWhenOthersSoundlySleptPoembyAnneBradstreet,".      By night when others soundly slept
And hath at once both ease and Rest,
My waking eyes were open kept
And so to lie I found it best.
.
I sought him whom my Soul did Love,
With tears I sought him earnestly.
He bow'd his ear down from Above.
In vain I did not seek or cry.
.
My hungry Soul he fill'd with Good;
He in his Bottle put my tears,
My smarting wounds washt in his blood,
And banisht thence my Doubts and fears.

What to my Saviour shall I give
Who freely hath done this for me?
I'll serve him here whilst I shall live
And Loue him to Eternity"
1167,Emotion,NightPoemsAndyTheNightWatchPoembyEdgarLeeMasters,"In my Spanish cloak,
And old slouch hat,
And overshoes of felt,
And Tyke, my faithful dog,
And my knotted hickory cane,
I slipped about with a bull's-eye lantern
From door to door on the square,
As the midnight stars wheeled round,
And the bell in the steeple murmured
From the blowing of the wind;
And the weary steps of old Doc Hill
Sounded like one who walks in sleep,
And a far-off rooster crew.
And now another is watching Spoon River
As others watched before me.
And here we lie, Doc Hill and I
Where none breaks through and steals,
And no eye needs to guard."
1168,Emotion,NightPoemsAnOldMansWinterNightPoembyRobertFrost,"All out of doors looked darkly in at him
Through the thin frost, almost in separate stars,
That gathers on the pane in empty rooms.
What kept his eyes from giving back the gaze
Was the lamp tilted near them in his hand.
What kept him from remembering what it was
That brought him to that creaking room was age.
He stood with barrels round him -- at a loss.
And having scared the cellar under him
In clomping there, he scared it once again
In clomping off; -- and scared the outer night,
Which has its sounds, familiar, like the roar
Of trees and crack of branches, common things,
But nothing so like beating on a box.
A light he was to no one but himself
Where now he sat, concerned with he knew what,
A quiet light, and then not even that.
He consigned to the moon, such as she was,
So late-arising, to the broken moon
As better than the sun in any case
For such a charge, his snow upon the roof,
His icicles along the wall to keep;
And slept. The log that shifted with a jolt
Once in the stove, disturbed him and he shifted,
And eased his heavy breathing, but still slept.
One aged man -- one man -- can't keep a house,
A farm, a countryside, or if he can,
It's thus he does it of a winter night."
1169,Emotion,NightPoemsMondayNightMay11th1846DomesticPeacePoembyAnneBrontë,"Why should such gloomy silence reign;
And why is all the house so drear,
When neither danger, sickness, pain,
Nor death, nor want have entered here?
We are as many as we were
That other night, when all were gay,
And full of hope, and free from care;
Yet, is there something gone away.
The moon without as pure and calm
Is shining as that night she shone;
but now, to us she brings no balm,
For something from our hearts is gone.
Something whose absence leaves a void,
A cheerless want in every heart.
Each feels the bliss of all destroyed
And mourns the change - but each apart.
The fire is burning in the grate
As redly as it used to burn,
But still the hearth is desolate
Till Mirth and Love with Peace return.
'Twas Peace that flowed from heart to heart
With looks and smiles that spoke of Heaven,
And gave us language to impart
The blissful thoughts itself had given.
Sweet child of Heaven, and joy of earth!
O, when will Man thy value learn?
We rudely drove thee from our hearth,
And vainly sigh for thy return."
1170,Emotion,NightPoemsNightOYouWhoseCountenancePoembyRainerMariaRilke,"Night. O you whose countenance, dissolved
in deepness, hovers above my face.
You who are the heaviest counterweight
to my astounding contemplation.
Night, that trembles as reflected in my eyes,
but in itself strong;
inexhaustible creation, dominant,
enduring beyond the earth's endurance;
Night, full of newly created stars that leave
trails of fire streaming from their seams
as they soar in inaudible adventure
through interstellar space:
how, overshadowed by your all-embracing vastness,
I appear minute!---
Yet, being one with the ever more darkening earth,
I dare to be in you.

1171,Emotion,NightPoemsSpringNightPoembySaraTeasdale,"The park is filled with night and fog,
The veils are drawn about the world,
The drowsy lights along the paths
Are dim and pearled.
Gold and gleaming the empty streets,
gold and gleaming the misty lake,
The mirrored lights like sunken swords,
Glimmer and shake.
Oh, is it not enought to be
Here with this beauty over me?
My throat should ache with praise, and I
Should kneel in joy beneath the sky.
O, Beauty are you not enough?
Why am I crying after love,
With youth, a singing voice and eyes
To take earth's wonder with surprise?
Why have I put off my pride,
Why am I unsatisfied,--
I for whom the pensive night
Binds her cloudy hair with light,--
I, for whom all beauty burns
Like incense in a million urns?
O, Beauty, are you not enough?
Why am I crying after love?"
1172,Emotion,NightPoemsAtNightChinamenJumpPoembyFrankOHara,"At night Chinamen jump
on Asia with a thump
while in our willful way
we, in secret, play
affectionate games and bruise
our knees like China's shoes.
The birds push apples through
grass the moon turns blue,
these apples roll beneath
our buttocks like a heath
full of Chinese thrushes
flushed from China's bushes.
As we love at night
birds sing out of sight,
Chinese rhythms beat
through us in our heat,
the apples and the birds
move us like soft words,
we couple in the grace
of that mysterious race."
1173,Emotion,NightPoemsNightPoembyPercyByssheShelley,"SWIFTLY walk o'er the western wave,
Spirit of Night!
Out of the misty eastern cave,--
Where, all the long and lone daylight,
Thou wovest dreams of joy and fear
Which make thee terrible and dear,--
Swift be thy flight!
Wrap thy form in a mantle grey,
Star-inwrought!
Blind with thine hair the eyes of Day;
Kiss her until she be wearied out.
Then wander o'er city and sea and land,
Touching all with thine opiate wand--
Come, long-sought!
When I arose and saw the dawn,
I sigh'd for thee;
When light rode high, and the dew was gone,
And noon lay heavy on flower and tree,
And the weary Day turn'd to his rest,
Lingering like an unloved guest,
I sigh'd for thee.
Thy brother Death came, and cried,
'Wouldst thou me?'
Thy sweet child Sleep, the filmy-eyed,
Murmur'd like a noontide bee,
'Shall I nestle near thy side?
Wouldst thou me?'--And I replied,
'No, not thee!'
Death will come when thou art dead,
Soon, too soon--
Sleep will come when thou art fled.
Of neither would I ask the boon
I ask of thee, beloved Night--
Swift be thine approaching flight,
Come soon, soon!"

Five billion miles away, a galaxy dies
like a snowflake falling on water.  Below us,

All night, the cities, like shimmering novas,
tug with bright streets at lonely lights like his."

1177,Emotion,NightPoemsTheNightPoembyHilaireBelloc,"Most Holy Night, that still dost keep
The keys of all the doors of sleep,
To me when my tired eyelids close
Give thou repose.
And let the far lament of them
That chaunt the dead day’s requiem
Make in my ears, who wakeful lie,
Soft lullaby.
Let them that guard the hornàed Moon
By my bedside their memories croon.
So shall I have new dreams and blest
In my brief rest.
Fold thy great wings about my face,
Hide day-dawn from my resting-place,
And cheat me with thy false delight,
Most Holy Night."
1178,Emotion,NightPoemsANightPiecePoembyWilliamWordsworth,"------The sky is overcast
With a continuous cloud of texture close,
Heavy and wan, all whitened by the Moon,
Which through that veil is indistinctly seen,
A dull, contracted circle, yielding light
So feebly spread, that not a shadow falls,
Chequering the ground--from rock, plant, tree, or tower.
At length a pleasant instantaneous gleam
Startles the pensive traveller while he treads
His lonesome path, with unobserving eye
Bent earthwards; he looks up--the clouds are split
Asunder,--and above his head he sees
The clear Moon, and the glory of the heavens.
There, in a black-blue vault she sails along,
Followed by multitudes of stars, that, small
And sharp, and bright, along the dark abyss
Drive as she drives: how fast they wheel away,
Yet vanish not!--the wind is in the tree,
But they are silent;--still they roll along
Immeasurably distant; and the vault,
Built round by those white clouds, enormous clouds,
Still deepens its unfathomable depth.
At length the Vision closes; and the mind,
Not undisturbed by the delight it feels,
Which slowly settles into peaceful calm,
Is left to muse upon the solemn scene."
1179,Emotion,NightPoemsAtNightPoembySaraTeasdale,"We are apart; the city grows quiet between us,
She hushes herself, for midnight makes heavy her eyes,
The tangle of traffic is ended, the cars are empty,
Five streets divide us, and on them the moonlight lies.
Oh are you asleep, or lying awake, my lover?
Open your dreams to my love and your heart to my words.
I send you my thoughts--the air between us is laden,
My thoughts fly in at your window, a flock of wild birds."

Makes effort at conclusion
Assisted faint of Love."

A Night—there lay the Days between—
The Day that was Before—

Too imperceptible to note—
Till it be night—no more—"
1182,Emotion,NightPoemsTheNightInIslaNegraPoembyPabloNeruda,"Ancient night and the unruly salt
beat at the walls of my house.
The shadow is all one, the sky
throbs now along with the ocean,
and sky and shadow erupt
in the crash of their vast conflict.
All night long they struggle;
nobody knows the name
of the harsh light that keeps slowly opening
like a languid fruit.
So on the coast comes to light,
out of seething shadow, the harsh dawn,
gnawed at by the moving salt,
swept clean by the mass of night,
bloodstained in its sea-washed crater."
1183,Emotion,NightPoemsCottersSaturdayNightThePoembyRobertBurns,"Inscribed to Robert Aiken, Esq.
Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,
Their homely joys and destiny obscure;
Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile,
The short and simple annals of the poor.
(Gray, ""Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard"")
My lov'd, my honour'd, much respected friend!
No mercenary bard his homage pays;
With honest pride, I scorn each selfish end:
My dearest meed a friend's esteem and praise.
To you I sing, in simple Scottish lays,
The lowly train in life's sequester'd scene;
The native feelings strong, the guileless ways;
What Aiken in a cottage would have been;
Ah! tho' his worth unknown, far happier there, I ween!
November chill blaws loud wi' angry sugh,
The short'ning winter day is near a close;
The miry beasts retreating frae the pleugh,
The black'ning trains o' craws to their repose;
The toil-worn Cotter frae his labour goes,--
This night his weekly moil is at an end,--
Collects his spades, his mattocks and his hoes,
Hoping the morn in ease and rest to spend,
And weary, o'er the moor, his course does hameward bend.
At length his lonely cot appears in view,
Beneath the shelter of an aged tree;
Th' expectant wee-things, toddlin, stacher through
To meet their dad, wi' flichterin noise an' glee.
His wee bit ingle, blinkin bonilie,
His clean hearth-stane, his thrifty wifie's smile,
The lisping infant prattling on his knee,
Does a' his weary kiaugh and care beguile,
An' makes him quite forget his labour an' his toil.
Belyve, the elder bairns come drapping in,
At service out, amang the farmers roun';
Some ca' the pleugh, some herd, some tentie rin
A cannie errand to a neibor toun:
Their eldest hope, their Jenny, woman-grown,
In youthfu' bloom, love sparkling in her e'e,
Comes hame, perhaps, to shew a braw new gown,
Or deposite her sair-won penny-fee,
To help her parents dear, if they in hardship be.
With joy unfeign'd, brothers and sisters meet,
An' each for other's weelfare kindly spiers:
The social hours, swift-wing'd, unnotic'd fleet;
Each tells the uncos that he sees or hears.
The parents partial eye their hopeful years;
Anticipation forward points the view;
The mother, wi' her needle an' her sheers,
Gars auld claes look amaist as weel's the new;
The father mixes a' wi' admonition due.
Their master's an' their mistress's command
The younkers a' are warned to obey;
An' mind their labours wi' an eydent hand,
An' ne'er tho' out o' sight, to jauk or play:
""An' O! be sure to fear the Lord alway,
An' mind your duty, duly, morn an' night!
Lest in temptation's path ye gang astray,
Implore his counsel and assisting might:
They never sought in vain that sought the Lord aright!""
But hark! a rap comes gently to the door.
Jenny, wha kens the meaning o' the same,
Tells how a neebor lad cam o'er the moor,
To do some errands, and convoy her hame.
The wily mother sees the conscious flame
Sparkle in Jenny's e'e, and flush her cheek;
Wi' heart-struck, anxious care, inquires his name,
While Jenny hafflins is afraid to speak;
Weel-pleas'd the mother hears, it's nae wild, worthless rake.
Wi' kindly welcome Jenny brings him ben,
A strappin youth; he takes the mother's eye;
Blythe Jenny sees the visit's no ill taen;
The father cracks of horses, pleughs, and kye.
The youngster's artless heart o'erflows wi' joy,
But, blate and laithfu', scarce can weel behave;
The mother wi' a woman's wiles can spy
What maks the youth sae bashfu' an' sae grave,
Weel pleas'd to think her bairn's respected like the lave.
O happy love! where love like this is found!
O heart-felt raptures! bliss beyond compare!
I've paced much this weary, mortal round,
And sage experience bids me this declare--
""If Heaven a draught of heavenly pleasure spare,
One cordial in this melancholy vale,
'Tis when a youthful, loving, modest pair,
In other's arms breathe out the tender tale,
Beneath the milk-white thorn that scents the ev'ning gale.""
Is there, in human form, that bears a heart,
A wretch! a villain! lost to love and truth!
That can with studied, sly, ensnaring art
Betray sweet Jenny's unsuspecting youth?
Curse on his perjur'd arts! dissembling smooth!
Are honour, virtue, conscience, all exil'd?
Is there no pity, no relenting truth,
Points to the parents fondling o'er their child,
Then paints the ruin'd maid, and their distraction wild?
But now the supper crowns their simple board,
The halesome parritch, chief of Scotia's food;
The soupe their only hawkie does afford,
That yont the hallan snugly chows her cud.
The dame brings forth, in complimental mood,
To grace the lad, her weel-hain'd kebbuck fell,
An' aft he's prest, an' aft he ca's it guid;
The frugal wifie, garrulous, will tell,
How 'twas a towmond auld, sin' lint was i' the bell.
The cheerfu' supper done, wi' serious face,
They round the ingle form a circle wide;
The sire turns o'er, with patriarchal grace,
The big ha'-Bible, ance his father's pride;
His bonnet rev'rently is laid aside,
His lyart haffets wearing thin and bare;
Those strains that once did sweet in Zion glide,
He wales a portion with judicious care;
And, ""Let us worship God,"" he says with solemn air.
They chant their artless notes in simple guise;
They tune their hearts, by far the noblest aim:
Perhaps Dundee's wild-warbling measures rise,
Or plaintive Martyrs, worthy of the name,
Or noble Elgin beets the heaven-ward flame,
The sweetest far of Scotia's holy lays.
Compar'd with these, Italian trills are tame;
The tickl'd ear no heart-felt raptures raise;
Nae unison hae they, with our Creator's praise.
The priest-like father reads the sacred page,
How Abram was the friend of God on high;
Or Moses bade eternal warfare wage
With Amalek's ungracious progeny;
Or how the royal bard did groaning lie
Beneath the stroke of Heaven's avenging ire;
Or Job's pathetic plaint, and wailing cry;
Or rapt Isaiah's wild, seraphic fire;
Or other holy seers that tune the sacred lyre.
Perhaps the Christian volume is the theme,
How guiltless blood for guilty man was shed;
How He, who bore in Heaven the second name
Had not on earth whereon to lay His head:
How His first followers and servants sped;
The precepts sage they wrote to many a land:
How he, who lone in Patmos banished,
Saw in the sun a mighty angel stand,
And heard great Bab'lon's doom pronounc'd by Heaven's command.
Then kneeling down to Heaven's Eternal King,
The saint, the father, and the husband prays:
Hope ""springs exulting on triumphant wing,""
That thus they all shall meet in future days:
There ever bask in uncreated rays,
No more to sigh or shed the bitter tear,
Together hymning their Creator's praise,
In such society, yet still more dear,
While circling Time moves round in an eternal sphere.
Compar'd with this, how poor Religion's pride
In all the pomp of method and of art,
When men display to congregations wide
Devotion's ev'ry grace except the heart!
The Pow'r, incens'd, the pageant will desert,
The pompous strain, the sacerdotal stole;
But haply in some cottage far apart
May hear, well pleas'd, the language of the soul,
And in His Book of Life the inmates poor enrol.
Then homeward all take off their sev'ral way;
The youngling cottagers retire to rest;
The parent-pair their secret homage pay,
And proffer up to Heav'n the warm request,
That He who stills the raven's clam'rous nest,
And decks the lily fair in flow'ry pride,
Would, in the way His wisdom sees the best,
For them and for their little ones provide;
But chiefly, in their hearts with grace divine preside.
From scenes like these old Scotia's grandeur springs,
That makes her lov'd at home, rever'd abroad:
Princes and lords are but the breath of kings,
""An honest man's the noblest work of God"":
And certes, in fair Virtue's heavenly road,
The cottage leaves the palace far behind:
What is a lordling's pomp? a cumbrous load,
Disguising oft the wretch of human kind,
Studied in arts of hell, in wickedness refin'd!
O Scotia! my dear, my native soil!
For whom my warmest wish to Heaven is sent!
Long may thy hardy sons of rustic toil
Be blest with health, and peace, and sweet content!
And, oh! may Heaven their simple lives prevent
From luxury's contagion, weak and vile!
Then, howe'er crowns and coronets be rent,
A virtuous populace may rise the while,
And stand a wall of fire around their much-lov'd isle.
O Thou! who pour'd the patriotic tide
That stream'd thro' Wallace's undaunted heart,
Who dar'd to nobly stem tyrannic pride,
Or nobly die, the second glorious part,--
(The patriot's God peculiarly thou art,
His friend, inspirer, guardian, and reward!)
O never, never Scotia's realm desert,
But still the patriot, and the patriot-bard,
In bright succession raise, her ornament and guard!"
1184,Emotion,NightPoemsWinterNightPoembyBorisPasternak,"It snowed and snowed ,the whole world over,
Snow swept the world from end to end.
A candle burned on the table;
A candle burned.
As during summer midges swarm
To beat their wings against a flame
Out in the yard the snowflakes swarmed
To beat against the window pane
The blizzard sculptured on the glass
Designs of arrows and of whorls.
A candle burned on the table;
A candle burned.
Distorted shadows fell
Upon the lighted ceiling:
Shadows of crossed arms,of crossed legs-
Of crossed destiny.
Two tiny shoes fell to the floor
And thudded.
A candle on a nightstand shed wax tears
Upon a dress.
All things vanished within
The snowy murk-white,hoary.
A candle burned on the table;
A candle burned.
A corner draft fluttered the flame
And the white fever of temptation
Upswept its angel wings that cast
A cruciform shadow
It snowed hard throughout the month
Of February, and almost constantly
A candle burned on the table;
A candle burned."
1185,Emotion,NightPoemsTheChildrenOfTheNightPoembyEdwinArlingtonRobinson,"For those that never know the light,
The darkness is a sullen thing;
And they, the Children of the Night,
Seem lost in Fortune's winnowing.
But some are strong and some are weak, --
And there's the story. House and home
Are shut from countless hearts that seek
World-refuge that will never come.
And if there be no other life,
And if there be no other chance
To weigh their sorrow and their strife
Than in the scales of circumstance,
'T were better, ere the sun go down
Upon the first day we embark,
In life's imbittered sea to drown,
Than sail forever in the dark.
But if there be a soul on earth
So blinded with its own misuse
Of man's revealed, incessant worth,
Or worn with anguish, that it views
No light but for a mortal eye,
No rest but of a mortal sleep,
No God but in a prophet's lie,
No faith for ""honest doubt"" to keep;
If there be nothing, good or bad,
But chaos for a soul to trust, --
God counts it for a soul gone mad,
And if God be God, He is just.
And if God be God, He is Love;
And though the Dawn be still so dim,
It shows us we have played enough
With creeds that make a fiend of Him.
There is one creed, and only one,
That glorifies God's excellence;
So cherish, that His will be done,
The common creed of common sense.
It is the crimson, not the gray,
That charms the twilight of all time;
It is the promise of the day
That makes the starry sky sublime;
It is the faith within the fear
That holds us to the life we curse; --
So let us in ourselves revere
The Self which is the Universe!
Let us, the Children of the Night,
Put off the cloak that hides the scar!
Let us be Children of the Light,
And tell the ages what we are!"
1186,Emotion,NightPoemsGoodNightPoembyPercyByssheShelley,"Good-night? ah! no; the hour is ill
Which severs those it should unite;
Let us remain together still,
Then it will be good night.
How can I call the lone night good,
Though thy sweet wishes wing its flight?
Be it not said, thought, understood --
Then it will be -- good night.
To hearts which near each other move
From evening close to morning light,
The night is good; because, my love,
They never say good-night."
1187,Emotion,NightPoemsPrairieWatersByNightPoembyCarlSandburg,"Chatter of birds two by two raises a night song joining a litany of running water--sheer waters
showing the russet of old stones remembering many rains.
And the long willows drowse on the shoulders of the running water, and sleep from much music;
joined songs of day-end, feathery throats and stony waters, in a choir chanting new psalms.
It is too much for the long willows when low laughter of a red moon comes down; and the willows
drowse and sleep on the shoulders of the running water."
1188,Emotion,NightPoemsOfHimILoveDayAndNightPoembyWaltWhitman,"OF him I love day and night, I dream'd I heard he was dead;
And I dream'd I went where they had buried him I love--but he was not
in that place;
And I dream'd I wander'd, searching among burial-places, to find him;
And I found that every place was a burial-place;
The houses full of life were equally full of death, (this house is
now;)
The streets, the shipping, the places of amusement, the Chicago,
Boston, Philadelphia, the Mannahatta, were as full of the dead
as of the living,
And fuller, O vastly fuller, of the dead than of the living;
--And what I dream'd I will henceforth tell to every person and age,
And I stand henceforth bound to what I dream'd;
And now I am willing to disregard burial-places, and dispense with
them;                                                        10
And if the memorials of the dead were put up indifferently
everywhere, even in the room where I eat or sleep, I should be
satisfied;
And if the corpse of any one I love, or if my own corpse, be duly
render'd to powder, and pour'd in the sea, I shall be
satisfied;
Or if it be distributed to the winds, I shall be satisfied."
1189,Emotion,NightPoemsTheBreathOfNightPoembyRandallJarrell,"The moon rises. The red cubs rolling
In the ferns by the rotten oak
Stare over a marsh and a meadow
To the farm's white wisp of smoke.
A spark burns, high in heaven.
Deer thread the blossoming rows
Of the old orchard, rabbits
Hop by the well-curb. The cock crows
From the tree by the widow's walk;
Two stars in the trees to the west,
Are snared, and an owl's soft cry
Runs like a breath through the forest.
Here too, though death is hushed, though joy
Obscures, like night, their wars,
The beings of this world are swept
By the Strife that moves the stars."
1190,Emotion,NightPoemsAtTheMidHourOfNightPoembyThomasMoore,"At the mid hour of night, when stars are weeping, I fly
To the lone vale we loved, when life shone warm in thine eye;
And I think oft, if spirits can steal from the regions of air,
To revisit past scenes of delight, thou wilt come to me there,
And tell me our love is remember'd, even in the sky.
Then I sing the wild song 'twas once such pleasure to hear!
When our voices commingling breathed, like one, on the ear;
And, as Echo far off through the vale my said orison rolls,
I think, oh my love! 'tis thy voice from the Kingdom of Souls,
Faintly answering still the notes that once were so dear."
1191,Emotion,NightPoemsDecemberNightPoembyWilliamStanleyMerwin,"The cold slope is standing in darkness
But the south of the trees is dry to the touch
The heavy limbs climb into the moonlight bearing feathers
I came to watch these
White plants older at night
The oldest
Come first to the ruins
And I hear magpies kept awake by the moon
The water flows through its
Own fingers without end
Tonight once more
I find a single prayer and it is not for men"
1192,Emotion,NightPoemsAtNightOnTheHighSeasPoembyHermannHesse,"At night, when the sea cradles me
And the pale star gleam
Lies down on its broad waves,
Then I free myself wholly
From all activity and all the love
And stand silent and breathe purely,
Alone, alone cradled by the sea
That lies there, cold and silent, with a thousand lights.
Then I have to think of my friends
And my gaze sinks into their gazes
And I ask each one, silent, alone:
""Are you still mine""
Is my sorrow a sorrow to you, my death a death?
Do you feel from my love, my grief,
Just a breath, just an echo?""
And the sea peacefully gazes back, silent,
And smiles: no.
And no greeting and now answer comes from anywhere.

1193,Emotion,NightPoemsPeopleAtNightPoembyDeniseLevertov,"A night that cuts between you and you
and you and you and you
and me : jostles us apart, a man elbowing
through a crowd.       & nbsp;  We won't
&nbs p;         ;     look for each other, either-
wander off, each alone, not looking
in the slow crowd. Among sideshows
& nbsp;     under movie signs,
&nb sp;       &nbs p;     pictures made of a million lights,
&n bsp;       &nb sp;     giants that move and again move
;              again, above a cloud of thick smells,
&n bsp;       &nb sp;     franks, roasted nutmeats-
Or going up to some apartment, yours
&nbs p;         ;     or yours, finding
someone sitting in the dark:
who is it really? So you switch the
light on to see: you know the name but
who is it ?
&n bsp;  But you won't see.
The fluorescent light flickers sullenly, a
pause. But you command. It grabs
each face and holds it up
by the hair for you, mask after mask.
&nbs p;         ;     You  &nb sp;and   you and I   repeat
&n bsp;       &nb sp;       &nbs p;gestures that make do when speech
&nb sp;       &nbs p;     has failed       & nbsp;  and talk

Translated by Robert Hass"
1195,Emotion,NightPoemsTheFirstNightOfFallAndFallingRainPoembyDelmoreSchwartz,"The common rain had come again
Slanting and colorless, pale and anonymous,
Fainting falling in the first evening
Of the first perception of the actual fall,
The long and late light had slowly gathered up
A sooty wood of clouded sky, dim and distant more and
more
Until, at dusk, the very sense of selfhood waned,
A weakening nothing halted, diminished or denied or set
aside,
Neither tea, nor, after an hour, whiskey,
Ice and then a pleasant glow, a burning,
And the first leaping wood fire
Since a cold night in May, too long ago to be more than
Merely a cold and vivid memory.
Staring, empty, and without thought
Beyond the rising mists of the emotion of causeless
sadness,
How suddenly all consciousness leaped in spontaneous
gladness,
Knowing without thinking how the falling rain (outside, all
over)
In slow sustained consistent vibration all over outside
Tapping window, streaking roof,
running down runnel and drain
Waking a sense, once more, of all that lived outside of us,
Beyond emotion, for beyond the swollen
distorted shadows and lights
Of the toy town and the vanity fair
of waking consciousness!"
1196,Emotion,CarPoemsCarCrashInReversePoembyElanniaLake,"Walls of white surround
Constant beeping is the only sound
Can’t move, I cry out in pain
Then they sedate me again
Lights are flashing
The ambulance is arriving
I can see the sympathetic looks of the crowd
My eyes close, and I pass out
I’m flying backward
A door bends inward
There’s a deafening sound in my ear
The car is impossible to steer
“Watch out! ” I scream
But my dad did not heed
My cry, he just drove ahead
To the crash that awaited
We were on the way
On the road for the day
Driving to the end of the path
With a weeks worth of luggage in tow
“Are you ready? Let’s go! ”
My dad’s face glowed
As we ran out the door
Hoping excitement was in store"
1197,Emotion,CarPoemsCarIsHerePoembyGajananMishra,"Car is here and I am in the car
Car is here and car is within me

Who can be termed self-sufficient
Inter-linking system is there
And I trust the car being my best friend."
1198,Emotion,CarPoemsLeaveMyCarAlonePoembyFrancisDuggan,"By stuffing newspaper up the exhaust of my car
Somebody I do not know have taken their fun too far
I do not have a known enemy and I'm new to this Town
Why is someone I do not know trying to drag me down?
My car it felt sick and I rang the R A C V
And what the mechanic discovered a huge surprise to me
A newspaper rolled up blocked the exhaust pipe rear
By some not too nice person it was pushed in there.
I am not without sin I will not cast the stone
But if you do not like the look of me leave my car alone
You do unto others what you'd like them do to you
Those words not by me but those words seem so true.
Against the person who did this I could not hold a grudge
And since I am not meant to be anyone's judge
Of that karma will surely take care
What goes around comes around that does seem fair.
Some non thinking person with low self esteem
Could only do something like this it would seem
And I would like to say to this person leave my old car be
You should not harm my car if you do not like me.
I am new to this Town here not many I know
And all I ask of anyone is a fair go
I am not without sin I will not cast the stone
And if you do not like the look of me leave my car alone."

I thought I had the right of way.
He says He’s suing after all;
Can you believe the Almighty gall.
“What happened to your spiel on Love? ”
“Not right now, Ms. Gilles Villeneuve!
I’ve been trying to get your whole attention;
I’m tired of your so-called good intention! ”
But I have things to do, a schedule to keep;
That Sunday check, it is not cheap!
Clients, family, even a yard,
And a shoddy attempt to be a bard.
But He tells me He’s feeling quite neglected;
Always the last one to be selected.
So I’m thinking “a little TLC”
And, just maybe, I could go scott-free.
I suggest coffee in a couple of days.
“I’m giving up caffeine! ”, so He says.
“So, what are my options? ” I almost yell.
“I thought you’d never ask to tell.
Take Me with you. I’ll ride along! ”
“A ride along? Now that's just wrong!
Will You pick the radio stations too? ”
“Is that too much to ask of you? ”
I threatened I would write about this…
“Go ahead! Won’t be your first hit-and-miss! ”
“Alright! Alright! Just come along,
But don’t say much and don’t sing that song! ”
So in order to prevent litigation,
I’m taking Him along…even on vacation!"

Money runs free like water from faucet
My car is broke again I must repair
Damages to plug, pump and oil pan

My mechanic made a lucrative plan
The elves inside your engine must be quelled
With regular maintenance and good gas

While I walked away frowning, one sad lass
Find a new car - a good resolution
One that runs is a better solution"

While my organs bleed
I guess you never know

And, when he was caught,
A wise man said he will pay twice as much for my car;
Hoping to repair my care and take care ofthe thief.
Then i said: ' I will give this care for free to the thief'!
The thief then answered: 'Oh! If i knew then that, this care will be mine as a gift, i will not have stolen it in the first place';
However, in this life, 'It is better to ask than, to steal'.
So, i got the value of my car being paid twice as much from the wise man;
And, he took the damaged car and the thief away."

drove with tears drowning my sight.
Didnt know where to turn
Drove into a ditch and felt a burn.
Lights blinding me in my eyes,
You could see the fears i tried to disguise.
I never thought i would make it out alive,
but God was there to help me strive.
So many thoughts going through my brain
I loved you once, but not again.
If i didnt get out of the car soon
I wouldnt live to see the shiny moon.
I was hospitalized for 2 weeks, in a coma for one of those weeks.
You never would have none, because you didnt ask,
While you forgot my name,
I forgot how much i cared about you.
But while in the hospital, i was thinking about dying,
I was thinking about you, and how you forgot everything you shared,
i got in a real car accident, but in the end, the only accident i got in, was letting you in to my heart and life."

A sharp flash that for a moment blinds the sun, then

It's shiny and black with alloy wheels and a spoiler on the back.
I go and get my new car today, boy I just can't wait
I said I'd be back at four today, I don't want to be late
It's got leather trim on the inside and clips for a roof rack.
I go and get my new car today, boy I'm all jumbly inside
I know it runs well because I took it for a drive
It's got electric headlamps and the interior is black.
I go and get my new car today, boy it's nearly time
only thirty minutes left to go before that car is mine
It's fast and tricky to steer but I'll soon get the knack.
I go and get my new car today, boy it's really great
I just can't wait to show it to my mate
It's just the best car ever on my toy racing track!"
1211,Emotion,CarPoemsLittleMrHansfordsCarPoembyPaulHansford,"A thousand children. How could I remember
all of them? I was the teacher; they were there
to learn. Those were our roles; that was the contract.
They would move up and I move on, for all of us
always a new beginning.
But now and then
one will return to haunt me, like the girl
whose secret friend drove a red plastic car.
I have it still. He was a tiny version
of myself.
The boy, his skin flaking
and cracked with eczema, trying to resist
the urge to scratch. How could he bear to wake
each day to face that life? Yet I was proud
he claimed me for his brother.
Another girl,
seventeen, crossing the Alps, moved beyond tears
by her first sight of mountains.
Do they remember?
Maybe they do. A young man in the street
I met by chance surprised me by recalling
how I read Winnie-the-Pooh when he was small
and did the animals in different voices.
So many children, so many years have gone,
but memories, like hope, can linger on."
1212,Emotion,CarPoemsTheMotorCarPoembyHenryLawson,"The motor car is sullen, like a thing that should not be;
The motor car is master of Smart Society.
’Twas born of sweated genius and collared by a clown;
’Twas planned by Retribution to ride its riders down.
And straight for Caesar’s Column,
It runs to Caesar’s Column,
Last section, Caesar’s Column
To ride its riders down!
The motor car is shame-struck, for greed and misery,
For mad and hopeless self-lust, and the sins that need not be.
The motor car is vicious, for its conscience makes it so,
It aye would smash the victims while it runs the riders low.
And straight for Caesar’s Column,
Its goal is Caesar’s Column,
It longs for Caesar’s Column
To lay its riders low.
The motor car is maddened like a horse that’s had a fright,
The shameful day behind it and the Coming of the Night!
It flees across the country and it flees back to the town
And straight for Caesar’s Column to run its riders down.
And straight for Caesar’s Column,
What ho! for Caesar’s Column!
Hurrah! for Caesar’s Column!
To seal its riders down.
The motor car is reckless like a gambler losing fast;
The motor car’s in terror of the Future—and the Past;
The motor car is worn out and has passed Sin’s boundary by,
And is bound for Caesar’s Column where to pile its riders high.
It’s bound for Caesar’s Column
And marked for Caesar’s Column,
And doomed for Caesar’s Column
To pile its riders high.
The motor car is brainless, and scornful of all tears,
Its dust is in our faces, its giggle in our ears,
Its harsh laugh is the last laugh of the last lost soul alone,
’Tis nearing Caesar’s Column to set self-damned in stone.
Change here for Caesar’s Column!
All out for Caesar’s Column!
Past Hope—and Caesar’s Column
To lodge self-damned in stone.
I don’t know how ’twill happen, or when ’twill come to pass,
But folk shall yet pass sanely by river, tree and grass;
By homesteads and farm wagons, they’ll ride each pleasant mile,
And back from Caesar’s Column where the world went mad awhile.
And back from Caesar’s Column
With lessons from the Column;
Grown sane at Caesar’s Column
To save the world awhile."

one sees the scattering of people
who do not have anything

at those other miseries of
children pushing carts to
hide their wares

for their hard earned money
of women disappointed for

1216,Emotion,CarPoemsKCarPoembyAlfHutchison,"To the memory of the Rhodesian Helicopter Pilots and
the 20mm cannon Gunner.Two men one helicopter;
known as K-car…..Killer-car.
A formidable force in the Rhodesian Bush War.
RHODESIAN K-CAR
‘Chopper’ pilot calmness,
Cannon gunner’s skill,
Two minds in perfect harmony,
Flew in now for the kill,
Ten comrades in arms,
Pinned down by enemy fire,
Ambushed and compromised,
Their backs now to the wire.
One pilot and one gunner,
Men who knew no fear,
S.O.S. came through to them,
Urgent… but so clear,
“K-car, Call sign Bravo, ”
“Contact, contact, contact”!
Pilot with nerves of steel,
And veraciously exact,
“We have you visual, four o’clock”,
Crackled in the pilot’s ear
He responded calmly “Roger
Call sign Bravo… illuminate a flare”
Flare lit up and in they flew,
Oblivious of the danger;
Twas deaths turn to roll the dice,
With life their coin of wager.
Two hands upon the cannon grips,
One finger on the trigger,
Gunner’s eye took a site,
Through peep site to the jigger;
Bullets ripped into the cockpit,
Of that killer-car machine,
Barely two year out of school,
K-car gunner… aged nineteen
Fire Force airborne pilot,
Turned cannon to the smoke,
Gunner pressed the trigger,
And the dragon now awoke;
Twenty millimeter cannon,
Boomed forth volcanic life
Spewing deadly rounds,
Of instant death and strife.
No place for enemy to hide,
From this matchless opponent;
Terrorists now in full flight,
Were gunned down in a moment.
The Kill-car hovered overhead,
Just six foot off the ground,
Two enemy lay screaming,
But from thirty dead…no sound.
Most men of war, whom I knew then,
Have turned now to the Lord,
They have turned into plow shears,
Their weapons and their sword.
Lord please teach us here in Africa,
Love for one another;
Take xenophobic intolerance from us,
Teach us to love our brother."
1217,Emotion,CarPoemsFastCarPoembyJamieDrake,"Like the car he drives,
He will pass you in the fast lane of life,
Like the blaring music from his car,
He loves life and a good joke,
Like the roaring engine of his car,
His temper will take off like a racer to the finish line,
With his fast car he ran straight through everyones heart,
When his engine went he went along with his fast car to heaven,
Going fast as he could down the road of eternal sleep,
While he lies in his eternal sleep never to wake his fast
car lies with him!

1218,Emotion,CarPoemsCarSunVisorsFunPoem65PoembyDavidHarris,"Every morning I have to drive towards the sun
just as the sun is about to rise.
You pull down the car sun visor,
but it is always too short
and the sun gets in your eyes.
You cannot see the road ahead,
just yellow blobs before your eyes.
You keep blinking until they fade away.
One day I wish car manufactures
would road test their cars in the morning sun.
They then might make
the car sun visors a little larger
to stop the sun getting in your eyes.

You say she’s not that dirty
And that you can’t afford to stop;
I say just think of the purpose
And let us wash her, bottom to top.
Let the volunteers of this good cause
Wash away the filth and slime.
Would you give a nice donation?
Would you make a little time?

One will never know how to drive.

So just enjoy the trip…relax!

1225,Emotion,CarPoemsClassicCarPoembyRayFeasey,"The leather upholstery and walnut dash
Nothing plastic looking cheap or brash
The shiny chrome and deep rug pile
Just sitting in it brings a smile
To clean for hours on weekend day
Then fill with petrol and drive away
To country place with airs and grace
This big old beauty has such pace
To see the many admiring stares
As they hurl past in their look-alike wares
Of modern age with designer fashion
All quiet the same, but no real passion
As hobbies go its not so cheap
Yet then again the joy you reap
Makes pure indulgence so worthwhile
As the whole 4 litre echoes such style
It’s old yet ageless none the less
With uneconomical thirst and zest
Then as you drive it all the while
Consider its journey mile on mile
Throughout its years and ownerships
What places has it been?
I wonder was it loved in early days
And by its then owner cleaned
Or did the staff just do the chore
And fetch it round to large front door
With owner sitting in the back
Just being chauffeured, prestige and that!

A rose, a rain or a river
They're natural thus beautiful
Uncorrupted, pristine, eternal
They're the life and so pure
To any mental ailing perfect cure.
The cashew nut, the cigar, the car
In the hands of a dictator they affiliate more.
Artificiality and sophistry
In revival of fortunes they cause only melancholy
At last beyond the influence
They 're confined, socio phobic, so artificial
All true pleasures, delight, happiness of life forever denied."

If it can ride you nearby or far
A car is a car
When it gets you in time to the bar
A car is a car
When you are addressed as Madam or Sir
But for some
A car is not just a car
It is a home
After a daylight roam
It is a home
After a nightly roam
Kind of like a homelessness
Reoccurring syndrome
Now give me any banger of a car
I'll give it hotly showers of a sauna
Play sweet tunes to it from a guitar
By the time you watch me stand by it
And pose with an exotic cigar
Waiting to take you out to dinar
You may even prefer it to a modernised jaguar
You see, to me
A car is just a car
Be it in a new silver shining coat
Or one decorated with tarnished scars
The simple reality
Is they all have similar
Passenger capacity
Whether be it a personalised 8 seater stretch limousine
Or a Ferrari with an exploding roaring engine
A car is a car
A vehicle of motion
A medium of transportation
Even when it shows signs of erosion
As long as it can move from junction to junction
I personally sanction
A car is just a car

1229,Emotion,CarPoemsCarWreckOnTheOldCoastRoadPoembyMichaelPhilips,"The most humorous
Car wreck I witnessed
Was on the old coast road.
I had returned to my cabana at dusk
After observing a hilarious shark attack
From the bluff above the beach.
The clouds were a smooch of pink.
I'd just sat down with my book,
Canterbury Tales, which
I was reading for the fourth time.
What an underrated book, I remember thinking.
Yes, I know it’s famous, but
You don’t usually find it on
Anyone’s top ten.
Not even top twenty.
You probably read it back in your
Treasure Island years.
If you read it again, I’m sure you’ll
Discover new insights swooshing off the page
Like little geysers.
Savoring the rich language that careens towards you with
Bright headlights while you’re crossing the Old Coast Road,
I’m sure you’ll move it up a few notches,
Maybe even into your twenty."
1230,Emotion,CarPoemsDrivingMyMothersOldRetiredCarPoembyTedSheridan,"The price of gasoline at the pump jumped so high;
therein robbing me of my play money, forcing me to eat
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, brown bagged
like an immature child enrolled in secondary school economics.
But being an older white male as I am, successful but
with only an average vertical jump; below that of four dollars a gallon.
I decided to turn in my gas guzzling and expensively leased SUV’s
to drive my aged mother’s old car that had been parked
as she can no longer benefit from the use of its
six cylinder and more efficient to operate, classic styling.
And when I say classic, I mean damn old.
This car is so old that in the year in which it was built
I not only had plenty of hair but my sperm count was still
much higher than the balance in my bank account.
The old car’s paint still shines like diamonds, the leather upholstery
maintains its new car smell; everything works and the engine runs well.
Driving around town with my brown bagged lunch on the
passenger’s seat, I can fully appreciate the appeal of quality
and old time luxury….and the fact that the gas gauge hardly moves…
I think back on a time when mother had two good knees,
two good hips, and two good eyes and she could drive
to the store on her own; where she could buy bread for under
a dollar a loaf, or milk for less than two dollars a gallon. Turkey
was ninety eight cents a pound and ham costs no more than Spam.
Those were the days when the dollar was worth a dollar
and a gallon of gas was cheap….before it made this crazy leap
above and beyond my ability to keep up with the Jones’s.
Reflecting on those good old days when my mom
was just mom and not some old woman who stares out the window
trying to remember where she left her keys….
I am reminded of the two lane streets with their blinking caution lights
as I now look at ten lanes of bumper to bumper, people cussing,
flipping you off at every red and slow changing traffic light
all fully equipped with a camera and a computer’s brain
that will take your picture and promptly mail it to your wife....
if that isn’t a peanut butter sandwich sitting next to you
in the front seat of your mother's old retired car….

1231,Emotion,CarPoemsAnIncidentInARailroadCarPoembyJamesRussellLowell,"He spoke of Burns: men rude and rough
Pressed round to hear the praise of one
Whose heart was made of manly, simple stuff,
As homespun as their own.
And, when he read, they forward leaned,
Drinking, with thirsty hearts and ears,
His brook-like songs whom glory never weaned
From humble smiles and tears.
Slowly there grew a tender awe,
Sun-like, o'er faces brown and hard,
As if in him who read they felt and saw
Some presence of the bard.
It was a sight for sin and wrong
And slavish tyranny to see,
A sight to make our faith more pure and strong
In high humanity.
I thought, these men will carry hence
Promptings their former life above,
And something of a finer reverence
For beauty, truth, and love.
God scatters love on every side
Freely among his children all,
And always hearts are lying open wide,
Wherein some grains may fall.
There is no wind but soweth seeds
Of a more true and open life,
Which burst, unlooked for, into high-souled deeds,
With wayside beauty rife.
We find within these souls of ours
Some wild germs of a higher birth,
Which in the poet's tropic heart bear flowers
Whose fragrance fills the earth.
Within the hearts of all men lie
These promises of wider bliss,
Which blossom into hopes that cannot die,
In sunny hours like this.
All that hath been majestical
In life or death, since time began,
Is native in the simple heart of all,
The angel heart of man.
And thus, among the untaught poor,
Great deeds and feelings find a home,
That cast in shadow all the golden lore
Of classic Greece and Rome.
O mighty brother-soul of man,
Where'er thou art, in low or high,
Thy skyey arches with exulting span
O'er-roof infinity!
All thoughts that mould the age begin
Deep down within the primitive soul,
And from the many slowly upward win
To one who grasps the whole:
In his wide brain the feeling deep
That struggled on the many's tongue
Swells to a tide of thought, whose surges leap
O'er the weak thrones of wrong.
All thought begins in feeling,-wide
In the great mass its base is hid,
And, narrowing up to thought, stands glorified,
A moveless pyramid.
Nor is he far astray, who deems
That every hope, which rises and grows broad
In the world's heart, by ordered impulse streams
From the great heart of God.
God wills, man hopes: in common souls
Hope is but vague and undefined,
Till from the poet's tongue the message rolls
A blessing to his kind.
Never did Poesy appear
So full of heaven to me, as when
I saw how it would pierce through pride and fear
To the lives of coarsest men.
It may be glorious to write
Thoughts that shall glad the two or three
High souls, like those far stars that come in sight
Once in a century;-
But better far it is to speak
One simple word, which now and then
Shall waken their free nature in the weak
And friendless sons of men;
To write some earnest verse or line,
Which, seeking not the praise of art,
Shall make a clearer faith and manhood shine
In the untutored heart.
He who doth this, in verse or prose,
May be forgotten in his day,
But surely shall be crowned at last with those
Who live and speak for aye."

Whose wife and daughter was in a family beauty

To indicate to this driver who was without acumen

And he was killed lying broken on the ground
His mates quickly ran to his aid
And the driver in his escape made
There was nothing left to be done
Except find the driver who had run
So they found and charged him for Gordon's death
And he was jailed but it did not diminish tragedy's breath
So again a family was left to carry on without a father
To compound the mess in a final grief to gather
Was the death of the wife in a crash which appalled
And we wonder how the daughter survived in justice called

No sooner than we knew it we were at the ticket office
And with oyster discounts in our hand and wristbands strapped on tight
It was not long before we took off upon our circular flight
Enclosed in glass we swept up to greyed out skies
The wind picked up and swayed us on our cable

But you proved to be the braver one you never moved a finger

This ain't no place to be if ya planned on being a star.
Let me tell you it's always cool
And the boss don't mind sometimes if ya act a fool.
Did a dentist named Dr. George Trusty could have done it?
Did dentist don the disco dance that put Brandy Fanning singin’ the blues?
Did the dentist know what has he done, his moves of body that do not quite fit,
His moves that would jeopardize his patients health as I heard today on the news?
Croce wouldn’t have done this, neither Rose Royce,
Kickin’ their songs about car washes,
But Trusty knew he had choice,
About doctoring the person in his chair,
About being serious, when you drill in to their mouth,
It is though he couldn’t care,
About his dentistry, may all his patient, beware.
He cracked a bit in nasal cavity,
He told her to sneeze,
He said something gone wrong,
She should blow out with ease.

Fast as anyone can

Now living in a car
Not much company
Such an epiphany
Freedom rang
Every time he sang
Sleeping in his car
His pillow his guitar
Song his creation
The road his destination
Dreams he has many
Doubts, no room for any
His heart so large
His soul in charge
Living in a car
Guided by a star
As if blind
He left so much behind
Stubbornly he wanted more
Wind beneath his wings to soar
Fast foods, fast times
Hard hills, hard climbs
Living in a car
Healing of a scar
Like a baby bird has flown
Alone into a zone unknown

And it will do him good

And the trees went forever upwards, haven’t

Steal the girl: get a good paying job,

All I could do was fall in love with her at the university.

I had a red lizard’s soul, and I sharpened my knife
On her wet stone heart,
But she was thoroughly petrified and I broke my
Gift on her and it didn‘t come back,
Like a dog would, or that careless, captured sea:
I wrote a worthy thesis and climbed some mountains
As an exegesis, and no one cared:
They moved in together and shared, and I lived in my
Hole in the earth, strange erotic dreams of bright teal
Tennis courts where my papers flew like late blooming  moths:
All over the place, restive and reasoning under her leaping tennis skirts.
The housewives loved me, molted the exoskeletons
Of their insouciant habits: Those auto grazers
Were giant and had so many legs, and ate themselves
With afforested tongue, and then laughed about it
Going to the tanning salon in their blazers:
She changed her name and forgot how I’d showed her
The tattoo south of my navel I got in Spain:
I forgot everything I learned about her,
My comrades forsaking me thinking I was dead,
A consumptive pickle-faced Mary Jane, I drank alone in my
Pine-needle bed- my toes peeking out of the covers to
Check the weather, and continued to worship the reindeers I could
No longer raise with my impotent necromancy
Stuffing my head."
1244,Emotion,CarPoemsCarPoembyAjaySrivastava,"Combination of attractive physique and comfort
a medium of connectivity and economic growth
a mixture of technical innovation& development
undoubtedly owner’s pride and little bit matter of envy.
Numerous  design, make, color and shine
Automatic system make it more attractive
Huge space inside give feeling of comfort
Forced to say I should have company of car.
Car is a time saving medicine, which is need of the hour
One city to another city, even one country to another country
Play important role in tourism of country
Of course car relate to economic growth.
From noise   to noise free car
From hand to automatic and remote control system
From heated and low speed to air-condition and high speed car
A result of technical know and development.
It’s owner always feel themselves special
Keep body and mind refresh as well as active
Still many don’t have car comfort
Car is a symbol & status of hi-fi society."
1245,Emotion,CarPoemsTheLadyOfTheMotorCarPoembyHenryLawson,"The Lady of the Motor-car she stareth straight ahead;
Her face is like the stone, my friend, her face is like the dead;
Her face is like the stone, my friend, because she is “well-bred”—
Because her heart is dead, my friend, as all her life was dead.
The Lady of the Motor-car she speaketh like a man,
Because her girlhood never was, nor womanhood began.
She says, “To the Aus-traliah, John!” and “Home” when she hath been.
And to the husband at her side she says, “Whhat doo you mean?”
The Lady of the Motor-car her very soul is dead,
Because she never helped herself nor had to work for bread;
The Lady of the Motor-car sits in her sitting-room,
Her stony face has never changed though all the land is gloom.
Her motor-car hath gone to hell—the hell that man hath made;
She sitteth in her sitting-room, and she is not afraid;
Nor fear of life or death, or worse, could change her well-bred mien;
She knits socks in a stony way, and says, “Whhat doo they mean?”
The lady in her carriage sits, with cushions turning green—
And once it was a mourning-coach, and once it held a queen.
Behind a coachman and a horse too old to go to war,
She driveth to her “four o’clocks” and to her sick and poor.
And when the enemy bombards and walls begin to fall,
The Lady of the Motor-car shall stand above you all;
Amongst the strong and silent brave, and those who pray or shriek,
She’ll nurse the wounded from the grave and pacify the weak.
And if the enemy prevails, with death on every side,
The Lady of the Car shall die as heroines have died,
But if the victory remains, she’ll be what she hath been,
And, sitting in her motor-car, shall say: “
Whhat doo you mean?

1246,Emotion,CarPoemsPetalumaPoliceCarTiresPoembyTonyAvilaSampson,"Parked at the curb,
The Petaluma Police could not observe,
The car their sarge had parked;
Not very far,
I found me that car,
And quickly thereto embarked;
While I approached the police cruiser,
I viewed the 'soon to be' accuser,
Yet continued on with my plan;
Two tires were popped,
As downward they dropped,
I fled in my sedan;
A laughing desire,
Brought a slash to each tire,
Done in full brightness of the day;
There I lurked,
Around the corner the cops worked,
And with them came my chance to play;
;
From each tire's quick blow,
Came the thrill hearing the air let flow,
And to the ground them rims did go;
By the knife's quick swing,
Came laughter from the hiss sound of air leaking,
While leaving the surprise of needing a tow;
No, 'Candid Camera' wasn't there,
To capture the officer's expression or glare,
When he viewed the car he left so careless;
Did he first move his car,
To discover that he couldn't drive far? ,
Did he hear the hiss or were they flat and airless?
Oh, what a dare,
For me to hear that gush sound of air,
Then escape, without being caught;
But with a short quiz,
The accuser said, 'I know who it is! ',
Well, my sedan, the police then sought;
My laughter was hard,
While I headed for my yard,
Though trouble was coming my way;
All patrol units looked about,
To search me out,
For the trouble that I now must pay,
While homeward I scoot,
Came a Sonoma County sheriff's deputy in pursuit,
Riding his cruiser close to my rear;
Bright red lights flashed on,
The fun was gone,
But still, I had no fear;
The joy it brought,
Was lost when caught,
And the laughter vanished away;
Very few people knew,
About the other police tires I blew,
And now just caught this day;
Stopped outside my home gate,
Came red lights  to wait,
The identification of who they caught;
Patrol units swarmed about,
It was me, they had no doubt,
They've captured who they sought;
Police car hysteria,
Was swarming the area,
Oh, it was boiling hot;
Like a beehive ready,
With a sting so steady,
A large police force quickly was brought;
'Put cuffs on them hands...'
As the police sergeant commands,
'...then take 'em in for lockup...'
With two flats on the cruiser,
The joke was a doozer,
As the number of times, years over, buildup;
I was brought before a judge,
But really...I had no grudge,
Gave forty dollars to the bondsman to bail;
As the jail door opened wide,
Quickly, I dashed outside,
Now released from the Sonoma County Jail;
I appeared in court again and again,
But a plea bargain made that end,
And no more jail time had I to pay;
Made unhappy, I was,
But that could be because,
'Pay for two tires and don't do it again', heard I, the court say;
Other police agencies know,
Twenty-eight of their tires went low,
The Cotati police headquarters suffered the worst;
Well, with two tires to buy,
My score remains still very high,
Considering the others I prior had burst;
If it ever happens again,
It won't be me, though I'll still grin.
I've retired, finally, from this crime;
The memory I still  bare,
The laughter, its thrill and dare;
And the story turned now into rhyme;"
1247,Emotion,CarPoemsCarTripPoembyBrookeRose,"Once apon a time, long, long ago
Daddy's car broke down when he bumped into a doe.
Mummy got her mobile, and called it to get towed
But when the fella came he said it was too big a load.
Brother bought an Ipod and listened all the while
Sister in the back put all her toys into a pile.
Daddy had a little fight with big man with a truck,
Mummy held a little tight to sisters toy pet duck.
Brother started singing when his favorite tune came on,
Daddy got a bruise when he said big man wieghed a tonne.
Mummy in the back looking for a big band-aid,
Sister saying help as she got on her knees and prayed.

Other than i was surprised when that dead doe ran away."
1248,Emotion,CarPoemsOurCarTheJamJarPoembysylviaspencer,"Once we had a car,
that was the colour of silver grey.
Now this little car, who we called our jam jar,
just loved a rainy day.
She would drive around for hour's,
with her wiper's turned on,
they would race back and forwards,
until the rain had compleatly gone.
Her brakes were truely majic,
when pulled up at a halt.
Then a funny sort of sound would come,
as if she was saying' that ain't my fault!
This lovely little car of our's,
was just a little dream,
driving down the highway,
with her headlights on full beam.
Everytime it rained, she always looked bright,
even if we were driving,
all through the night.
The crome on her bumper,
shone like stars in the sky.
Then everything seemed to change,
when the weather turned dry.
The jam jar, would not start,
because her battery woulden't charge,
so jump leads were needed,
with a push, shuve and a barge.
If we went on our holidays,
and the weather was fine,
we always prayed for rain,
so we would reach there on time.
In seventy six, there came a heatwave,
and the weather was boiling hot.
The same thing happened to our jam jar,
then she gave her last breath,
and died there on the spot."
1249,Emotion,CarPoemsIHaveBoughtThisCarPoembyGajananMishra,"I have bought this car
By my own money
I am driving my own car
Under the control of material nature.
My wife my son my daughter
All are here helping me
In this life-driving, my dear
Let me be a free driver.
O my dear, You have given me the licence
To drive this car here and there
You have given me the chance
To fight with water and fire.
I know it is I who is responsible for the accident if any
I know my car my licence are subject to seize for reckless drive."
1250,Emotion,CarPoemsBuyingACarPoembyDianeHine,"I wanted a car when I wearied of walking.
With savings in hand, I left home to peruse.
The dealer was helpful, bright-eyed and fast-talking.
He offered two models from which I could choose.
The first looked immaculate, surfaces gleaming,
compared to the other, defaced by a scratch.
""The price is the same"", said the car dealer, beaming.
I deemed him unscheming, so asked ""What's the catch""?
He mumbled and hemmed as he opened each bonnet.
I missed all his words, for the squeak of the hood.
While first engine, seamless, had no mark upon it,
the other was patchwork of iron and wood.
The first car, he promised, would cause me no worry,
the makers long trusted with local renown.
He offered a test drive, said ""No need to hurry,
as long as you stay within limits of town"".
I took up the offer and signed on a paper.
The engine was purring and swift to respond.
But being a person who's fond of a caper,
I passed the town's limits and ventured beyond.
From then on the engine desisted from purring.
It coughed a smoke hairball and came to a halt.
The dealer arrived with a tow-truck, incurring
a fee charged to me since he judged it my fault.
He frowned and seemed puzzled, said ""If you must ramble,
the other car's needed for leaving our town.
I have to inform, you'd be taking a gamble.
It's not a smooth ride and it sometimes breaks down"".
I nodded and said ""I accept the conditions"",
then paid him in dollars and signed in the space.
And that was beginning of my expeditions
which took me here, there and all over the place.
The dealer told true, there are frequently glitches
with rattles and rumbles and things that go ping.
Mechanics repair it with staples and stitches,
or bright shiny gadgets or widgets or string.
I sometimes pass towns where the locals are driving
their own perfect models which never give strife.
Though bound to their towns, they appear to be thriving,
but this car will do, for a wandering life."
1251,Emotion,CarPoemsInTheSmokingCarPoembyRichardWilbur,"The eyelids meet. He'll catch a little nap.
The grizzled, crew-cut head drops to his chest.
It shakes above the briefcase on his lap.
Close voices breathe, ""Poor sweet, he did his best.""
""Poor sweet, poor sweet,"" the bird-hushed glades repeat,
Through which in quiet pomp his litter goes,
Carried by native girls with naked feet.
A sighing stream concurs in his repose.
Could he but think, he might recall to mind
The righteous mutiny or sudden gale
That beached him here; the dear ones left behind . . .
So near the ending, he forgets the tale.
Were he to lift his eyelids now, he might
Behold his maiden porters, brown and bare.
But even here he has no appetite.
It is enough to know that they are there.
Enough that now a honeyed music swells,
The gentle, mossed declivities begin,
And the whole air is full of flower-smells.
Failure, the longed-for valley, takes him in."
1252,Emotion,CarPoemsMyCarOfInspirationPoembyGeethaJayakumar,"Decided are my ways;
Altered are my days,
for I know where to move;
For I know the way to reach.
My destination is too far to being seen.
With a map set in my mind,
With a slow speed I will start,
the engine of my car.
Well I am the lone driver,
I am the lone traveller;
Gear is set.
Mind is set right.
Mirror is well set up,
So that I get the three dimensional view.
Slowly I accelerated the speed,
Now I know the ABC of life,
I know when to apply break,
I know when to accelerate the speed
I know when to use clutch.
Here I am set to go!
I have to keep on moving,
On the same speed,
With my eyes and ears open,
My mind should work in coordination with,
My eyes, ears and hands.
My wonder car started,
Moving ahead all way.
It will wait for none,
Till my brain is in gear.
I will not turn back.
In between I will put a break
To give a pause to my brain too.
My wonder car started
Its moving towards a new way.
Through the path that seemed to be rough and smooth.
Today, Nothing matters me much.
I have to move ahead through unknown path.
With a steering controlled by my hand and mind.
I will move ahead with thrill and reach my destination.

though it scare the hell out of us
Bumping up and down in the car
Stopping and going so suddenly
But still fun we had though
you can hear swearing everywhere
Everyone swearing i would not
get in the car again if there a next time
Lucky it was late late in the night

most lucky no police car  (hehehe)

1254,Emotion,CarPoemsCarFestivalPoembyDEEPAKKUMARPATTANAYAK,"June-July with its divine hues comes every year;
Bringing car festival of its kind very rare,
Heaven of earth as people call it is Puri Dham,
Becomes lively, vibrant and colourful,
When Gods from heaven up above
Descend here to share joys with devotees so rare.
Three deities in three colourful and huge wooden Chariots;
Thousands of people pulling them to a distance of three furlongs,
From Srimandira to Gundicha Temple under scorching sun,
Ecstatic are devotees beating sun and pulling chariots,
And screaming Oh Lord, stay with us, don't go away,
Let thy presence be always felt by us and not shine away,
And the Chariots roll down the grand road to destination not far away.
Millions of pilgrims throng the grand road;
To have darshan (Holy view)   of our beloved lords,
Passing by in Chariots, touching our body, mind and soul,
Cleansing thousand births' sins just on viewing our Lords,
Devotees beating drums, dancing, singing in praise of Gods,
And the air filled with divine ecstasies, loves and sounds of choirs,
Seemingly mesmerizing Gods in heaven up above,
To descend on hallowed grand road to mingle with devotees-behold.
Embrace all, enthral all, love all and mingle with all;
Irrespective of castes, creeds and religions,
Our lords are symbolic of Brahma, Bishnu and Maheswara,
Stand for Sanatana Dharma as universal God or religion,
They are Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra and Goddess Subhadra,
Adoring the Chariots over the grand road pulled toward destination,
And as life's chariot o'er Time's grand road is drawn,
Our Lord Jagannath knows the way and destination,
While the rumbling wheels go on."

With wheels. And me smiling,
Wearing my new sunglasses
Driving you crazy sitting on
Your rubber wobbly
Roof.
I drink another diet coke
And throw it in the back
With the other 500 cans
And the papers, and the gum
Stuck to the carpet like it’s
Got teeth.
Burrito bell smell attacks!
68 empty mickie D bags.
You can slide your steel
Door to let out the animals
And insects that call you
Home.
Sitting on a trash receptacle
I chuckle as people stare
At us scraping up the road,
Chewing concrete like cupcakes,
Our sparks screaming bloody
Murder.
I throw a half a Whopper
Into the back seat as we
Pull up to the drive (threw)
And you, monster dumpster,
Breathing heavy @ doesn’t fit.
Too rusty.

At its steady pace

And the rain was pouring so strange

I'd trade it in for a newer model.
For I think I need a towbar,
From the dents I've endured in battle.
My paint job is a little dull,
My headlights are out of focus.
I'm no longer very mobile,
My body's an old aged carcass.
My bodywork's full of varicose scratches,
I'm in need of cosmetic work.
My brakes make nasty screeches,
That stops me with a jerk.
My traction is not as graceful,
I slip and slide and skid.
I have to drive quite careful,
Never mind what weather I'm in.
It takes me hours to reach a speed,
My fuel rate burns inefficiently.
I need some TLC to succeed,
And nice accessories that are costly.
Every time I sneeze or cough,
My radiator leaks.
My exhaust backfires a lot,
And my tires now tend to squeak.
Yes, if my body was a car,
I'd trade it in for sure.
I think I'd choose a jaguar,
With a body all slick and grandeur!"

Which is Kanpuu who is it to know and blows time over everything;
As for the body left by they whom know to wander aimlessly for there transgressions in my mind, unorthodox never to walk the road.
Of the sand which you can stoop down to gather up through open hands, independently through the pine forest.
My road was not of such to rise to the road which crosses over the mountain of which becomes bald.
Forever is ever when that aluminum of the mouth, there is no I,
that person looking at it that it rises to my your the one.
When never to open the door to the knock, spearing the throat there is no pointed razor which eats off the pasture.

The warning is.

Even the rich appear to go for it;
Five-geared, with mileage almost twenty-two;
And ample space for luggage; five can sit;
It is the car that every heart can woo!
It stands so splendidly in front of house,
And glows with beauty- all appreciate;
It is the car that’s loved by any spouse;
Perhaps, its cost can’t much depreciate!
With Alto, any distance, you can go;
No wonder ’tis India’s foremost car, oh!"

Fast Car
You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Anyplace is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
But me myself I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living
You see my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
But is it fast enough so we can fly away
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way
I remember we were driving driving in your car
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
And I had feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a big house and live in the suburbs
You got a fast car
And I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving
You got a fast car
But is it fast enough so you can fly away
You gotta make a decision
You leave tonight or live and die this way

1266,Emotion,CarPoemsCarWashersFunPoem34PoembyDavidHarris,"You pull into a car park
and they spring out of nowhere.
“Do you want your car washed
while you’re doing your shopping?
We do not charge a lot.”
My answer is no.
“Sorry mate but my car is under scientific study.
I am an insect- ornithologist.
I study bird droppings and insect splatters.
I get out every night with my tweezers,
take the remaining bits off,
and put them in a specimen jar.
I am also going in for
the dirtiest car of the year award.
I have won it three times already.
So you see my car does not need a wash thank you.”
They look at me somewhat strangely
before they go on their merry way.
Therefore, the next time you pull into a car park
and someone wants to wash your car.
Just tell them you are an insect-ornithologist
engaged in a scientific study.
They will never understand what you mean.
They might think you are somewhat strange,
but you will save yourself a packet.
Now that ain’t strange, that is wise.

But I'm pretty good at driven my rocket race car's
A go getter maybe I'm not
I'm not known for doin' a lot
But I do my best work out on the track
I'm pretty good at driven my race car
So give me one more lap
That's what I'm here for
I'm built for having a ball
I love the dirt race track's
I love my rocket race car
I like it 25 laps or more
I was born for driven rocket race car's
I'm not made for pavin long roads
I aint cut out to climb high line poles
But I'm pretty good at driven my rocket race car
pretty good at driven dirt race car's"
1269,Emotion,CarPoemsPrincessNeedsANewCarPoembyMaryNagy,"Princess just wants a new car.
I have told her that hers will go far.
''Oh, it's really not cool
driving this crap to school.''
''Do I need that emotional scar? ''
''The kids will all laugh at the rust.
When we race, I'll be left in the dust!
I will save up some cash
then we'll make a mad dash
to the car dealer surely you trust''.
''He will make us a wonderful deal
and I'm sure you will know how I feel.
I will love you so much,
My siblings... I won't touch.
Just get me behind a new wheel! ''

She'll be happy for only awhile.
There will always be better

1270,Emotion,CarPoemsLastNightIDroveACarPoembyGregoryCorso,"Last night I drove a car

not owning a car

people I loved

I stopped at Hedgeville
and slept in the back seat
...excited about my new life."
1271,Emotion,CarPoemsTheLayOfTheMotorCarPoembyBanjoPaterson,"We're away! and the wind whistles shrewd
In our whiskers and teeth;
And the granite-like grey of the road
Seems to slide underneath.
As an eagle might sweep through the sky,
So we sweep through the land;
And the pallid pedestrians fly
When they hear us at hand.
We outpace, we outlast, we outstrip!
Not the fast-fleeing hare,
Nor the racehorses under the whip,
Nor the birds of the air
Can compete with our swiftness sublime,
Our ease and our grace.
We annihilate chickens and time
And policemen and space.
Do you mind that fat grocer who crossed?
How he dropped down to pray
In the road when he saw he was lost;
How he melted away
Underneath, and there rang through the fog
His earsplitting squeal
As he went -- Is that he or a dog,
That stuff on the wheel?"
1272,Emotion,CarPoemsWhosDrivingThisCarPoembyPattiMasterman,"The window's blurry,
The odometer's broke,
​The tires are bare;
Who's driving this car?
The seats are saggy
From long time use,
The rear-view's broken;
Who's driving this car?
It knocks down the road
Toward the next bone yard,
And it can't get far;
Who's driving this car?
Once it was new,
Best thing on the road,
But now it's just old;
So who's driving this car?
I'M driving this thing,
And this car is ME,
And it's all worn out,
But I make it work.
If I didn't have it,
I'd be a-foot,
A fool on the pavement;
In fact, just stuck.
So I praise this car
And it's wobbly ride-
And I'm gosh darn grateful
That I'm still inside."

I am driving the car
Ask not its name and number

See my car,

Controlling the steering wheel
I am driving the car,
Giving due respect to
Accelerator and brake,
I know here in this car
There is the truth called engine,
Passion and action are there
In fuel and I know all knowledge
And everything is there in tool box
Provided by the company itself.
See my car
I am going with my car
To the service center
As it is not running well
As it met an accident
Though no fault of mine,
All of a sudden it met an accident
With the rain and the sun."

Hang on a strap with me here
At seven o’clock in the morning
On a Halsted street car.

And draw these faces.
Try with your pencils for these crooked faces,
That pig-sticker in one corner—his mouth—
That overall factory girl—her loose cheeks.
Find for your pencils
A way to mark your memory
Of tired empty faces.
After their night’s sleep,
In the moist dawn
And cool daybreak,
Faces
Tired of wishes,
Empty of dreams."

1277,Emotion,CarPoemsBoxCarHarryPoembyLonnieHicks,"The railroad dick looked straight at him, eyes unwavering, beady-eyed, menacing, and Harry counted his change to see if there was enough for a bribe; searched his thoughts for an escape route, but he was not as young as he used to be and the dick was young, legs like a deer.
He tussled Barney’s hair and said:
“Go there in that thar car and wait for me, got to dump the dick. Wait for my whistle.”
Barney looked up him hesitantly and Harry stammered hoarsely
“Go! ”
Barney scrambled on all fours the way Harry had taught him and quickly disappeared under cover of the dark Chicago night.
Always, the dick against the Bos, the rich against the poor was Harry’s thought, been that way since her was born, the wanders, the lose, the lose people on the road trying to find an odd job and a meal, against the railroad fat cats trying to exterminate the railroad people, who what was just trying to get by.
Harry held his breath and told himself to concentrate and finally turned back to the dick and showed himself, full on so as the dick could get a good look at him. The dick wide-eyed and incredulous stared hard at Harry surprised by the brazenness of the tramp and stood stock still for a moment, prey in the eyes of the predator.
Harry swayed a little left and then a little right like a running back taunting the linebacker, which way boy, am I going to bolt, which way is the question. Harry feinted a dash to the right and the dick crouched right ready for the chase, Harry smiled and then feinted to the left, testing the dick’s reflexes. The dick danced to the left enjoying the thrilling moment before the chase.
Harry guessed Barney had had time to secure himself in the car and then dashed straight toward the dick, who was thoroughly surprised and steeled himself for what he thought would be a crash between the two men. But Harry at the last minute slanted right allowing the dick to remain close behind but not enough to lay hand on him.
He headed for track 13 for the Great Northern line car.
The dick was breathing behind him; Harry could hear his labored breaths, close enough but not close enough to grab, what was what Harry wanted.
He hit the Northern line yard and saw number 13 looming. The dick was laughing behind him yelping with the sheer joy of it all, feeling he had Harry cornered because the Northern lot was a closed in one, a big wall in the back, a closed station and of course cars, most closed.
But Harry was aiming toward 13 and left up into the car and waited for the dick to catch up and see him. Harry looked down at the man’s heaving chest smiling his best Harry smile.

1278,Emotion,CarPoemsUsedCarSalesPeoplePoembyFrancisDuggan,"With the gift of the gab they would talk their way out of hell
These used car sales people they know how to sell
On their selling ability their jobs are at stake
The more cars they do sell the more commission they do make
On any deals they clinch they have never lost
And your trust on such people can come at a cost
The more cars they sell the more money they get paid
A hard job to succeed in the used car trade,
Shy and sensitive used car sales people one might say are rare
To sell one a car no effort they do spare
They have to sell cars or their boss them will fire
And other used car yard owners as car sales people them will not hire
The more cars they sell the greater is their pay
So to sell you a car they try every which way."

'Well, once again, this deal is,

I'm in a mood to help you out,

that you will send me all your friends,

the truth is, that you may be, so I notice
a bit embarrassed with that old jalopy.'
'So what is the exact and final figure,
counting the trade of Cedric here,
and all the costs on road and for the Kaiser,
insurance which you kindly offered,
in other words, how much will be enough? '
'Now that's more like it, the thinking man,
you know, so many of my customers are,
to put it mildly, so ignorant, don't get me wrong,
I like them all, but it is always such a pleasure
to deal with someone who can think like you.
So, I suggest we get the papers done right now,
I'll call your banker with the final figures then,
and you go home and celebrate the deal,
no need to worry, I will handle it from here.'"

I am The Great White Way of the city:

With young faces tired of the cows and barns,
Eager in their eyes as the dawn to find my mysteries,
Slender supple girls with shapely legs,
Lure in the arch of their little shoulders
And wisdom from the prairies to cry only softly at
the ashes of my mysteries.""

upon the painted faces of women on
North Clark Street, Chicago
Roses,
Red roses,
Crushed
In the rain and wind

Beaten by the fists of
Men using them.
O little roses
And broken leaves
And petal wisps:
You that so flung your crimson
To the sun
Only yesterday.

Glorious summer glistening with light
Reminiscent of days in the blue Ford Anglia
When we travelled the road ~ love at its height.
Again I can see the whole picture
Of the hills and heather so sweet,
The scenery resembling an island of dreams
As our blue Ford Anglia made happiness complete.
Secretly, I offer a silent prayer
Those bygone days still live in my heart.
Just we two, in that little car of blue
Admiring the magnificence of God's works of art."

Sharp as golden sands,
A bell is clanging, people sway
Hanging by their hands.
Supple hands, or gnarled and stiff,
Snatch and catch and grope;
That face is yellow-pale, as if
The fellow swung from rope.
Dull like pebbles, sharp like knives,
Glances strike and glare,
Fingers tangle, Bluebeard's wives
Dangle by the hair.
Orchard of the strangest fruits
Hanging from the skies;
Brothers, yet insensate brutes
Who fear each other's eyes.
One man stands as free men stand,
As if his soul might be
Brave, unbroken; see his hand
Nailed to an oaken tree."

that fits five quite comfortably,

when shopping think I drive a lorry.
The thing is that they think
it will take them as well,
would you believe.
I do not know where they got the notion
that if you push the back seat down
you can carry triple the amount.
In a minute if they keep going
I will be driving through the sunroof
as there will not be any room
for me in my little red car.

On to Narrandera and West Wyalong and many smaller country town,
To Forbes and Parkes and on through Dubbo, Gilgandra and Coonabarabran
Miles and miles of weary travel through the world of outback man.
On to Narribri and then to Moree on the north bound Newell highway
Through New South Wales the country's first State on a sunny April day
And we cross the Queensland border just after the sun go down
And we spend our first night in the Sunshine State in Goondiwindi Town.
Lettered signboards along the highway 'stop and rest for to survive'
From Victoria to South Queensland it's a long and tiring drive
For to see all of Australia it might take a century
It's a vast and open country and a lot of land to see.
Miles and miles of sunburnt country here and there a patch of green
Flocks of sheep and herds of cattle in the brownest land I've seen,
Kangaroos victims of traffic ravens pecking at their eyes
Here and there along the highway left as fodder for the flies.
This vast land of wondrous beauty is too big for man to tame
It's a wild and rugged country for want of a better name
Just a small part of Australia but the journey seems quite far
If you travel from Victoria to south Queensland in a car.
From the wooded hills of Sherbrooke to Echuca's border Town
On through New South Wales and northwards though a country wild and brown
On beyond South Queensland border to rest after tiring day
Just a small part of Australia but it seems a long, long way."

Sanathana Sarathi (eternal charioteer,

was charioteer for Arjuna.)
One day a car caravan as often happened
was following Baba's car to a destination.
One after another, parts fell off of Kasturi's
car. When they arrived Kasturi took the car
to a mechanic who said it was physically
impossible for the car to have arrived.
Kasturi went to Baba and asked 'Was it

'The car, the car is a great devotee.'"

Headliner hanging
Tailpipe dragging
Beauty Queen of broken dreams
Had the world on string

Growing up pretty
Doesn’t create pity
It creates a single road
No one informed you
That a good life is earned
Not owed
Needed to be a Mrs
Afraid to be missed
You gave your only quality
Didn’t think you had a mind to share
But your pretty self alone
Couldn’t keep “him” there.
Made babies born with a Job
Mixing “him” and Pretty you
Instead of fulfilling your purpose
The babies became discarded trash too.

Cleaning up other peoples messes
Cant clean up your own

Get in your shitty car
Hoping it will start
Hoping you still have a home"

A car that’s found a place in hearts;
A car that easily too starts!

And modern car for all of us!

The car for young, old, me and you;
The car that could be number one,
The Tata Nano is great fun!

The Color of the Grave is Green—
The Outer Grave—I mean—
You would not know it from the Field—
Except it own a Stone—
To help the fond—to find it—
Too infinite asleep
To stop and tell them where it is—
But just a Daisy—deep—
The Color of the Grave is white—
The outer Grave—I mean—
You would not know it from the Drifts—
In Winter—till the Sun—
Has furrowed out the Aisles—
Then—higher than the Land
The little Dwelling Houses rise
Where each—has left a friend—
The Color of the Grave within—
The Duplicate—I mean—
Not all the Snows could make it white—
Not all the Summers—Green—
You've seen the Color—maybe—
Upon a Bonnet bound—
When that you met it with before—
The Ferret—cannot find—"

Skirted round with houses small,
All the boys and girls are seen,
Playing there with hoop and ball.
Now they frolic hand in hand,
Making many a merry chain;
Then they form a warlike band,
Marching o'er the level plain.
Now ascends the worsted ball,
High it rises in the air,
Or against the cottage wall,
Up and down it bounces there.
Then the hoop, with even pace,
Runs before the merry throngs;
Joy is seen in every face,
Joy is heard in cheerful songs.
Rich array, and mansions proud,
Gilded toys, and costly fare,
Would not make the little crowd
Half so happy as they are.
Then, contented with my state,
Where true pleasure may be seen,
Let me envy not the great,
On a cheerful village green."

as shimmering across the moon
when untouched even by the rain
the mute voices when besotted

With every smile she fakes

There is no other way out
Lately its only suicide
Thats all she thinks about
Covered up in bruises
From the parents who should love
The ones who should hold her
But never show a gentle touch
Alone as far as she can tell
She only has her best friend
Though she thinks no one loves her
And is determined this is the end
She doesn't know I love her
She doesn't know how much I care
Now she never will
For she is hanging there
I wish I could've saved her
Before her days were through

And I gave the only love she knew
Now she lies so lifeless
So beautiful through my tear-stung eyes
She was everything to me
And now she is a Green-Eyed Suicide"

In the moss along the creek
Where the icy waters flow
Around the roots

And like a running river, winds along

Of birds at noon-day, and no soft throats yield
Their music to the moon. The place is sealed,
An unclaimed sovereignty of voiceless song,
And all the unravished silences belong
To some sweet singer lost or unrevealed.
So is my soul become a silent place.
Oh, may I wake from this uneasy night
To find a voice of music manifold.
Let it be shape of sorrow with wan face,
Or Love that swoons on sleep, or else delight
That is as wide-eyed as a marigold."

And make happy the skies;
The merry bells ring
To welcome the spring;
The skylark and thrush,
The birds of the bush,
Sing louder around
To the bell's cheerful sound,
While our sports shall be seen
On the Echoing Green.
Old John with white hair,
Does laugh away care,
Sitting under the oak,
Among the old folk.
They laugh at our play,
And soon they all say:
'Such, such were the joys
When we all, girls and boys,
In our youth time were seen
On the Echoing Green.'
Till the little ones, weary,
No more can be merry;
The sun does descend,
And our sports have an end.
Round the laps of their mothers
Many sisters and brother,
Like birds in their nest,
Are ready for rest,
And sport no more seen
On the darkening Green.

Or proceeded to battle.                                            10
Lo! the camps of the tents of green,
Which the days of peace keep filling, and the days of war keep
filling,
With a mystic army, (is it too order'd forward? is it too only
halting awhile,
Till night and sleep pass over?)
Now in those camps of green--in their tents dotting the world;
In the parents, children, husbands, wives, in them--in the old and
young,
Sleeping under the sunlight, sleeping under the moonlight, content
and silent there at last,
Behold the mighty bivouac-field, and waiting-camp of all,
Of corps and generals all, and the President over the corps and
generals all,
And of each of us, O soldiers, and of each and all in the ranks we
fought,                                                      20
(There without hatred we shall all meet.)
For presently, O soldiers, we too camp in our place in the bivouac-
camps of green;
But we need not provide for outposts, nor word for the countersign,
Nor drummer to beat the morning drum."

1310,Emotion,GreenPoemsSadGreenEyesPoembyLindaOri,"You look at me with sad green eyes,
I'm overcome with feeling-
Such deep emotion they disguise,
Yet send my senses reeling; They speak to me of loneliness
And feelings unexpressed,
Of hopes and dreams unrealized
And love gone uncaressed; They cry to me of urgency
To experience it all-
But here you are in limbo
With your back against the wall; I wish I had the answers
To the questions they impose-
I'm drowning in those sad green eyes
And the sorrow only grows; If I had one magic wish,
You know what it would be?
To see instead of sad green eyes
Green eyes that smile for me."
1311,Emotion,GreenPoemsGreenLeavesAndSerePoembyMathildeBlind,"Three tall poplars beside the pool
Shiver and moan in the gusty blast,
The carded clouds are blown like wool,
And the yellowing leaves fly thick and fast.
The leaves, now driven before the blast,
Now flung by fits on the curdling pool,
Are tossed heaven-high and dropped at last
As if at the whim of a jabbering fool.
O leaves, once rustling green and cool!
Two met here where one moans aghast
With wild heart heaving towards the past:
Three tall poplars beside the pool."
1312,Emotion,GreenPoemsTheGardenerLxxxivOverTheGreenPoembyRabindranathTagore,"Over the green and yellow rice-fields
sweep the shadows of the autumn
clouds followed by the swift-chasing
sun.
The bees forget to sip their honey;
drunken with light they foolishly hover
and hum.
The ducks in the islands of the river
clamour in joy for mere nothing.
Let none go back home, brothers,
this morning, let none go to work.
Let us take the blue sky by storm
and plunder space as we run.
Laughter floats in the air like foam
on the flood.
Brothers, let us squander our
morning in futile songs."
1313,Emotion,GreenPoemsGreenLifePoembyrachelabraham,"Now sitting outside,
The refreshing wind blows
Revealing the life of nature.
The grass may be yellow,
But underneath is a layer
Just waiting to grow.
The birds may be singing,
Dandelions may be glowing,
But will it last?
The birds may not be singing
The tunes that we hear,
It may be wails that they speak.
Begging for an answer,
In what they’ve done wrong.
Dandelions look like the sun,
But for them, they could be opening up
To whatever they have left.
Not wanting to be cut,
So when their second life approaches,
They will stay vibrate than grey
All because mankind got natures law wrong.
As I sit hear,
I listen to all that has been taught.
The trees are all dying,
The pond is overflowing,
From the dump we’ve been throwing
Between the beautiful silence
I feel the wind blow through my hair.
Then all you see is a plane from the city.
Polluting the air,
Just to get people somewhere.
Air is a limited thing,
No way can you buy it.
Replacing what once was,
Than keeping what’s there.
Experimenting a leaf, finding a bug
Scream, but only one thing,
The bug isn’t bigger than me.
Wanting so bad to kill it,
But killing that bug,
Is another phrase for extinction.
Life is a beautiful thing, but living in a
Dump is not.
Life may be short, some people may not
Care; saying no problem, we can get more
With the money we’ve been making.
Now, who in mankind, has the right mind,
To waste his money caring,
When he could be doubling it.
Remember one thing when life comes to an end,
What’s going to be left for the money of mankind?
The world currently may be black,
But let’s turn it green."
1314,Emotion,GreenPoemsGreenTheColorgreenThingsPoembyBriEdwards,"My favorite colors are green and brown.
Green-leafed trees polka-dot our town.
Green’s the color of farm pond scum,
and green’s the color of green tea gum.
Copper turns green when it’s weathered.
Some Amazon parrots are green-feathered.
Green is the color Army privates wear,
and green’s what the young clerk dyed his hair.
The city of Oz was oh so green!
Green is the color of a string bean.
If you’re nauseous you’re “green around the gills”,
and I’d be “green with envy” if you had no bills.
Green beer is drunk on St. Patrick’s Day.
Green is the color of newly mowed hay.
A wilted green salad looks so sad,
but a green stick fracture is “not so bad”.
Greenbacks are U.S. paper money.
From green clover bees make clover honey.
A green traffic light tells me to go,
and a green banana ain’t ripe you know.
A green-winged teal is a small duck,
and a green four-leafed clover may bring you luck.
I’ve heard of “green thumb” but not “green nose”.
I wonder if green is the color of gangrened toes."

I visited to my far relatives who were living there.
Some are in California and the rest in Massachusetts.
They showed me the hospitality but in doubts.
I feel that they might think I'll be a burden for them.
Never mind I said good bye
And searched for my scattered unseen friends.
I am totally tired and frustrated.
I heard the statue of Liberty is whispering something.
'Why don't you visit our ancestors? '
I left for Red indian Reservoirs
And they guided me to Geronimo's tomb and some Apaches.
We talked each other many things like old familiar friends
And when I woke up I found a red feather on my pillow.
Sing Song my beloved wife brought me the bed tea."

While the rain is on the roof."

Served with a smile

1318,Emotion,GreenPoemsGreenGreenAndGreenPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"I want a holiday with a scene
Of green, green and green
A summer of green trees
A landscape of green grass
A view full of green vegetables
The colour green
Is a beauty that must be seen!
From a moving vehicles screen
And while we hold onto those machines
That deprives us of the colour green
Remember they provide us vaccines
As well as help the air to be clean
So for green, green and green
I will travel continents across and in-between
And also to any place that I have never been
I will make it routine
Just to see green, green and green

The birds sang sweet in the middle of the day;
I dreamed fast of mirth and play:
In youth is pleasure, in youth is pleasure.
Methought I walked still to and fro,
And from her company I could not go;
But when I wak'd it was not so:
In youth is pleasure, in youth is pleasure.
Therefore my heart is surely pight
Of her alone to have a sight,
Which is my joy and heart's delight:
In youth is pleasure, in youth is pleasure."
1321,Emotion,GreenPoemsGreenChilePoembyJimmySantiagoBaca,"I prefer red chile over my eggs
and potatoes for breakfast.
Red chile ristras decorate my door,
dry on my roof, and hang from eaves.
They lend open-air vegetable stands
historical grandeur, and gently swing
with an air of festive welcome.
I can hear them talking in the wind,
haggard, yellowing, crisp, rasping
tongues of old men, licking the breeze.
But grandmother loves green chile.
When I visit her,
she holds the green chile pepper
in her wrinkled hands.
Ah, voluptuous, masculine,
an air of authority and youth simmers
from its swan-neck stem, tapering to a flowery collar,
fermenting resinous spice.
A well-dressed gentleman at the door
my grandmother takes sensuously in her hand,
rubbing its firm glossed sides,
caressing the oily rubbery serpent,
with mouth -watering fulfillment,
fondling its curves with gentle fingers.
Its bearing magnificent and taut
as flanks of a tiger in mid-leap,
she thrusts her blade into
and cuts it open, with lust
on her hot mouth, sweating over the stove,
bandanna round her forehead,
mysterious passion on her face
as she serves me green chile con carne
between soft warm leaves of corn tortillas,
with beans and rice–her sacrifice
to here little prince.
I slurp form my plate
with last bit of tortilla, my mouth burns
and I hiss and drink a tall glass of cold water.
All over New Mexico, sunburned men and women
drive rickety trucks stuffed with gunny sacks
of green chile, from Belen, Beguita, Wllard, Estancia,
San Antonio y Socorro, from fields
to roadside stands, you see them roasting green chile
in screen-sided homemade barrels, and for a dollar a bag,
we relive this old, beautiful ritual again and again."
1322,Emotion,GreenPoemsBlueWallGreenWallPoembyRishaAhmed12yrs,"What comes to my mind when I see a green wall?
A green wall reminds me of the grass so green
And the emerald most rarely seen
A green wall reminds me of the leaves so green
And a forest where I have never been
A green wall reminds me of trees with a lot of shade
And the fresh vegetables kept for trade.
What comes to my mind when I see a blue wall?
It reminds me of the sea so blue
I feel like jumping in it too
A blue wall reminds me of the blue sky
You can’t touch it cause it’s very high
A blue wall reminds me of the deep blue bear
It is very dangerous so beware
A blue wall reminds me of a blue whale
To reach it from the shore you have to sail."

To be shredded and faded—

And sacked by the wind and the sun!"
1326,Emotion,GreenPoems02SeaGreenFirePoembyAshrafulMusaddeq,"High-rise feelings walk in the morning
Southern tempest smells reminiscence
Mind opens the memory-card mutely
Audio-visual art exhibition opens gallery.
Colors march on the parade ground
Sky knows every cool happening
How zero hikes to the region of infinity
Disposable coffee-cup cries at night.
Love runs million kilometers daily
On the highway some nameless zero
Blooms like star within unknown infinity
Unseen sea-green fire set heart on love.

1328,Emotion,GreenPoemsWhoGoesAmidTheGreenWoodPoembyJamesJoyce,"Who goes amid the green wood
With springtide all adorning her?
Who goes amid the merry green wood
To make it merrier?
Who passes in the sunlight
By ways that know the light footfall?
Who passes in the sweet sunlight
With mien so virginal?
The ways of all the woodland
Gleam with a soft and golden fire -- -
For whom does all the sunny woodland
Carry so brave attire?
O, it is for my true love
The woods their rich apparel wear -- -
O, it is for my own true love,
That is so young and fair."
1329,Emotion,GreenPoemsTheGreenBowlPoembyAmyLowell,"This little bowl is like a mossy pool
In a Spring wood, where dogtooth violets grow
Nodding in chequered sunshine of the trees;
A quiet place, still, with the sound of birds,
Where, though unseen, is heard the endless song
And murmur of the never resting sea.
'T was winter, Roger, when you made this cup,
But coming Spring guided your eager hand
And round the edge you fashioned young green leaves,
A proper chalice made to hold the shy
And little flowers of the woods. And here
They will forget their sad uprooting, lost
In pleasure that this circle of bright leaves
Should be their setting; once more they will dream
They hear winds wandering through lofty trees
And see the sun smiling between the leaves."
1330,Emotion,GreenPoemsStubbersGreenPoembyANDREWBLAKEMORE,"Upon the swag of Stubbers Green
Where many ducks and wading birds
And all the geese and seagulls fly
To seek its comfort and the peace
And watch the day go by.
And while the graceful swans do pass
Upon the water flat and calm
Their downy cygnets all in tow
They seek the solace of the reeds
Which on the shoreline grow.
As light does shine and waters gleam
Now diamond ripples dancing free
I feel a whispered gentle breeze
That moves across the golden lake
And through the restless trees.
As on the grassy bank I stand
I gaze upon this tranquil scene
And lean against the tree to shade
My eyes from setting sun so bright
And watch the evening fade."
1331,Emotion,GreenPoemsTheGreenEyeOfTheLittleYellowGodPoembyJohnMiltonHayes,"There's a one-eyed yellow idol to the north of Khatmandu,
There's a little marble cross below the town;
There's a broken-hearted woman tends the grave of Mad Carew,
And the Yellow God forever gazes down.
He was known as ""Mad Carew"" by the subs at Khatmandu,
He was hotter than they felt inclined to tell;
But for all his foolish pranks, he was worshipped in the ranks,
And the Colonel's daughter smiled on him as well.
He had loved her all along, with a passion of the strong,
The fact that she loved him was plain to all.
She was nearly twenty-one and arrangements had begun
To celebrate her birthday with a ball.
He wrote to ask what present she would like from Mad Carew;
They met next day as he dismissed a squad;
And jestingly she told him then that nothing else would do
But the green eye of the little Yellow God.
On the night before the dance, Mad Carew seemed in a trance,
And they chaffed him as they puffed at their cigars:
But for once he failed to smile, and he sat alone awhile,
Then went out into the night beneath the stars.
He returned before the dawn, with his shirt and tunic torn,
And a gash across his temple dripping red;
He was patched up right away, and he slept through all the day,
And the Colonel's daughter watched beside his bed.
He woke at last and asked if they could send his tunic through;
She brought it, and he thanked her with a nod;
He bade her search the pocket saying ""That's from Mad Carew,""
And she found the little green eye of the god.
She upbraided poor Carew in the way that women do,
Though both her eyes were strangely hot and wet;
But she wouldn't take the stone and Mad Carew was left alone
With the jewel that he'd chanced his life to get.
When the ball was at its height, on that still and tropic night,
She thought of him and hurried to his room;
As she crossed the barrack square she could hear the dreamy air
Of a waltz tune softly stealing thro' the gloom.
His door was open wide, with silver moonlight shining through;
The place was wet and slipp'ry where she trod;
An ugly knife lay buried in the heart of Mad Carew,
'Twas the ""Vengeance of the Little Yellow God.""
There's a one-eyed yellow idol to the north of Khatmandu,
There's a little marble cross below the town;
There's a broken-hearted woman tends the grave of Mad Carew,
And the Yellow God forever gazes down."
1332,Emotion,GreenPoemsGreenEyedMonsterOrIagosSongPoembyCharlieFKane,"I hate him,
As I hate Hell and all it’s devils.
I hate him for being better than me,
I hate him for being better than everyone I know,
And I hate him because he is with you.
Why you chose him,
I don’t know.
I have known you for years,
I have told you I love you for years,
I have done nothing but show you my love for years
But you choose him.
You are so beautiful,
And he is so ugly,
You are so elegant,
And he is so common,
You are so perfect,
And he is so flawed.
I will make you see,
That he isn’t good enough for you,
I will make you see,
That I am good for you,
I will make you see,
If I can’t have you,
No man can.

1333,Emotion,GreenPoemsTheGreenSingerPoembyJohnShawNeilson,"ALL singers have shadows
That follow like fears,
But I know a singer
Who never saw tears;
A gay love—a green love—
Delightsome—divine:
The Spring is that singer—
An old love of mine!
All players have shadows,
And into the play
Old sorrows will saunter—
Old sorrows will stay.
But here is a player
Whose speech is divine:
The Spring is that player—
An old love of mine!
All singers grow heavy:
Their hours as they run
Bite up all the blossoms,
Suck up all the sun;
But I know a singer
Delightsome—divine:
The gay love—the green love—
An old love of mine!"

But an old man with a smooth skin
And black hair!
I had the face of a boy as long as I lived,
And for years a soul that was stiff and bent,
In a world which saw me just as a jest,
To be hailed familiarly when it chose,
And loaded up as a man when it chose,
Being neither man nor boy.
In truth it was soul as well as body
Which never matured, and I say to you
That the much-sought prize of eternal youth
Is just arrested growth."

1337,Emotion,GreenPoemsGoGreenSoylentGreenPoembyJoeRosochacki,"It’s matter of fact that earth is going green,
From major corporations to the fluorescent household light bulb,
To the way of life that is to be seen,
After death going green is already in progress for funeral parlors in the UK,
And that is a hit,
- it’s the rage,
Cardboard coffins, clothes sewn from natural fibers, a burial plot in a natural setting.
Green funerals attempt to be eco-friendly at every stage.
It makes a terrific do-it-yourself project,
To have one built from designer cardboard,
-sewn paper bags I would reject,
On ones pocket book that should be breather,
'The trouble is, they are a bit ungainly to use, ' said Oakfield Wood burial ground director Oliver Peacock. 'They're not terribly easy to handle and if it's wet, they don't look their best either.'
Better than being forced to give up one’s life,
To be made into some kind of multi-biochemical compound,
To make the survivors at ease with their strife,
Your last moments so serene,
To Go Soylent Green.

Now cheers my drooping spirit so
Must cold and distant be,
And only light our northern clime
With feeble ray, before the time
I long so much to see.
And this soft whispering breeze that now
So gently cools my fevered brow,
This too, alas, must turn --
To a wild blast whose icy dart
Pierces and chills me to the heart,
Before I cease to mourn.
And these bright flowers I love so well,
Verbena, rose and sweet bluebell,
Must droop and die away.
Those thick green leaves with all their shade
And rustling music, they must fade
And every one decay.
But if the sunny summer time
And woods and meadows in their prime
Are sweet to them that roam --
Far sweeter is the winter bare
With long dark nights and landscapes drear
To them that are at Home!"

Oh list to this incredible tale
Of THOMSON GREEN and HARRIET HALE;
Its truth in one remark you'll sum -
""Twaddle twaddle twaddle twaddle twaddle twaddle twum!""
Oh, THOMSON GREEN was an auctioneer,
And made three hundred pounds a year;
And HARRIET HALE, most strange to say,
Gave pianoforte lessons at a sovereign a day.
Oh, THOMSON GREEN, I may remark,
Met HARRIET HALE in Regent's Park,
Where he, in a casual kind of way,
Spoke of the extraordinary beauty of the day.
They met again, and strange, though true,
He courted her for a month or two,
Then to her pa he said, says he,
""Old man, I love your daughter and your daughter worships me!""
Their names were regularly banned,
The wedding day was settled, and
I've ascertained by dint of search
They were married on the quiet at St. Mary Abbot's Church.
Oh, list to this incredible tale
Of THOMSON GREEN and HARRIET HALE,
Its truth in one remark you'll sum -
""Twaddle twaddle twaddle twaddle twaddle twaddle twum!""
That very self-same afternoon
They started on their honeymoon,
And (oh, astonishment!) took flight
To a pretty little cottage close to Shanklin, Isle of Wight.
But now - you'll doubt my word, I know -
In a month they both returned, and lo!
Astounding fact! this happy pair
Took a gentlemanly residence in Canonbury Square!
They led a weird and reckless life,
They dined each day, this man and wife
(Pray disbelieve it, if you please),
On a joint of meat, a pudding, and a little bit of cheese.
In time came those maternal joys
Which take the form of girls or boys,
And strange to say of each they'd one -
A tiddy-iddy daughter, and a tiddy-iddy son!
Oh, list to this incredible tale
Of THOMSON GREEN and HARRIET HALE,
Its truth in one remark you'll sum -
""Twaddle twaddle twaddle twaddle twaddle twaddle twum!""
My name for truth is gone, I fear,
But, monstrous as it may appear,
They let their drawing-room one day
To an eligible person in the cotton-broking way.
Whenever THOMSON GREEN fell sick
His wife called in a doctor, quick,
From whom some words like these would come -
FIAT MIST. SUMENDUM HAUSTUS, in a COCHLEYAREUM.
For thirty years this curious pair
Hung out in Canonbury Square,
And somehow, wonderful to say,
They loved each other dearly in a quiet sort of way.
Well, THOMSON GREEN fell ill and died;
For just a year his widow cried,
And then her heart she gave away
To the eligible lodger in the cotton-broking way.
Oh, list to this incredible tale
Of THOMSON GREEN and HARRIET HALE,
Its truth in one remark you'll sum -
""Twaddle twaddle twaddle twaddle twaddle twaddle twum!"""

Drives my green age; that blasts the roots of trees

And I am dumb to tell the crooked rose
My youth is bent by the same wintry fever.
The force that drives the water through the rocks
Drives my red blood; that dries the mouthing streams
Turns mine to wax.
And I am dumb to mouth unto my veins
How at the mountain spring the same mouth sucks.
The hand that whirls the water in the pool
Stirs the quicksand; that ropes the blowing wind
Hauls my shroud sail.
And I am dumb to tell the hanging man
How of my clay is made the hangman's lime.
The lips of time leech to the fountain head;
Love drips and gathers, but the fallen blood
Shall calm her sores.
And I am dumb to tell a weather's wind
How time has ticked a heaven round the stars.
And I am dumb to tell the lover's tomb
How at my sheet goes the same crooked worm."

then why have them in the stores?
By the time you think of eating one ripe!
they're full of fruit flies, in the hundreds or maybe more!
My husband loves green bananas
he says, cause they're solid and much more flavorful.
I think they taste kind of green and bitter
with every green and bitter mouthful!
I wonder if monkeys eat them green?
Or do they also wait until they're ripe?
Just peeling them when they're green
leaves those long stringy things of white!
I've taken to freezing mine now
in plastic bags, for my daily protien shakes!
Now I don't have to worry about the ones that turn black!
From the green ones that I wouldn't take!"
1345,Emotion,GreenPoemsSonnetIxYeWhoInAlleysGreenPoembyMaryDarbyRobinson,"Ye, who in alleys green and leafy bow'rs,
Sport, the rude children of fantastic birth;
Where frolic nymphs, and shaggy tribes of mirth,
In clam'rous revels waste the midnight hours;
Who, link'd in flaunting bands of mountain flow'rs,
Weave your wild mazes o'er the dewy earth,
Ere the fierce Lord of Lustre rushes forth,
And o'er the world his beamy radiance pours!
Oft has your clanking cymbal's madd'ning strain,
Loud ringing through the torch-illumin'd grove,
Lur'd my lov'd Phaon from the youthful train,
Through rugged dells, o'er craggy rocks to rove;
Then how can she his vagrant heart detain,
Whose Lyre throbs only to the touch of Love!"
1346,Emotion,GreenPoemsGreenOrBlueLoveHasGreenSignalEverywherePoembyRameshTA,"Love is blue, when lovers are in trouble ever;
Great love stories of the world are so and are
Called as Divine love for the world to know and
Appreciate what love can do to make humans noble!
The greatness of human is measured not by power
Or wealth or intellect, but ever only by love..!
That is why love is placed in the highest pedal
Of human world forever and ever to cherish by all!
When this is so, how can romance be criticized as
Immoral by law or religion anywhere in the world?
Romance is the source for love to bloom between
Two attractive souls both for joy and grief ever!
Religion, literature and law give clean chit to
Mature guy and girl to live in union by marriage
Once they join ever by love that has bloomed as
Natural flowers sans force or by any other means!"
1347,Emotion,GreenPoemsNowSpringHasCladTheGroveInGreenPoembyRobertBurns,"Now spring has clad the grove in green,
And strew'd the lea wi' flowers;
The furrow'd, waving corn is seen
Rejoice in fostering showers:
While ilka thing in nature join
Their sorrows to forego,
O why thus all alone are mine
The weary steps of woe?
The trout in yonder wimpling burn
That glides, a silver dart,
And safe beneath the shady thorn
Defies the angler's art --
My life was ance that careless stream,
That wanton trout was I;
But love, wi' unrelenting beam,
Has scorch'd my fountains dry.
The little flow'ret's peaceful lot,
In yonder cliff that grows,
Which, save the linnet's flight, I wot,
Nae ruder visit knows,
Was mine; till love has o'er me past,
And blighted a' my bloom,
And now beneath the with'ring blast
My youth and joy consume.
The waken'd lav'rock warbling springs,
And climbs the early sky,
Winnowing blythe her dewy wings
In morning's rosy eye:
As little reckt I sorrow's power,
Until the flowery snare
O' witching love, in luckless hour,
Made me the thrall o' care.
O had my fate been Greenland snows,
Or Afric's burning zone,
Wi' man and nature leagu'd my foes,
So Peggy ne'er I'd known!
The wretch whase doom is, ""hope nae mair,""
What tongue his woes can tell!
Within whase bosom, save despair,
Nae kinder spirits dwell."
1348,Emotion,GreenPoemsBeneathTheDarkGreenGrovePoembyMeganCooper,"Lying within the soft waxy grass,
My eyes gently close.
I think of us beneath the trees,
Beneath the dark green grove.
Right here, right now’s where I want to be.
With your arms around me tight,
And the feel of the summer breeze,
And the coming of the humid night.
Not thinking of dreary autumn,
Or when you finally go.
Not thinking of the cold winter,
Or the white frozen snow.
Only thinking of this time with you,
And the perfect ness of this day.
Only thinking of you and your memorizing beauty,
But not when you go away.
I open my eyes and you’re almost real,
In this daydream of mine.
Of course your not really here,
Which makes me go back to the time.
I lay with you in the soft waxy grass,
While my eyelids gently close.
I think of us beneath the trees,
Beneath the dark green grove."
1349,Emotion,GreenPoemsTheseGreenGoingToYellowPoembyMarvinBell,"This year,
I'm raising the emotional ante,
putting my face
in the leaves to be stepped on,
seeing myself among them, that is;
that is, likening
leaf-vein to artery, leaf to flesh,
the passage of a leaf in autumn
to the passage of autumn,
branch-tip and winter spaces
to possibilities, and possibility
to God. Even on East 61st Street
in the blowzy city of New York,
someone has planted a gingko
because it has leaves like fans like hands,
hand-leaves, and sex. Those lovely
Chinese hands on the sidewalks
so far from delicacy
or even, perhaps, another gender of gingko--
do we see them?
No one ever treated us so gently
as these green-going-to-yellow hands
fanned out where we walk.
No one ever fell down so quietly
and lay where we would look
when we were tired or embarrassed,
or so bowed down by humanity
that we had to watch out lest our shoes stumble,
and looked down not to look up
until something looked like parts of people
where we were walking. We have no
experience to make us see the gingko
or any other tree,
and, in our admiration for whatever grows tall
and outlives us,
we look away, or look at the middles of things,
which would not be our way
if we truly thought we were gods."
1350,Emotion,GreenPoemsSetMeWhereasTheSunDothParchTheGreenPoembyHenryHoward,"Set me whereas the sun doth parch the green
Or where his beams do not dissolve the ice,
In temperate heat where he is felt and seen;
In presence prest of people, mad or wise;
Set me in high or yet in low degree,
In longest night or in the shortest day,
In clearest sky or where clouds thickest be,
In lusty youth or when my hairs are gray.
Set me in heaven, in earth, or else in hell;
In hill, or dale, or in the foaming flood;
Thrall or at large, alive whereso I dwell,
Sick or in health, in evil fame or good:
Hers will I be, and only with this thought
Content myself although my chance be nought."
1351,Emotion,GreenPoemsInTheShadeOfTheGreenWoodPoembyANDREWBLAKEMORE,"In the shade of the green wood
The holly does grow,
While in soft rays of sunlight
The wild roses glow,
And I smell their sweet perfume
That gently floats by,
Past trees strong and mighty
That reach to the sky,
The pathway of gold autumn
Leaves still remain,
As I walk through the green wood again.
In the shade of the green wood
This bright sunny morn,
That's so cool in the shadows
A new day is born,
All the birds in the treetops
Are singing for me,
Sweet songs of the summer
Which fill me with glee,
And know from its beauty
I never shall part,
For the green wood does live in my heart.
In the shade of the green wood
A soft gentle breeze,
Now caresses the branches
And whispers through trees,
A sound reassuring
Shall carry me to,
All the scenes that exist
In each marvellous view,
It's here that my spirit
Shall always now stay,
And the green wood is guiding my way."
1352,Emotion,GreenPoemsFormTheGreenHelmetAndOtherPoemsPoembyWilliamButlerYeats,"HIS DREAM
I SWAYED upon the gaudy stem
The butt-end of a steering-oar,
And saw wherever I could turn
A crowd upon a shore.
And though I would have hushed the crowd,
There was no mother's son but said,
'What is the figure in a shroud
Upon a gaudy bed?'
And after running at the brim
Cried out upon that thing beneath
-- It had such dignity of limb --
By the sweet name of Death.
Though I'd my finger on my lip,
What could I but take up the song?
And running crowd and gaudy ship
Cried out the whole night long,
Crying amid the glittering sea,
Naming it with ecstatic breath,
Because it had such dignity,
By the sweet name of Death."
1353,Emotion,GreenPoemsMakeGrassGreenOnYourSidePoembyshrutimodi,"Grass is always green on the other side
But one has to know the other side, to see, weather how green the grass really is?
If you’re trapped then you can feel life in a shell
And not see how good life can be.

Just turn our own precious hearts go green.

1354,Emotion,GreenPoemsTheGreenLinnetPoembyWilliamWordsworth,"BENEATH these fruit-tree boughs that shed
Their snow-white blossoms on my head,
With brightest sunshine round me spread
Of spring's unclouded weather,
In this sequestered nook how sweet
To sit upon my orchard-seat!
And birds and flowers once more to greet,
My last year's friends together.
One have I marked, the happiest guest
In all this covert of the blest:
Hail to Thee, far above the rest
In joy of voice and pinion!
Thou, Linnet! in thy green array,
Presiding Spirit here today,
Dost lead the revels of the May;
And this is thy dominion.
While bird, and butterflies, and flowers,
Make all one band of paramours,
Thou, ranging up and down the bowers,
Art sole in thy employment:
A Life, a Presence like the Air,
Scattering thy gladness without care,
Too blest with any one to pair;
Thyself thy own enjoyment.
Amid yon tuft of hazel trees,
That twinkle to the gusty breeze,
Behold him perched in ecstasies,
Yet seeming still to hover;
There! where the flutter of his wings
Upon his back and body flings
Shadows and sunny glimmerings,
That cover him all over.
My dazzled sight he oft deceives,
A Brother of the dancing leaves;
Then flits, and from the cottage eaves
Pours forth his song in gushes;
As if by that exulting strain
He mocked and treated with disdain
The voiceless Form he chose to feign,
While fluttering in the bushes."

With honest eyes and very true,
How can we again meet
And each kindly treat,
When wise men say there is none you.
Oh bloom that comes again in spring
With green leaves that whisper and sing,
Fragrance so adorable
With colors splendid full,
Candid life to the world you bring.
Oh creature that man has killed
On your earth the blood has spilled,
And broken natures nest
For he thought he knew best,
With folly the forest he filled.
Oh tiger green and sweetly blue
You are now but a dream so true,
Of endangered species gone
That embrace of lead has done,
And soon others will follow you.
Oh Eden's garden's of concrete now
Like hearts of men are somehow,
Made out of chisel stones
Or yellow weathered bones,
A death comes with a blackish crow.
In days that are passed and away
I heard you roaring and play,
With beasts now all lost
Or returned to whited dust,
Like I will likewise do one day.
Oh creatures of this earth so wild
Why hasn’t man treated you mild?
He's within a soul too
But not as innocent nor true,
As one, so of freedom defiled."

And between
Now yellow ways
That I have seen
Leaves of brown
In the town
And streets of gray
In winter's gown
Full of dappled dreams
And gloomy beams
Of its dark mood
In nocturnal seams
Echoing in the city
All its glisten tidy
Of the rimes intrude
Glowing so witty
Hard in its shell
And whitish soft spell
Of little silvery star
Mirroring well
Now is time for gold
Light of twinkling hold
For the times are
Gifts from paper unfold"

from where I sit
only the sun’s protruding rays
between the mountain peak
and the shoulder peak
on my balcony patiently watching
for the flying Xhosa girl
who lives down the road
to pass by, look my way, smile,
and wave a hand…
maybe this time I might convince her
to slow down a bit, and tell me a name…"

Just above your forest sweep,
High above the planes of gold,
Which drought and hunger will evolve.
Green tornado fast asleep,
Underneath the tigers creep,
Through the forest stalking prey,
While far away the dear do play.
For green tornado fast asleep,
You are mother natures keep,
With heart of gold and blood of fire,
The world is yours while men admire."
1360,Emotion,GreenPoems03TheManWithBeautifulGreenEyesPoembynicolaburkett,"Dreaming of the man with beautiful green eyes,
I dream of me sleeping in his arms where I lie,
His breath on my skin his body clenched with mine,
The taste of his kiss is sweeter than wine,
I look up at the man with beautiful green eyes,
Forever in his arms is where I shall lie,
My body underneath wrapped around his,
As I think to myself ‘it can’t get any better than this’,
He whispers of love so tenderly in my ears,
That I look up at him and forget all my fears,
Knowing this moment wasn’t made on a whim,
I feel beautiful and safe when I’m with him,
I’m safe and warm in his arms where I lie,
When I’m with the man, with beautiful green eyes."
1361,Emotion,GreenPoemsGreenPoembyBiancaNA,"Green is the colour of the mangroves at my holiday batch
Green is the feeling of happiness
Green is the colour of the tall oak trees
Green is the sound of crickets buzzing in the summer season

Green is the feeling of success and satisfaction
Green is a pray-mantis hopping around in the garden
Green is the feeling you get on a great holiday
Green is a colour that is safe and alive."
1362,Emotion,GreenPoemsTheGreenHillsOfDruryPoembyAnnBeard,"The city of Auckland its roads spreading wide,
twisting and winding like webs from a spider.
Maori descendents spread culture and pride,
while attempting to tolerate, me the outsider.
To the south of the city, a town Papakura,
Papa (flat) , kura (the precious red earth.)
Home to some wealthy but more often poorer,
inhabitants blessed by free will or by birth.
The suns golden rays caress green hills of Drury,
a small country town, once known for its coal.
Now warming each heart and soul just as surely
as sights of a newly born calf or a foal.
Between these two towns is my home my delight,
trees that alter in shape and texture each year.
Spring colours cause breath to catch at the sight,
Drury Hills bathed in sunlight, heaven so near.
So although not a native and born elsewhere,
forty years it has taken to bring me to being.
So privileged to spend each tomorrow and share,
inspiration  and pleasure in what I am seeing.
Endless blue skies boast of spring over farmland,
branches once naked stretch out to transform.
Rampant is growth seeming wild and unplanned,
tempting blossom and blooms to bask, to feel warm.
And I the outsider have roots bound securely,
in precious red earth that holds secrets of living.
And know as I look to the green hills of Drury.
that Spring  leads our world in the art of forgiving.

1363,Emotion,GreenPoemsGreenFieldsPoembyWilliamStanleyMerwin,"By this part of the century few are left who believe
in the animals for they are not there in the carved parts
of them served on plates and the pleas from the slatted trucks
are sounds of shadows that possess no future
there is still game for the pleasure of killing
and there are pets for the children but the lives that followed
courses of their own other than ours and older
have been migrating before us some are already
far on the way and yet Peter with his gaunt cheeks
and point of white beard the face of an aged Lawrence
Peter who had lived on from another time and country
and who had seen so many things set out and vanish
still believed in heaven and said he had never once
doubted it since his childhood on the farm in the days
of the horses he had not doubted it in the worst
times of the Great War and afterward and he had come
to what he took to be a kind of earthly
model of it as he wandered south in his sixties
by that time speaking the language well enough
for them to make him out he took the smallest roads
into a world he thought was a thing of the past
with wildflowers he scarcely remembered and neighbors
working together scything the morning meadows
turning the hay before the noon meal bringing it in
by milking time husbandry and abundance
all the virtues he admired and their reward bounteous
in the eyes of a foreigner and there he remained
for the rest of his days seeing what he wanted to see
until the winter when he could no longer fork
the earth in his garden and then he gave away
his house land everything and committed himself
to a home to die in an old chateau where he lingered
for some time surrounded by those who had lost
the use of body or mind and as he lay there he told me
that the wall by his bed opened almost every day
and he saw what was really there and it was eternal life
as he recognized at once when he saw the gardens
he had made and the green fields where he had been
a child and his mother was standing there then the wall would close
and around him again were the last days of the world"

how easy it is to talk with you

So easy to talk with you
no matter where the body is

(we can pick up where we left off
or leave off where we can pick up) .
There is no beginning and no end.
Only, the comfortable...now."
1365,Emotion,GreenPoemsSmallIsTheTrustWhenLoveIsGreenPoembyRobertLouisStevenson,"SMALL is the trust when love is green
In sap of early years;
A little thing steps in between
And kisses turn to tears.
Awhile - and see how love be grown
In loveliness and power!
Awhile, it loves the sweets alone,
But next it loves the sour.
A little love is none at all
That wanders or that fears;
A hearty love dwells still at call
To kisses or to tears.
Such then be mine, my love to give,
And such be yours to take:-
A faith to hold, a life to live,
For lovingkindness' sake:
Should you be sad, should you be gay,
Or should you prove unkind,
A love to hold the growing way
And keep the helping mind:-
A love to turn the laugh on care
When wrinkled care appears,
And, with an equal will, to share
Your losses and your tears."

As  the world blooming in brilliance
And you lead me the way by your grace
As the green meadow flecks by the sun
Across the time of commitments
when owned by the intimacy
I simply followed you like a shadow
Even onto the last dregs of the night
Yet with all letters of resilience
I blink to the edges of the night abiding
yet frightened by the afflicted ember
faith seems to fledges when intoned
As your words whisper me of the rising sun
Even if grimaced by the winter chilled
Still light blazes the earth by the art of creation
When you stand by me by guiding agility"

Without a city wall,
Where the dear Lord was crucified,
Who died to save us all.
We may not know, we cannot tell
What pains he had to bear,
But we believe it was for us
He hung and suffer’d there.
He died that we might be forgiven,
He died to make us good,
That we might go at last to heaven,
Sav’d by his precious blood.
There was no other good enough
To pay the price of sin;
He only could unlock the gate
Of heaven, and let us in.
O dearly, dearly has he lov’d,
And we must love him too,
And trust in his redeeming blood,
And try his works to do."

Some tiny leaves of tender green

The hedgerows will be clad anew.
Though it will take a week or two.
We will say goodbye to winters reign
and welcome back the spring again.
The sun grows stronger day by day
and blue replaces skies of grey.
My old bones will appreciate
the warmth although they’ll have to wait
A little longer for relief
I am quite sure it will be brief.

1372,Emotion,GreenPoemsAsThroughTheWildGreenHillsOfWyrePoembyAlfredEdwardHousman,"As through the wild green hills of Wyre
The train ran, changing sky and shire,
And far behind, a fading crest,
Low in the forsaken west
Sank the high-reared head of Clee,
My hand lay empty on my knee.
Aching on my knee it lay:
That morning half a shire away
So many an honest fellow's fist
Had well-nigh wrung it from the wrist.
Hand, said I, since now we part
From fields and men we know by heart,
For strangers' faces, strangers' lands,--
Hand, you have held true fellows' hands.
Be clean then; rot before you do
A thing they'll not believe of you.
You and I must keep from shame
In London streets the Shropshire name;
On banks of Thames they must not say
Severn breeds worse men than they;
And friends abroad must bear in mind
Friends at home they leave behind.
Oh, I shall be stiff and cold
When I forget you, hearts of gold;
The land where I shall mind you not
Is the land where all's forgot.
And if my foot returns no more
To Teme nor Corve nor Severn shore,
Luck, my lads, be with you still
By falling stream and standing hill,
By chiming tower and whispering tree,
Men that made a man of me.
About your work in town and farm
Still you'll keep my head from harm,
Still you'll help me, hands that gave
A grasp to friend me to the grave."

Which blend with joyful harmony
Beneath the peaceful summer skies.

So glad to be alive this day,
To see the new shoots of the wheat
And hedgerows now adorned with May.
Along the country lane I head
Not caring where it leads me to,
I know wherever I am led
I'll always find a pleasing view.
Beneath the bridge a river flows
Where ripples dance and brightly shine,
Like diamonds as the water glows
And winds unto this heart of mine.
The sweeping slopes of light and shade
Where clouds now cast their shade before,
With all the beauty there displayed
No man could ever ask for more.
So green the land that I can see
With gladdened soul I now do roam,
And as I go I say with glee
Fair England always be my home."

1376,Emotion,GreenPoemsGreenPoembyWildBillBalding,"Into the warm, inviting yellow
twists a brush loaded with blue.
Surprised, suspicious,
the shades swirl round each other,
and then, by magic,
marbled patterns turn
to startling viridian.
It is utterly final.
Once made, the new colour
cannot be undone;
once committed, the blue and yellow
cannot be divorced:
this is a lifelong union,
longer by far than the life
of the artist who mixed it.
So it is with you and me:
bearing our separate lives
we have swirled and marbled,
mixed and mingled,
become one,
created a new colour
with an as yet unknown chemistry.
Together, we make green;
and, though parted for a while,
yellow does not leave blue
and blue does not rip itself from yellow.
Instead, two emerald puddles,
distant in space but not tone,
dream of being plastered on a palette,
poured into a pot,
indissolubly one.
For now, our separate lives continue
and we wait,
rationed to fragments of time,
which moves on,
as love itself draws breath
and looks forward to our next meeting."

Your poor scalp will burn, your eyes will burn too!

1379,Emotion,GreenPoemsGreenThumbPoembyPhilipLevine,"Shake out my pockets! Harken to the call
Of that calm voice that makes no sound at all!
Take of me all you can; my average weight
May make amends for this, my low estate.
But do not shake, Green Thumb, as once you did
My heart and liver, or my prostate bid
Good Morning to -- leave it, the savage gland
Content within the mercy of my hand.
The world was safe in winter, I was spring,
Enslaved and rattling to the slightest thing
That she might give. If planter were my trade
Why was I then not like a planter made:
With veins like rivers, smudge-pots for a soul,
A simple mind geared to a simple goal?
You fashioned me, great headed and obscene
On two weak legs, the weakest thing between.
My blood was bubbling like a ten-day stew;
it kept on telling me the thing to do.
I asked, she acquiesced, and then we fell
To private Edens in the midst of hell.
For forty days temptation was our meal,
The night our guide, and what we could not feel
We could not trust. Later, beneath the bed,
We found you taking notes of all we said.
At last we parted, she to East Moline,
I to the service of the great unseen.
All the way home I watched a circling crow
And read your falling portents in the snow.
I burned my clothes, I moved, I changed my name,
But every night, unstamped her letter came:
""Ominous cramps and pains."" I cursed the vows
That cattle make to grass when cattle browse.
Heartsick and tired, to you, Green Thumb, I prayed
For her reprieve and that our debt be paid
By my remorse. ""Give me a sign,"" I said,
""Give me my burning bush."" You squeaked the bed.
I hid my face like Moses on the hill,
But unlike Moses did not feel my will
Swell with new strength; I put my choice to sleep.
That night we cowered, choice and I, like sheep.
When I awoke I found beneath the door
Only the invoice from the liquor store.
The grape-vine brought the word. I switched to beer:
She had become a civil engineer.
When I went walking birds and children fled.
I took my love, myself, behind the shed;
The shed burned down. I switched to milk and eggs.
At night a dream ran up and down my legs.
I have endured, as Godless Nazarite,
Life like a bone even a dog would slight;
All that the dog would have, I have refused.
May I, of all your subjects, be excused?
The world is yours, Green Thumb; I smell your heat
Licking the winter to a green defeat.
The creatures join, the coupling seasons start;
Leave me, Green Thumb, my solitary part."
1380,Emotion,GreenPoemsBlackOrGreenPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"A racist who was loud and mean
arrived with buddies on the scene.
They pointed fingers at the Black
and then prepared for an attack.
The black boy asked why they would pick
to beat and torture with a stick
a little boy who'd done no wrong
the racist said 'you look like Kong.
'It is the colour that we hate
that's why we now will beat you, mate.'
The fellow pleaded, 'don't be mean,
I think I am a shade of green.'
The racists, though, yelled, 'never mind,
we're white and also colourblind.'"
1381,Emotion,GreenPoemsMayInTheGreenWoodPoembyAnonymous,"IN somer when the shawes be sheyne,

Hit is full merry in feyre foreste
To here the foulys song.
To se the dere draw to the dale
And leve the hilles hee,
And shadow him in the leves grene
Under the green-wode tree.
Hit befell on Whitsontide
Early in a May mornyng,
The Sonne up faire can shyne,
And the briddis mery can syng.
'This is a mery mornyng,' said Litulle Johne,
'Be Hym that dyed on tre;

For the first time, now for the first time seen."
1383,Emotion,GreenPoemsAGirlWithBlueGreenHairPoembyMaryRyan,"One Sunday morning I hurried on my way
And I arrived at my church ready to worship and pray
Then I saw a girl with blue-green hair
She walked away, not welcome there
I could see the tears falling down her face
I realized that I didn’t want to be in such a place
I looked at myself in my dress so neat
And then at the girl in her jeans and dusty bare feet
“Don’t be sad because you were turned away
We’ll find us a church where we both can stay”
With a smile on my face, I took her hand
And we both walked away from my church so grand
Soon a small wooden building I chanced to see
A young man smiled and greeted both her and me
The doors I saw were thrown open wide
“There’s a place for you both just right inside”
So many different people all worshipping the Lord
And the truth being preached straight from His Word
A place was found for us side by side
Welcomed by His love that we often hide
Let all church doors be thrown open wide
And all who approach be welcomed inside
Whether it be a woman with a refined air
Or a barefoot girl with blue-green hair"
1384,Emotion,GreenPoemsGreenSoldiersPoembyFloydZimmerman,"The Armies marched with banging drums
That made ill the streams, made black the dreams.
The Armies marched with cracking horns,
Each soldier robed in robes of green.
With green swords they cut her down,
Greyed her hairs and dimmed her smiles.
Their drums rung around her ears,
Their trophies hung within her tears.
But, in the night Turning Tide
Brought Light, who shone to crack the ice
That Time had made cold and hard
Around each green soldiers heathen heart.
Whispers. Whispers in my ears and in the hills.
'The ice will crack; the blood will flow',
The ice did crack, the blood ran cold
And drowned each green soldiers heathen soul.
We stood just to watch them die,
Let them bleed until their hearts bled dry.
Alas! things could never be the same
With her smiles so dim and her hairs so grey."
1385,Emotion,GreenPoemsAnIrishColleenWasDressedInGreenPoembyDanielMcDonagh,"It was on Kerrydale Street that I did meet
A pretty young girl from Dublin Town,
This Irish colleen was dressed in green
She was in Glasgow to visit the Holy Ground.
I asked her, her name before the start of the game
As we both entered through Parkhead’s turnstiles,
Her name was Shannon, like the river in Ireland,
As I shook her hand and gave her a smile.
In the Jock Stein Stand, all the Celtic fans
Stood to applaud the Celts onto the park,
I looked for Shannon as she cheered on Neil Lennon,
As her Celtic shirt had Lennon 18 on the back.
When the game was done and the Celtic had won
I walked her up Janefield Street back into the city centre,
And we went for a jar at a local Celtic bar,
Mines was a Guinness as she drank a pint of cider.
We drank all night wearing our green & white
For the next morning she was returning home to Dublin,
She scribbled her home number on my cigarette packet
As she boarded a bus leaving Buchanan Street bus station.
For the rest of the season she would travel over from Dublin
Outside the Brazen Head pub we would meet,
And now, my bags are packed, with 200 fags,
As I am marrying Shannon, in Dublin next week.

1386,Emotion,GreenPoemsGreenGodsAndAgnosticReadersOfCompostPoembyTedSheridan,"Poet, having read your words; I wanted you to know
that I can see the trees you planted as I chop down
the hardest wood  for my fires. I used the vacated
bird nests you guarded like a fanatic steward for kindling;
the birds having all moved into their new government
subsidized gated condo communities down south. Poet,
having considered your elitist and liberal metaphors; I find them
to be plagiaristic and cliché at best…and similar to the precious trees
you attempt to protect, they are a but another renewable
source of fuel for the woodchucks and beavers like me
who are in need of expressing an occasional Damn!
Poet, green is no longer just the color of envy
but in has become the color of your gods…
And because I am forewarned, I am so forearmed with knowledge
to defeat your poor examples and attempts at self expression.
Poet, having gone into the wilderness; hugged the trees and bunnies
you have still failed to silence the wind and blasphemous dissuader
who dehorts all of your creations as politics.
And although I am just a reader, you should know
I am not a believer in search of a cause….

1387,Emotion,GreenPoemswhereTheBlueKissesGreenPoembyLindaMoore,"Glancing off to the distance, horizons set for me
There is a point where vivid green meets the deep blue of Sea
Feet bare to touch the green, first one, then the other
To the Quite place, unencumbered by the clutter
Above the light warms, rays of golden sun
Anticipating silence, feet are free to run
Calming in the stillness, free of all thought
Relaxed and just listening, knowledge sought
Being part of Nature, absorbed into air
Weightless and fluid, Peace is declared
Where green meets the blue, iridescent in gold
Listening in quite, for Mystery to unfold"
1388,Emotion,GreenPoemsMySageGreenRobePoembyErnestineNorthover,"I sit on my bed, and look across at my sage green towelling robe,
hanging on the back of the bedroom door.
Does he still 'fancy' me,
when I'm wearing it,
probably not,
it's not 'sexy', rather 'frumpy' really,
not at all an 'exciting' piece of clothing.
A dowdy bird,
dowdy and unheard!
I think that's me!
A 'new' me, must emerge from that robe.
A butterfly from a chrysalis,
A rose from a bud.
I think I need an overhaul, and a new 'robe',
like you see the 'famous' wearing,
in their 'penthouses'.
A glorious creation of satin and silk,
like flowing cream and milk.
Mind you, my towelling robe, hangs next to his towelling robe,
so perhaps we will do the same, and remain side by side,
and perhaps he loves me for other things than just being,
glamorous.
Hanging there, they look at peace with each other,
so I think I'll stick with my sage green towelling robe,
it cuddles me, just like he does!

1389,Emotion,GreenPoemsAGreenCrabsShellPoembyMarkDoty,"Not, exactly, green:
closer to bronze
preserved in kind brine,
something retrieved
from a Greco-Roman wreck,
patinated and oddly
muscular. We cannot
know what his fantastic
legs were like--
though evidence
suggests eight
complexly folded
scuttling works
of armament, crowned
by the foreclaws'
gesture of menace
and power. A gull's
gobbled the center,
leaving this chamber
--size of a demitasse--
open to reveal
a shocking, Giotto blue.
Though it smells
of seaweed and ruin,
this little traveling case
comes with such lavish lining!
Imagine breathing
surrounded by
the brilliant rinse
of summer's firmament.
What color is
the underside of skin?
Not so bad, to die,
if we could be opened
into this--
if the smallest chambers
of ourselves,
similarly,
revealed some sky."
1390,Emotion,GreenPoemsALushGreenGardenPoembyDavidHarris,"Before the first ray of sunlight
on a frosty winter morn.
The frost has hazed the windows
to a feature of lands
long before our life began.
To the time when dragons ruled the world
with their hot breath and thunderous roars.
However, the gods were not happy
with their chosen rulers
and banished them away.
The crown they then handed to man
in hope for a better job done.
Since then man has ruined
everything his eyes gazed on.
Therefore, like the dragons of long ago,
the gods may decide in time
to banish man as well.
Returning this planet
to the lush green garden
that it used to be."
1391,Emotion,GreenPoemsMeetMeInTheGreenGlenPoembyJohnClare,"Love, meet me in the green glen,
Beside the tall elm-tree,
Where the sweetbriar smells so sweet agen;
There come with me.
Meet me in the green glen.
Meet me at the sunset
Down in the green glen,
Where we've often met
By hawthorn-tree and foxes' den,
Meet me in the green glen.
Meet me in the green glen,
By sweetbriar bushes there;
Meet me by your own sen,
Where the wild thyme blossoms fair.
Meet me in the green glen.
Meet me by the sweetbriar,
By the mole-hill swelling there;
When the west glows like a fire
God's crimson bed is there.
Meet me in the green glen."
1392,Emotion,GreenPoemsMenInGreenPoembyDavidCampbell,"Oh, there were fifteen men in green,
Each with a tommy-gun,
Who leapt into my plane at dawn;
We rose to meet the sun.
We set our course towards the east
And climbed into the day
Till the ribbed jungle underneath
Like a giant fossil lay.
We climbed towards the distant range,
Where two white paws of cloud
Clutched at the shoulders of the pass;
The green men laughed aloud.
They did not fear the ape-like cloud
That climbed the mountain crest
And hung from ropes invisible
With lightning in its breast.
They did not fear the summer's sun
In whose hot centre lie
A hundred hissing cannon shells
For the unwatchful eye.
And when on Dobadura's field
We landed, each man raised
His thumb towards the open sky;
But to their right I gazed.
For fifteen men in jungle green
Rose from the kunai grass
And came towards the plane. My men
In silence watched them pass;
It seemed they looked upon themselves
In Times's prophetic glass.
Oh, there were some leaned on a stick
And some on stretchers lay,
But few walked on their own two feet
In the early green of day.
(They did not heed the ape-like cloud
That climbed the mountain crest;
They did not fear the summer sun
With bullets for their breast.)
Their eyes were bright, their looks were dull;
Their skin had turned to clay.
Nature had meet them in the night
And stalked them in the day.
And I think still of men in green
On the Soputa track,
With fifteen spitting tommy-guns
To keep the jungle back."
1393,Emotion,MoneyPoemsMoneyMattersPoembyIndiraRenganathan,"Professed striving, thriving in kitchen life
Woman of yesterday was a home maid
Call her not a homemaker or housewife
A home maid unpaid and future benighted
Illiterate slave literate in home science
Deprived of finance for days ahead
Suppressed in fearful negligence
Dear and near, not to be truly so supposed
Necessity out of such a pity
Woman of olden time
Saved in her kitty
Annas, paise to chime.
Unreally smiling out of disguised injustice
Done to her by a domestic law
To herself collected coins, fortune to splice
Woman of moral law
Begotten parental assets begotten
Life raised husband and his folks
Counting her collection the woman forlorn
From mercy somebody the beseeched alms
Her pouch of coins didn't change
Unchanged the least quantum amount too
No depositing, no investing to challange
No interest, no dividend to woo
Passed on from husband to son
Hopes on despair built
Survival of a grand-ma's funeral now to shun.
Stealthily on money matters spoken about.
On her couch of death
Ready to depart her pouch.
Struggling through her last breath
Her savings presented to her funeral march"
1394,Emotion,MoneyPoemsMoneyTalksPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"Money talks
Put it to work
Watch your world spin & rock
Money talks
But when it fucks with you
Money sucks
Without money, we are in poverty
With money, you are my property
If you are very ugly, don’t worry
There is expensive plastic surgery
If you are one who is totally boring
Spend, spend, spend and stop worrying
Who says money can't buy you love
Who says money can't buy you friends
Who says money can't buy you fame
We all live and die the money game
Money talks
Hit the jackpot
Watch the media flock
Paparazzis, children, grown-ups
Chasing you from block to block
The previous known vagabond
People now no longer mock
You ceased being a laughing stock
Now they want a share of your buck
Ignoring money talk, is not that simple
Many have thrown away their principles
Listening to money talk
It is the master of love & hate
It is the master of a smile & a frown
It is the master of respect & disrespect
It’s the difference between a good & a bad friend
Money talks
If you listen to it
You become its slave
The only path it paves
Waits silently to crush you
With an evil gigantic wave

1395,Emotion,MoneyPoemsfunnyHoneyMoneyPoembyKaspaRichards,"Seems everyone just hates to see me change
But my brain feels maimed with no ambition of fame
Just money and its funny all I want is that and my honey
Coz the rest are all dummies and I can’t get chummy
With new people who are feeble, fake, and evil
And old friends who crossed me are no longer equals
So i'm use to standing alone prone to breaking thrones
A war zone is my home and a battling I shall go
No love for my peers not after all these years
I won’t shed a tear to hear u all lost what is dear
Coz u haven’t got a clue on what it means to be true
All u do is front, your lost in an image that isn’t you
Like your all a heard of sheep, your all the same no one is unique
U will never reach the peak with all that rubbish you speak
A petty lil criminal running his mouth like he hard is so pitiful
Taking advice from a prisoner? U idiot that’s why u minimal
Wise up learn from the quiet ones before your freedom is critical"
1396,Emotion,MoneyPoemsIfYouHaveMoneyProblemsPoembyFrancisDuggan,"If you have money problems your problems are not small
And that money speaks all languages that goes for one and all
But that money cannot buy happiness that seems so very true
And to the battlers who keep keeping on great credit must be due,
There are so many paupers for every millionaire
And for millions of people life must seem so unfair
It truly is a rat race in the bigger World out there
And people with compassion have never been so rare,
The poor keep getting poorer whilst the wealthy more wealthy grow
And like tis said how one half live the other half would not know
And an egalatarian World from us seems far away
And even in so called wealthy Nations poverty is rife today
And if you have money problems and are in financial strife
then you are made to struggle with the cross you bear in life."
1397,Emotion,MoneyPoemsMoneyIsntTheAnswerPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"Can money give you ample sleep at night?
Can money bring you satiety you want?
Can money soothe the heart and mind aggrieved?
Can money resurrect a person dead?
Can money cause fertility in wombs?
Can money heal the wounds of minds and hearts?
Can money make up for one’s parents’ love?
Can money work a miracle you want?
Can money cure a cancer of grade four?
Can money bring joy to a childless pair?
Can money purchase your seat in heaven?
Can money solve all problems that you face?
There are so many things money can’t do;
Your trust in God and labor, matter too.

1398,Emotion,MoneyPoemsMoneyPoembyDanaGioia,"Money is a kind of poetry.
- Wallace Stevens
Money, the long green,
cash, stash, rhino, jack
or just plain dough.
Chock it up, fork it over,
shell it out. Watch it
burn holes through pockets.
To be made of it! To have it
to burn! Greenbacks, double eagles,
megabucks and Ginnie Maes.
It greases the palm, feathers a nest,
holds heads above water,
makes both ends meet.
Money breeds money.
Gathering interest, compounding daily.
Always in circulation.
Money. You don't know where it's been,
but you put it where your mouth is.
And it talks."
1399,Emotion,MoneyPoemsMoneyCanTBuyTankaPoembyMarvinBratoSr,"The rich and famous
can buy almost everything,
As long cash pours in.
Money can buy happiness,
but never true contentment!"
1400,Emotion,MoneyPoemsWhatIsTheValueOfMoneyPoembyJuliusBabarinsa,"Money we all know is a medium of exchange
Buyers and sellers relate to each other through money
The question here is – what is the value of money?
Few say money is the root of all evil
Many say money is the root of prosperity
And how valuable is money
Almost everything is measured by money
People go to work everyday because of money
Wealth of individuals is measured by money
All purchases and transactions are made by money
Every country has a name for its own money
The importance of some countries
In based on the value of their money
What is the value of money?
The rise and fall of foreign exchange
Is used to measure the value of money
Success to many is also measured by money
Corporate positions are measured by money
There are some people who marry for money
What is the value of money?
To many, money is everything
You cannot get many things done without money
Many have pondered and contemplated to ask
Can human beings live without money?
Then, how shall we determine and decide
The prices of individuals and materials
Differences between the rich and the poor
Are calculated in monetary terms
The power bestowed by money
Seems bigger than imagined"
1401,Emotion,MoneyPoemsMoneyTalksPoembyivororivorehogg,"The village streets are dark and cold.
Most stay at home and watch T.V
Its not the place it used be
when coal was king in days of old.
When miners earned a princely wage.
The village pubs were thriving then,
those days will never come again.
Commuting now is all the rage.
The  many pubs  are all closed down
the shops have dwindled to a few.
There is so little we can do
We have shop in the next town.
But they are building everywhere.
New houses thrown up in a flash
For other folk who have the cash
The planners do not seem to care.
This valley is a beauty spot
where tacky houses spoil the view.
An old complaint forever new
I can complain. Why should I not.
I’m not against making progress.,
Sometimes a change is for the best
when it is made at our request.
It seems our choice grows ever less.
The speculators buy the land.
Pull down the pubs which they replace
with houses tightly packed in place.
The only thing they understand.
is how much profit they can make.
Their balance sheets must always show
how they can make their money grow.
They are in charge make no mistake.."
1402,Emotion,MoneyPoemsMoneyMoneyPoembyElizabethPadilloOlesen,"Money, Money, give me some more

1403,Emotion,MoneyPoemsDueToMoneyPoembyFrancisDuggan,"Due to money good friendships have come to an end
For money can make an enemy out of a friend
And due to money many are serving prison time
For money or lack of it leads many to serious crime
Due to money the Fifth Commandment has often been broken it does seem sad to say
That some with their lives due to money do pay
Those who say money is not important to reality not true
If you owe someone a lot of money for Court you are due
Whoever say money is not important believe their own lie
People have been bashed over money and left there to die
And people due to money feel happy to deceive
And that it does speak every language you ought to believe
Yes money out of a friend can make a foe
I am telling you something you already know."
1404,Emotion,MoneyPoemsALifeWithoutMoneyPoembyRameshTA,"Could it be possible to live without money?
Why can’t man live without money in the world?
Long back I saw an African movie about this;
It is called “Gods Must Be Crazy! ”
One can get the idea to live without money!
Even today people are living life in farm houses
Far away from the civilised world of materialism
Without needing money for any purpose there!
In the forest and farm houses far away from towns
Life of the people needs no money at all it seems!
We can live without money but not without hunger!
Nature has given hunger and also all things to survive;
It is man’s own creation to live as slaves of comforts
In the world where nothing is permanent in time bound life!"

That money hast to say alot about human term's,
Every word that is explained here told me,
That money hast talked in society,
The honey of Humanity,
In the status of money,
If your'e indigent,
Many men will neglect all that you have,
Even humiliate you,
Only because they have money,
They mistreat others,
Money hast talked alot about what people do everyday,
Money is root of all not good,
Even most virus is from money,
Getting drunk talk's all about money,
Forever and ever men really love money,
We need money,
But some are very greedy for money,
Money talk's alot about fables and false spirit's."
1406,Emotion,MoneyPoemsInAWorldWhereMoneyMattersPoembyFrancisDuggan,"He is sixty his hair dyed brown and she is a natural blond of nineteen
And strolling hand in hand along the beach road every evening they are seen
His grandchildren as old as she is it is so true what they say
That money does speak every language and it has always been this way.
In a World where money matters men of money seem to rule
And with a rolls royce in his garage and an indoor heated swimming pool
She must see him as a good catch though he is years beyond his prime
And he is smitten by her beauty and he buys her a good time.
One less attractive young woman for to woo for the single young males of the town
For the fellow in his sixties she has turned all suitors down
Those who say love only matters must believe in their own lie
She has knocked back men of her own age for to be with the wealthy older guy.
To those who talk of love and passion pay no heed to what they say
For in a World where money matters the sugar daddy leads the way
To find himself a young beauty he doesn't even have to try
For in a World where money matters there's little money cannot buy.
He is sixty his hair dyed brown and he goes walking hand in hand
With a young beauty of nineteen and that's not hard to understand
For in a World where money matters he is a known millionaire
And the young males of him jealous doesn't life seem very unfair?"

Wearing cotton and linen dress,
Attiring security thread, so clear,
The soil's water mark, run over,
Who make you so authoritative?
Every human falls for your eye wink,
The colors chosen to brighten you,
Every one of you worth to be adored,
When men's sweat worth your value,
Who make you so perfect?
How many master engravers work on you,
To have the perfect portrait and border,
Are you exposed to UV lights to get burnt?
After bathing, you do go for press setting,
Everyone work on you to make your mold,
The details of dots, fine lines, design and text,
Historical images on your face,
The signature at your hips,
Tight security at your birth place,
Transferred to the destinations,
In armored vehicles,
When you go on the streets,
With the siren on and blinking,
Everyone looks at you in desperation,
The children shouts, ‘Money, Money', ."

And you are not happy."
1412,Emotion,MoneyPoemsMoneyPoembyIndiraRenganathan,"Stolen by poverty
Let stolen by 'antipoverty'
Might of the mint is an effigy
Endorsed in life's kinetic journey
Rags to riches coiled in coinage
Birth to death in currency-appendage
Food, clothe, shelter hike
Varied labour-men when strike
Target is money-market
Goal is money-profit
Craze is gold locket
Racing in final syndromic silt
To be is to be knowledgeable
Enough is enough satiable
Fear is to fear avarice
Beware is beware of vice, malice
And
Don't we just opine of money a demon
Don't just opine of money either a daemon
Born in this country
We to deify money, Goddess Lakshmi
Bestower of wealth and morality"
1413,Emotion,MoneyPoemsWealthyManDonTHoardYourMoneyPoembyFrancisDuggan,"Some one else will own your property when you are dead and gone
The day you die the World won't stop life it will carry on
You've made it big, you've reached the top, you're plutocratic kind
But wealthy guy you too must die and leave your wealth behind.
You came out of your mother free of guilt and evil sin
But now you're just a money hoarder like all other greedy men,
Your dreams of wealth have all come true you are now a millionaire
But moneyed man you too will die as sure as cows wear hair.
There's nothing wrong with money without money man can't live
But in a man there must be what is known as take and give
And just like all other greedy men you never give but take
And the more money you accumulate the more you want to make.
Wealthy man don't hoard your money, don't be scared to spend a pound
Or someone else will spend it for you when your bones rest underground
Everybody hates a miser, no one loves a greedy soul
And you too will be forgotten when you're placed in earthy hole."
1414,Emotion,MoneyPoemsSonnetMoneyAintTheAnswerPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"Money, we seek in life to fulfil needs;
Most labour hard to gain some extra wealth;
Some even go on to do evil deeds,
And in the process, spoil their body's health.
Money evades some persons for quite long;
Some get it accidentally, by luck;
Some acquire it through a single song;
But happiness can't come to all by buck.
For, money can't give bliss for all on earth;
Money can't solve all problems in our life;
Neither can it ensure a divine berth;
Money can bring a man unwanted strife.
And yet, the human mind stays money-mad,
Forgetting Almighty God; Oh, how sad!"

1416,Emotion,MoneyPoemsMoneyPoembySaudatuKabir,"Money is precious money is power
Money is a devil cunning and evil
Source of war destruction of nations
Money causes hatred money unites
Money is lovely it attracts like a magnet
Cupboard love is given for money
Money is a master, it instructs we surrender
Money has rules we follow blindly
Cheating and stealing are done for money
Money gives power money gives respect
Money can earn you a stay in a coffin
Root of evil, source of happiness
Money is wonderful, money is Eden
Money is a murderer it kills like a cobra
Rejoice with money, cry for money
Money is a stinging bee, money is delicious
Money is sweet as sweet as honey
Once you lick it you’ll die for money.
Money is war, money is peace
Money’s path is deception, cheating and enmity
People kill and get killed for money.
Money is attractive, money glitters
Money does make one act like a dummy
Petrified can’t move, like Egyptian mummy.
Money and power are closely related
Money is power, power is money
Too much money  may mean power and misery."
1417,Emotion,MoneyPoemsFoolsMoneyBagsPoembyAmyLowell,"Outside the long window,
With his head on the stone sill,
The dog is lying,
Gazing at his Beloved.
His eyes are wet and urgent,
And his body is taut and shaking.
It is cold on the terrace;
A pale wind licks along the stone slabs,
But the dog gazes through the glass
And is content.
The Beloved is writing a letter.
Occasionally she speaks to the dog,
But she is thinking of her writing.
Does she, too, give her devotion to one
Not worthy?"

We crave to be masters of money
or end up to be money´s slaves.
Either way, we fall into the pit

and we end up, enslaved by money.
Money is only a gift to use and share
It cannot last for long, for like water,

Ask for money and work for it

to use, share and give to those in need."

many people become inslave to the almighty dollar
it fuels an economy it ends an nation

it causes desperration and sets chains to oneself

people who lack it want it
people who have it want more
money is infatuation it can bring you sex from a whore
but it blinds you from the ones you should adore
it affects brain it brings stress to your state of mind, it leaves your head with a receeded hair line
it pollutes the world because money is toxicity, it causes you to over eat and it leaves you with obesity
it can be a stab in the back a kick in the ass, it can leave you in the street wishin you were in the past
it produces greed it plants the seed of something you cant live without and something you need
it speaks every language and its never ignored, we give money to the church because they say its for the lord
thats bullshit, if in worship we are the performers, and God is the audience that we see, shouldnt worship be free?
survival of the fittest in this time people are working from 9 to 5 for the nickel dime
a cancer in society a false form piety
a fake form of religion shared by the royalty with an undying loyalty
without it you have fear of where are you going to be next year
gives you a sense of importance that you can sit but really your nothing but a piece of shit
money creates a nation that divides within a class you reside with the rules that you have to abide
before you know it you have died.
murder, genocide, for piece of paper, it comes and goes and evaporates like a vapor
its a big chip on your back its should be the number one cause of death not a heart attack

1424,Emotion,MoneyPoemsMoneyPoembyWilliamHenryDavies,"When I had money, money, O!
I knew no joy till I went poor;
For many a false man as a friend
Came knocking all day at my door.
Then felt I like a child that holds
A trumpet that he must not blow
Because a man is dead; I dared
Not speak to let this false world know.
Much have I thought of life, and seen
How poor men’s hearts are ever light;
And how their wives do hum like bees
About their work from morn till night.
So, when I hear these poor ones laugh,
And see the rich ones coldly frown—
Poor men, think I, need not go up
So much as rich men should come down.
When I had money, money, O!
My many friends proved all untrue;
But now I have no money, O!
My friends are real, though very few."

1426,Emotion,MoneyPoemsVelocityOfMoneyPoembyAllenGinsberg,"I’m delighted by the velocity of money as it whistles through the windows
of Lower East Side
Delighted by skyscrapers rising the old grungy apartments falling on
84th Street
Delighted by inflation that drives me out on the street
After all what good’s the family farm, why eat turkey by thousands every
Thanksgiving?
Why not have Star Wars? Why have the same old America?!?
George Washington wasn’t good enough! Tom Paine pain in the neck,
Whitman what a jerk!
I’m delighted by double digit interest rates in the Capitalist world
I always was a communist, now we’ll win
an usury makes the walls thinner, books thicker & dumber
Usury makes my poetry more valuable
my manuscripts worth their weight in useless gold -
Now everybody’s atheist like me, nothing’s sacred
buy and sell your grandmother, eat up old age homes,
Peddle babies on the street, pretty boys for sale on Times Square -
You can shoot heroin, I can sniff cocaine,
macho men can fite on the Nicaraguan border and get paid with paper!
The velocity’s what counts as the National Debt gets higher
Everybody running after the rising dollar
Crowds of joggers down broadway past City Hall on the way to the Fed
Nobody reads Dostoyevsky books so they’ll have to give a passing ear
to my fragmented ravings in between President’s speeches
Nothing’s happening but the collapse of the Economy
so I can go back to sleep till the landlord wins his eviction suit in court."

Money to burn

It will be back to cover your needs"

Get a good job with more pay and your O.K.
Money it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash…….(Pink Floyd)
Apparently to Hillary Clinton Presidential Campaign
- did not have enough of it.
To think, Hillary with all her clout, with Bill’s clout,
With her being the First Lady for eight years,
(even though she was in a corner,
While Monika played First Mistress, after all Bill was hornier)
The Clintons are worth ten of millions of dollars,
Then why do her campaign aides work for free,
At least one month, are they altruistic or that naïve?
Barack (or some bumbling reporter said his name Barrack, (as in barracks)
I wonder if Gomer Pyle, USMC had something to do with this?)
Raised the bar by getting huge endorsements Oprah, Sweet Caroline, (bop-bop-bop) ,
The terminator’s wife and lastly a man,
Senator Ted Kennedy,
By his actions or inactions,
was responsible for the death of Mary Jo Kopekne
(see observation Well Hello Mary Jo)
And Money, three times the amount Hillary raised in January.
Hillary was bound by the recent voter’s laws and laws governing the PAC.
She attempting to beat Obama by outspending him, therefore she will be,
The Leader of the PAC(k) .  She learned it from Ron Reagan vicariously,
Ron Regan led the USA to outspend and out produce the Soviet Union.
That is why there was not shot fired between the NATO and Warsaw Pact troops,
That brought an end to the Cold War which existed for a half century.
But Barack learned as well. He is the underdog,
Like in the last Super Bowl XLII, he is the Giant,
Not from New York,
Ready to close in on Hillary in the last two minutes of the game, the final warning.
His campaign is self-reliant,
he does not ask his workers to work for free,
If the Democrats are smart they should stay with Barack,
Come to think of it I hadn’t heard from Bill in awhile,
it’s not his style,
So his campaign strategy for Hillary backfired,
to belittle an opponent took some guile.

1429,Emotion,MoneyPoemsWorryAboutMoneyPoembyKathleenJessieRaine,"Wearing worry about money like a hair shirt
I lie down in my bed and wrestle with my angel.
My bank-manager could not sanction my continuance for another day
But life itself wakes me each morning, and love
Urges me to give although I have no money
In the bank at this moment, and ought properly
To cease to exist in a world where poverty
Is a shameful and ridiculous offence.
Having no one to advise me, I open the Bible
And shut my eyes and put my finger on a text
And read that the widow with the young son
Must give first to the prophetic genius
From the little there is in the bin of flour and the cruse of oil."
1430,Emotion,MoneyPoemsBecauseOfMoneyPoembyFrancisDuggan,"Because of money people wish on others harm or ill
And because of money people others do injure or kill
And because of money great friendships have come to an end
And money can make you an enemy or make you a friend
To those with the power of money respect we do pay
And money speaks every language some are known to say
And those with the most money great power do command
That is something that is not hard to understand
Those with heaps of money enjoy the good life
The millionaire in his seventies has a twenty two year old wife
With brown hair to her shoulders and lovely to behold
She would not be with him if he were poor and old
But because of his money with him she will stay
Money speaks every language that's life as some say."

Confusedly on camel-coloured sands,
And the mute Arab motionlessly stands,
Like some swart god who never wept or smiled,--
I picked up mummy relics of the wild
(And sea-shells once with clutching baby hands),
And felt a wafture from old Motherlands,
And all the morning wonder of a Child
To find Sphinx-money. So the Beduin calls
Small fossils of the waste. Nay, poet's gold;
'Twill give thee entrance to those rites of old,
When hundred-gated Thebes, with storied walls,
Gleamed o'er her Plain, and vast processions rolled
To Amon-Ra through Karnak's pillared halls."

So, put thy wealth in use for mankind's sake;
Let progress come for fellowmen, faster;
What profits come if genuine, thou may take.
The money-needs of life on earth are small;
Money begets money and vices too;
But money cannot solve our problems all;
Let  money  not cause mis- conduct in you.
What use is money kept as coins and notes?
Banks lend their money so that they may grow;
Money cannot purchase all honest votes;
For money's sake, hardships, we undergo.
How many pairs of shoes, your feet will need?
Let excess money try to others feed."

Money is what we spend all our lives spending.

And money is always involved where corruption abound
And corruption and human greed to each other live nearby
And why some people are corrupt this could be the answer why
Some will tell you that money is their nearest and dearest friend
And it is because of money that many friendships are known to end
And many with lots of money seem to have a crave for more
This year they have made two million in profit next year they aim for four
The lust for paper currency to everyone does  not apply
But that money speaks every language is something that none can deny
Those with it are looked up to and those without it on are looked down
And who would wish for to be known as the pauper of the town
'Tis the lust for money that leads to corruption through greed
And those with plenty of it looked up to as those who in life succeed."
1436,Emotion,MoneyPoemsMoneyTimesPoembyJOEPOEWHIT,"A paragraph from a book by - Washington Irving - The History of New York - about the fortunes of money, that I am presently reading. I hope it will share some wisdom.
' If we could get a peep at the tally of dame fortune, where, like a notable landlady, she regularly chalks up the debtor and creditor accounts of mankind, we should find that, upon the whole, good and evil are pretty nearly balanced in this world; and that though we may for a long while revel in the very lap pf prosperity, the time will at length come, when we must pay off the reckoning. Fortune, in fact, is a pestilent shrew, and withal a most inexorable creditor; for though she may indulge her favourites in long credits, and overwhelm them with her favours; yet sooner or later, she brings up her arrears, with the rigour of an experienced publican, and washes out her scores with their tears. 'SINCE', says good old Boetius in his consolations of philosophy, 'since no man can retain her at his pleasure, and since her flight is so deeply lamented, what are her favours but sure prognostications of approaching trouble and calamity.'

To nothing shy of the current most recent figures for poverty
Lord help me pay my bills, that's what I said this morning

Continued to shrink and shrink and shrink
Lord help me pay my bills, it's what I'm thinking now
Taking the cow to the market and trading it for magic beans
The truck's tires are worn thin like the financial state I'm in
And the beans that I get for the cow probably won't sprout into a stalk
Tall enough and strong enough to reach Heaven's door
Because with all my problems and yours.....

Money can't really be that way,
To say money is evil surely can't be true,
Isn't it something that we all love to use,

What is money?
They say
Money makes the world go around
And people crazy and unsound
It's nothing and everything as well
Full of wonders and full of fools
Makes all endlessly ponder and droll
Some have too much and some less
A dollar or a dime, our lives they rule
And it's true and it's true
Yet there goes a saying, that's also true
That money saved is money earned
The wisdom that carries truth and mind
It's a thing to be frugal
Being thrifty, prudent and economical
Not to be misunderstood with being parsimonious
That carries attitude miserly or ungenerous
Frugal are those
That suppresses instant gratification
Thereby making themselves efficient and wise
At the core of the principle lies
The wisdom of using less or storing what remains
And not even wasting anything less
Or else, to quote Confucius
'He who will not economize will have to agonize'
This is true for both individuals and businesses"

We watch in awe as thier money pile up
which is fine, but then their problems are
larger than ours
The red carpet they proudly walk, of foriegn
places they smoothly talk, exotic as it seems
it's only thier dreams, we have them too maybe
in a strange way, they have already come true
Anyone not in a designer's dress will surley
be described as a hot mess, The men dress in
the best, thier main objective is to impress
How can one be happy wiithout being wealthy?
good question, well start first with being grateful
for what you have, make yourself happy not so
mad, stop really, and smell some roses, do

Money was blessed by the devil,
Money, money can kill,
Money can cheat, steal…
Ask the disbarred lawyer,
What this sad creature
Can do: It can commit suicide,
Money, money can divide,
Money is not what you think it is,
Having money is not going to put you really at ease,
On the contrary, you’ll have fewer friends,
And more creatures showing their hands,
Claws, guns and deadly weapons.
Money will not send you to the heavens,
Money, money is dirty and evil;
Money is a sick devil.
Money and women don’t mix,
Just like alcohol and driving.
Having hush money is not a quick fix,
But a dangerous way to go down the ravine.
Money is not what you think it is,
Having money is not going to put you really at ease.
Money exists to be spent:
To buy food, clothes, and to pay the rent.
Be careful with money,
Money is not a faithful honey."

He ran and knelt down on the side walk
The beggar
In front of the rich man who got out of his
Mercedes car
With his rough voice he begged money
For cigar
Proudly the man threw him
Some cash
On which the beggar walked on his knees
With a rush
Got the money and ran to a shop
In a flash
Bought a cigar, lit it and started to turn it
Into ash
He inhaled deep and smiled like
A star

1452,Emotion,MoneyPoemsMoneyAndMePoembyMarkRSlaughter,"Money and me, we’re such a team
Money and me, inseparable we
Money and me, together we dream
Money and me, in harmony
Money and me, such synergy
Money and me, so much in love
Money and me, a power to be
Money and me, we’re hand in glove.

1453,Emotion,MoneyPoemsMoneyAbusedPoembyIndiraRenganathan,"Mind set
All to make money
Shut heart and soul
Banging on
Made money sequenced
Bribes and bribed
Sedately wet
Vamped, smoked, drugged
To racing
On blackened therapy of escapism
Path of confession opens
Walk in to treat
The heart and soul"
1454,Emotion,MoneyPoemsTheWoodmanAndTheMoneyHunterPoembyGeorgeMosesHorton,"Throughout our rambles much we find;
The bee trees burst with honey;
Wild birds we tame of every kind,
At once they seem to be resign'd;
I know but one that lags behind,
There's nothing lags but money.
The woods afford us much supply,
The opossum, coon, and coney;
They all are tame and venture nigh,
Regardless of the public eye,
I know but one among them shy,
There's nothing shy but money.
And she lies in the bankrupt shade;
The cunning fox is funny;
When thus the public debts are paid,
Deceitful cash is not afraid,
Where funds are hid for private trade,
There's nothing paid but money.
Then let us roam the woods along,
And drive the coon and coney;
Our lead is good, our powder strong,
To shoot the pigeons as they throng,
But sing no more the idle song,
Nor prowl the chase for money."
1455,Emotion,MoneyPoemsSonnetMoneyIsnTTheSolutionPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"What's the formula for success in life?
Hard-work- this answer, everyone agrees;
How to avoid ensuing problems, strife?
Alas! most people choose money with ease.
Money is not the problem-solver right;
Money is needed to some extent, yet;
Money in excess makes a man lose sight!
Money brings evils in its wake, I bet!
Life's challenges are something, we must face;
We cannot put the cart  before the horse!
Hard-labour and honesty are life's base;
Short-cuts to success, God will ne'er endorse.
But why do people run after money?
Like bees, you gather nectar, make honey!"
1456,Emotion,MoneyPoemsMoneyPoembyDavidHarris,"We walk down many avenues,
and along many streets,
unfortunately none are paved with gold.
We have to make our own riches,
for when we do we appreciate them more.
If we were given wealth untold,
we would not appreciate it.
Better to earn our money,
we then appreciate it more.
Money can buy many things,
with that I will agree,
but money cannot buy everything,
and those word are also true.
It cannot buy the respect,
from our fellow man,
that has to be earnt too.
It cannot buy lasting love,
as that comes once,
only in our lifetime.
Nor can it buy happiness
that can only come from within us.
Money can buy material things,
clothes and food as such.
But it can ever buy
those most precious things
that we all hold so dear.
It will never buy,
another’s warm and loving soul,
who will be beside us,
throughout of lasting days.

1458,Emotion,MoneyPoemsPowerConferredByMoneyPoembyJuliusBabarinsa,"It is a fact that human beings cannot live without money
People go to work everyday because of money
The more money we have the greater the influence
The more influence we have the greater the control
The more control we have the greater the power
Therefore with lots of money, we acquire power
We classify some people as rich, affluent and prosperous
This is because they have lots and lots of money
By the way - what is this power conferred by money?
In other words - how powerful is money?
Several people agree that money is everything
Lack of money can lead to divorce
Labour unions will go on strike for money
Political campaign is doomed without money
Businesses close down when they have no money
Consultants sell their services for money
Without money we cannot acquire any property
In some countries, access to superior medical services
Is not possible if you do not have lots of money
Also in a number of societies, the caliber of education
You can have depends on how wealthy your parents are
To have money power is to have authority
Oh! Money, what are we going to do without you?
Many believe that money talks everywhere
Whoever has more money makes the loudest noise
The power conferred by money turn few people
To be labeled as the movers and shakers
Does this mean that the poor have less power?
Take a closer look at the society in general
The answer is everywhere and in all places"

1460,Emotion,MoneyPoems985WhatMoneyCantBuyPoembyMelvinaGermain,"You look good and you know it too
Why no one is as pretty as you
You bought yourself a new car,
Fancy clothes, going to the bar.
High heel shoes, elegant jewels
Ready to party, no hard rules
You think you’re full of class
Your money says it’s so
Always on the go, spending that money
Well just remember this honey
Money can’t buy you class, happiness or respect
Not knowing what you’re doing, be careful what you get."
1461,Emotion,MoneyPoemsmoneyPoembyEmmaAlberts,"Putting money in the bank
Feeding the pig
He eats it with joy
And does a cute jig
Money grows on trees
That won't come true
Spending too much
But you don't have a clue
Earning it back
One coin at a time
Unclogging drains
And fences, I must climb
(*yawn* Winter 2008, Age 11, Door County, Wisconsin)

1462,Emotion,MoneyPoemsTheViolentSpaceOrWhenYourSisterSleepsAroundForMoneyPoembyEtheridgeKnight,"Exchange in greed the ungraceful signs. Thrust
The thick notes between green apple breasts.
Then the shadow of the devil descends,
The violent space cries and angel eyes,
Large and dark, retreat in innocence and in ice.
(Run sister run—the Bugga man comes!)
The violent space cries silently,
Like you cried wide years ago
In another space, speckled by the sun
And the leaves of a green plum tree,
And you were stung
By a red wasp and we flew home.
(Run sister run—the Bugga man comes!)
Well, hell, lil sis, wasps still sting.
You are all of seventeen and as alone now
In your pain as you were with the sting
On your brow.
Well, shit. lil sis, here we are:
You and I and this poem.
And what should I do? should I squat
In the dust and make strange markings on the ground?
Shall I chant a spell to drive the demon away?
(Run sister run—the Bugga man comes!)
In the beginning you were the Virgin Mary,
And you are the Virgin Mary now.
But somewhere between Nazareth and Bethlehem
You lost your name in the nameless void.
'O Mary don't you weep don't you moan'
O Mary shake your butt to the violent juke,
Absord the demon puke and watch the whites eyes pop,
(Run sister run—the Bugga man comes!)
And what do I do. I boil my tears in a twisted spoon
And dance like an angel on the point of a needle.
I sit counting syllables like Midas gold.
I am not bold. I cannot yet take hold of the demon
And lift his weight from you black belly,
So I grab the air and sing my song.
(But the air cannot stand my singing long.)"
1463,Emotion,MoneyPoemsMoneyMoneyMoneyPoemPoembyDaveTanguay,"Money! money! money! “who”, needs money?
Yeah right, - ask me another question honey-
From day one, - money rules our lives.
How much we are worth, is how well we survive.
If we are born to wealth, clout, and prominence
We can be assured; the people will acknowledge our
Dominance.
However if it so happens we are born poor, we only have dreams.
Dreams to be, - to be on top of the - so-called - social hierarchy
Yes through our lives, we dream the UN - dream - able
Our dreams may even cause our minds to become unstable
Whose idea was it to initiate such a craze as money anyhow?
It sure wasn’t the Indians, for they greeted us with the word, -
“How! ”
If it were up to me, I’d rob Fort Knox, and dump the goal in
The middle of the ocean.
Without a core value for money, this would start quite a commotion
Who knows it may even be the beginning of a brand new day.
For to give, share, serve, love, - would be given every which way

1464,Emotion,MoneyPoemsOnAHandfulOfFrenchMoneyPoembyDanteGabrielRossetti,"These coins that jostle on my hand do own
No single image: each name here and date
Denoting in man's consciousness and state
New change. In some, the face is clearly known,—
In others marred. The badge of that old throne
Of Kings is on the obverse; or this sign
Which says, “I France am all—lo, I am mine!”
Or else the Eagle that dared soar alone.
Even as these coins, so are these lives and years
Mixed and bewildered; yet hath each of them
No less its part in what is come to be
For France. Empire, Republic, Monarchy,—
Each clamours or keeps silence in her name,
And lives within the pulse that now is hers."
1465,Emotion,MoneyPoemsMoneyPoembyBernadetteMariaThompson,"Money is survival
Money is nice
to have
but if your not
careful it can
become your God
without you realizing
money is loaned
to us, just has
your life is
loaned."
1466,Emotion,MoneyPoemsPowerAndMoneyPoembyFrancisDuggan,"A bad habit they form as a young girl or boy
To have power over others some people enjoy
With personal power some are not satisfied
Their desire for top job they don't try for to hide
They need more than personal power to be seen to succeed
It is all about money and all about greed
One might say they do have big egos to feed
The more money they have the more they seem to need
Power and money are siblings it does seem that way
And money speaks every language some are known to say
The non greedy and non power hungry people one has to admire
The lust for large sums of money or power over others they never desire
They are not the type for to put others down
Or wish to be known as the best in the town."
1467,Emotion,MoneyPoemsMoneyYouCanTTakeWithYouWhenYouDiePoembyAldoKraas,"Money you can't take with you when you die
So before you die I hope you decide
To whom you are going to live your money to
I hope that you are not going to spend all
That money on yourself"
1468,Emotion,MoneyPoemsSonnetMoneyBuysSinfulThingsPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"Money can get a person murdered but
It can’t ev’r bring back life that has once left;
Money can build a palace from a hut!
It can’t give widows, husbands, love bereft.
Money can give love-making hours and lust;
It cannot wipe the sin of adultery;
Money can make idols that go to dust,
But can’t wipe tears, stop wars, crimes, misery.
Money can make a man tell false witness;
It cannot stifle justice of our God;
Money can buy a harem to Caress,
But not the Word of God who is the Lord!
Money can buy most things on earth but ne’er
A place in Heaven, the least however!"
1469,Emotion,MoneyPoemsMoneyPoembyGreenPeace,"Money can buy costumes but not beauty
Money can buy idols but not devotion
Money can buy books but not wisdom and knowledge
Money can buy bed but not rest and sleep
Money can buy medicines but not health
Money can buy wealth but not health
Money can buy clothes but not shame
Money can buy food but not hunger
Money can buy flowers but not freshness and fragrance
Money can buy land but not home (made of human hearts)
Money can buy honey but not sweetness
Money can buy somethings but not everything
Money can buy luxuries but not happiness."

1471,Emotion,MoneyPoemsButItMakesMeLotsOfMoneyPoembyAlessandraLiverani,"Cigarette addiction kills people
But it makes me lots of money
It ruins their health
But it makes me lots of money
They cannot breathe properly
But it makes me lots of money
Their addiction causes them misery
But it makes me lots of money
A trillion cigarette butts pollute our earth daily
But it makes me lots of money
Cigarettes cause fires which burn many people to death
But it makes me lots of money
Parents buy cigarettes when their children need to eat
But it makes me lots of money
Cigarette smoke fills our bars and nightclubs, very unpleasant
But it makes me lots of money
Dirty ashtrays are disgusting
But it makes me lots of money
Why are you allowed to promote and sell such a disgusting product?
Because I've got lots of money
(Sydney, Australia - 2003)"
1472,Emotion,MoneyPoemsAMoneyAddictionPoembyRameshTA,"With increasing needs thoughts of money have increased
And man is left in the world to live only for money forever!
It is not possible to drink, eat and live without money here;
Money thirst for everything has made man addict of money!
Taxation, price rise and mismanagement tighten one’s belt
National financial crisis coupled with world economic woes
Due to international crude oil price hike add fuel to fire ever!
Protectionism and subsidies of advanced nations strike world.
Wars and terrorist activities worsened all to face world recession;
Gold price hike and oil price hike have created turmoil unbearable!
For want of funds everyone indulges in short cut routes to riches;
There is no chance of recovery from addiction to money anymore!
Lottery, gambling, horse race and lotto many people go for
To earn fast buck so as to satisfy money hunger some how!
Betting on boxing, wrestling, cricket, general elections go on
And indirectly many accrue black money to meet their needs!
All black monies big shots deposit in Swiss bank to use abroad
By way of making exports using under invoices for many goods!
All due to bad policies of govts. and corrupt practices everywhere
Dark acts perpetrate black economy propelled by this addiction!"
1473,Emotion,MoneyPoemsNoMoneyPoembyAshleyJensen,"no money to do anything with
its hard enough to get by
with out some riche kid walking by
they flant their three credit cards in your face
plus their 2005 mitibushi eclipse
yet they complain that they have no money
but yet their dad has another car for them
it all makes no sense when we people must
suffer and yet survive with little money but
the other half lives in riches
if some one is in help they will not help unless it
is there friend who actually doesnt need help
but for them who really cares
no money for us only those who can afford it but
no one notices us because we try to blend in anyway"

1476,Emotion,MoneyPoemsAllAboutMoneyPoembySamanyanLakshminarayanan,"nothing comes free..here
everything is tagged
excepting life...strange
life given to us not tagged
the days and nights given
are not tagged even
even then....
day in and day out
i am all out
searching ways and means
to make my money...
i do not pay any money
for the sun and breeze
god in nature an absolute giver
praying for wealth and prosperity
praying for money...money..and more money...to god
i feel will get us not even a penny
GOD DOES NOT KNOW OUR MONEY
when you send your kid on a trip away
you will give him money to spend on the way
we were sent here without a penny
when i return as dead stock one day
worldly wise kith and kin of my
send me with a penny on my forehead
just a penny?
is that what i was worth...or
is that the way fare to hell or heaven
just a penny?"
1477,Emotion,MoneyPoemsMoneyPoembyFrancisDuggan,"In the Human World money speaks every language some say
And all things have a price on them 'twould seem that way
And though the reaper will one day claim the lives of you and I
It costs money to live and it costs money to die.
The beautiful young woman for a partner has an old billionaire
That he is useless in bed she does not seem to care
He believes her when she tells him she loves him but for his money she lie
Since she will be very wealthy when he die.
So very restricted by their poverty
The working poor cannot take their wives out to tea
To provide for their families on a small wage they get by
But a good sort of life style they don't have to enjoy.
Lack of money may lead to a good appetite
But do not expect to live to an old age on a very poor diet
The old sugar daddy is enjoying the good life
With his twenty four years old blond good looking wife."
1478,Emotion,MoneyPoemsWeAinTGotNoMoneyHoneyButWeGotRainPoembyCharlesBukowski,"call it the greenhouse effect or whatever
but it just doesn't rain like it used to.
I particularly remember the rains of the
depression era.
there wasn't any money but there was
plenty of rain.
it wouldn't rain for just a night or
a day,
it would RAIN for 7 days and 7
nights
and in Los Angeles the storm drains
weren't built to carry off taht much
water
and the rain came down THICK and
MEAN and
STEADY
and you HEARD it banging against
the roofs and into the ground
waterfalls of it came down
from roofs
and there was HAIL
big ROCKS OF ICE
bombing
exploding smashing into things
and the rain
just wouldn't
STOP
and all the roofs leaked-
dishpans,
cooking pots
were placed all about;
they dripped loudly
and had to be emptied
again and
again.
the rain came up over the street curbings,
across the lawns, climbed up the steps and
entered the houses.
there were mops and bathroom towels,
and the rain often came up through the
toilets:bubbling, brown, crazy,whirling,
and all the old cars stood in the streets,
cars that had problems starting on a
sunny day,
and the jobless men stood
looking out the windows
at the old machines dying
like living things out there.
the jobless men,
failures in a failing time
were imprisoned in their houses with their
wives and children
and their
pets.
the pets refused to go out
and left their waste in
strange places.
the jobless men went mad
confined with
their once beautiful wives.
there were terrible arguments
as notices of foreclosure
fell into the mailbox.
rain and hail, cans of beans,
bread without butter; fried
eggs, boiled eggs, poached
eggs; peanut butter
sandwiches, and an invisible
chicken in every pot.
my father, never a good man
at best, beat my mother
when it rained
as I threw myself
between them,
the legs, the knees, the
screams
until they
seperated.
'I'll kill you,' I screamed
at him. 'You hit her again
and I'll kill you! '
'Get that son-of-a-bitching
kid out of here! '
'no, Henry, you stay with
your mother! '
all the households were under
seige but I believe that ours
held more terror than the
average.
and at night
as we attempted to sleep
the rains still came down
and it was in bed
in the dark
watching the moon against
the scarred window
so bravely
holding out
most of the rain,
I thought of Noah and the
Ark
and I thought, it has come
again.
we all thought
that.
and then, at once, it would
stop.
and it always seemed to
stop
around 5 or 6 a.m.,
peaceful then,
but not an exact silence
because things continued to
drip
drip
drip
and there was no smog then
and by 8 a.m.
there was a
blazing yellow sunlight,
Van Gogh yellow-
crazy, blinding!
and then
the roof drains
relieved of the rush of
water
began to expand in the warmth:
PANG! PANG! PANG!
and everybody got up and looked outside
and there were all the lawns
still soaked
greener than green will ever
be
and there were birds
on the lawn
CHIRPING like mad,
they hadn't eaten decently
for 7 days and 7 nights
and they were weary of
berries
and
they waited as the worms
rose to the top,
half drowned worms.
the birds plucked them
up
and gobbled them
down; there were
blackbirds and sparrows.
the blackbirds tried to
drive the sparrows off
but the sparrows,
maddened with hunger,
smaller and quicker,
got their
due.
the men stood on their porches
smoking cigarettes,
now knowing
they'd have to go out
there
to look for that job
that probably wasn't
there, to start that car
that probably wouldn't
start.
and the once beautiful
wives
stood in their bathrooms
combing their hair,
applying makeup,
trying to put their world back
together again,
trying to forget that
awful sadness that
gripped them,
wondering what they could
fix for
breakfast.
and on the radio
we were told that
school was now
open.
and
soon
there I was
on the way to school,
massive puddles in the
street,
the sun like a new
world,
my parents back in that
house,
I arrived at my classroom
on time.
Mrs. Sorenson greeted us
with, 'we won't have our
usual recess, the grounds
are too wet.'
'AW! ' most of the boys
went.
'but we are going to do
something special at
recess,' she went on,
'and it will be
fun! '
well, we all wondered
what that would
be
and the two hour wait
seemed a long time
as Mrs.Sorenson
went about
teaching her
lessons.
I looked at the little
girls, they looked so
pretty and clean and
alert,
they sat still and
straight
and their hair was
beautiful
in the California
sunshine.
the the recess bells rang
and we all waited for the
fun.
then Mrs. Sorenson told us:
'now, what we are going to
do is we are going to tell
each other what we did
during the rainstorm!
we'll begin in the front row
and go right around!
now, Michael, you're first! ...'
well, we all began to tell
our stories, Michael began
and it went on and on,
and soon we realized that
we were all lying, not
exactly lying but mostly
lying and some of the boys
began to snicker and some
of the girls began to give
them dirty looks and
Mrs.Sorenson said,
'all right! I demand a
modicum of silence
here!
I am interested in what
you did
during the rainstorm
even if you
aren't! '
so we had to tell our
stories and they were
stories.
one girl said that
when the rainbow first
came
she saw God's face
at the end of it.
only she didn't say which end.
one boy said he stuck
his fishing pole
out the window
and caught a little
fish
and fed it to his
cat.
almost everybody told
a lie.
the truth was just
too awful and
embarassing to tell.
then the bell rang
and recess was
over.
'thank you,' said Mrs.
Sorenson, 'that was very
nice.
and tomorrow the grounds
will be dry
and we will put them
to use
again.'
most of the boys
cheered
and the little girls
sat very straight and
still,
looking so pretty and
clean and
alert,
their hair beautiful in a sunshine that
the world might never see
again.

1479,Emotion,MoneyPoemsTheMoneyTreeChildrenPoembyCJHeck,"I dreamed I grew a money tree
outside in my yard.
My job was to care for it
and I worked very hard.
I saw that it was watered.
It grew so straight and tall
and when the money ripened
I picked it in the fall.
The flowers were green dollar bills,
the seeds inside were coins,
and others grew and glittered
where all the branches joined.
On windy days I stood below
and held a great big bucket.
Other days I climbed right up
to find one ripe and pluck it.
People say that money
doesn't really grow on trees.
I know. I only wish it did
just like in my dreams."
1480,Emotion,MoneyPoemsHaikuMoneyMessPoembyKeneHall,"Financial steps led
Shoes thru the same greedy grease
Man's Blind bluff"
1481,Emotion,MoneyPoemsTheLustForPowerAndMoneyPoembyFrancisDuggan,"The lust for power and money to corruption lead
And some cheat and lie to satisfy their greed
And big Corporations do not have a soul
The avarice that afflicts them their thinking control.
The distribution of wealth as ever seems so unfair
And thousands grow poorer for every new millionaire
Oil tycoons and arms dealers make millions every day
Whilst thousands are dying of hunger like flowers in decay.
To be born of poor parents is their only crime
And they look thin, old and gray though only in their prime
In refugee camps they are forced to reside
In a Land ravaged by drought and by war men destroyed.
'Tis true power can be a corruptible thing
Of the wealthy and famous some poets only sing
Why laud people who have far more than enough
When millions are homeless and have to sleep rough.
The lust for power seems to be thriving of late
And only the wealthy and famous the media celebrate
Whilst each day thousands die of hunger doesn''t life seem unfair
In a World where empathy and compassion are rare."
1482,Emotion,MoneyPoemsManMachineMoneyTimePoembyRameshTA,"Matter is more important than mind or heart
In this money world that rules all mankind!
Machine does more than what man can do
And man is made a servant of machine care!
The time saved by machine work is not used
Well for the betterment of man's world but are
Used for the accumulation of more money only
And man wastes time in gambling for money!
Man has become a slave of machine and money
That make him think and plan for their development
But not for the development of mind and spirit
For which all inventions were made to save time!
Caught among machine, money and time man is mad
Now not knowing how to regain his glorious state again!"
1483,Emotion,MoneyPoemsMoneyPoembyHowardNemerov,"An introductory lecture
This morning we shall spend a few minutes
Upon the study of symbolism, which is basic
To the nature of money. I show you this nickel.
Icons and cryptograms are written all over
The nickel: one side shows a hunchbacked bison
Bending his head and curling his tail to accommodate
The circular nature of money. Over him arches
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, and, squinched in
Between that and his rump, E PLURIBUS UNUM,
A Roman reminiscence that appears to mean
An indeterminately large number of things
All of which are the same. Under the bison
A straight line giving him a ground to stand on
Reads FIVE CENTS. And on the other side of our nickel
There is the profile of a man with long hair
And a couple of feathers in the hair; we know
Somehow that he is an American Indian, and
He wears the number nineteen-thirty-six.
Right in front of his eyes the word LIBERTY, bent
To conform with the curve of the rim, appears
To be falling out of the sky Y first; the Indian
Keeps his eyes downcast and does not notice this;
To notice it, indeed, would be shortsighted of him.
So much for the iconography of one of our nickels,
Which is now becoming a rarity and something of
A collectors’ item: for as a matter of fact
There is almost nothing you can buy with a nickel,
The representative American Indian was destroyed
A hundred years or so ago, and his descendants’
Relations with liberty are maintained with reservations,
Or primitive concentration camps; while the bison,
Except for a few examples kept in cages,
Is now extinct. Something like that, I think,
Is what Keats must have meant in his celebrated
Ode on a Grecian Urn.
Notice, in conclusion,
A number of circumstances sometimes overlooked
Even by experts: (a) Indian and bison,
Confined to obverse and reverse of the coin,
Can never see each other; they are looking
In opposite directions, the bison past
The Indian’s feathers, the Indian past
The bison’s tail; (c) they are upside down
To one another; (d) the bison has a human face
Somewhat resembling that of Jupiter Ammon.
I hope that our studies today will have shown you
Something of the import of symbolism
With respect to the understanding of what is symbolized."
1484,Emotion,MoneyPoemsMoneyTreePoembyHerbertNehrlich,"Ten years ago, in Tennessee
I grew myself a money tree.
The money came in all-green leaves
my shepherd kept away the thieves.
My dog supplied his droppings, too
I added, also, chicken poo.
The tree grew big and even bigger
it was a huge imposing figure.
And from the top you could make out
Jack Daniel's place, on Hilltop Route.
I cared for, watered my big tree
it did allow me to be free.
And in the year thereafter it
had little ones, I said 'oh shit'.
Today I have a whole plantation
by far the largest in the nation.
I am the richest in the land
my life is great and never bland.
This shows what honest work can do
I wouldn't think it is for you."
1485,Emotion,MoneyPoemsMoneyForHeavenPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"My belly aches for precious food
my androgens are in the mood,
one foot already in the grave
the other one acts rather brave.
Each calendar does lie a bit
and one has placed me in the shit.
A silver lining in my hair
and shaped I am just like a pear.
So many early warning wrinkles
and endless, unproductive  tinkles,
some clerks now dare to call me dear
a wonder that I still can hear.
I see my cute optometrist
with glassy eyes, inside the mist
and when I pay for groceries
I reach and take the first green peace
out of the wallet, giving gladly,
my sight has sunk to 'rather badly',
it is my cottonpickin head
that wants to keep from being dead.
I pay the charlatan  and quack
to feed me pills and fix my back.
While longing for longevity
I do forget that one small key
has been created for my soul
when God designed it to a role.
But, never one to listen much
I aim to commandeer a touch
of real immortality
all for a lousy service fee.
And when I'm down to my last coin
and angels beckon me to join
I'll have no choice and will not care
and, like a blinded forest hare
I do remain in place and freeze
then give the world a final sneeze.
I think the words above might say
it matters not what we can pay
and that we would be well advised
not to be cut or analysed.
There comes a time when your own number
unlocks the door to endless slumber.
So I shall keep my hard-earned cash
by now it is a hefty stash.
And take it to the Never-Never
a move that labels me as clever.
So, having been on earth a scrooge
the benefits shall be quite huge.
Make-over for the mind and bod
and pay the man, in this case, God."
1486,Emotion,MoneyPoemsMoneyTreePoembyRandyJohnson,"One day a man came to my house with a seed.
I decided to buy it because of my greed.
The man said it would grow into a money tree.
When I told people, they said they're glad they're not as stupid as me.
The tree didn't grow and I cussed and hollered.
That seed cost me ten thousand dollars.
People say that my brain is as small as a pig's.
But a CAT scan showed that it's not even half that big."

1488,Emotion,MoneyPoemsTheStatueMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyMoneyPoembyUdiahwitnesstoYah,"The story's told
Of long ago
About a statue
With a head of gold
And its breast
Did silver shine
And brassness
At lower spine
Now iron did make
The legs so strong
And at its base
Was all made wrong
For it was built
Of miry clay
And reinforced
With iron sway
It stood upon sand
Which did give way
When the base was hit
By a Stone that day
The great image
Built sixty high
Summed three sixes
From its front side
And through it was
Only six wide
It bare the mark
Of beastly pride
But the beast did crumble
And was blown away
Like shaft in the wind
Forever gone to stay
And that Stone hewn
By no man's hand
Became a Mountain
Forever to stand."
1489,Emotion,MoneyPoemsmoneyPoembyLorettaDoyleSmalley,"People think that money is everything.

Most important of all it can't buy true love.
So there for it is not everything."

1491,Emotion,MoneyPoemsForgetTheMoneyAndTheStuffPoembybriefrenderingsJoeFazio,"Long have I lived this life. I have finally come
to the realization, that all the gold in the world,
is not worthy, of one once of love.
Do not vanquish yourself, on the alter
of that which is materialistic or the gathering
of riches.
For in the end, there is not one among us, who
would trade all things of wealth, for yet one
more day of life.
In our final moments, it is love...or the lack of
it, that will define our moments of life and bring
to us...peace.

I remember, I remember
The house where I was born,
The little window where the sun
Came peeping in at morn;
He never came a wink too soon
Nor brought too long a day;
But now, I often wish the night
Had borne my breath away.
I remember, I remember
The roses red and white,
The violets and the lily cups--
Those flowers made of light!
The lilacs where the robin built,
And where my brother set
The laburnum on his birthday,--
The tree is living yet!
I remember, I remember
Where I was used to swing,
And thought the air must rush as fresh
To swallows on the wing;
My spirit flew in feathers then
That is so heavy now,
The summer pools could hardly cool
The fever on my brow.
I remember, I remember
The fir-trees dark and high;
I used to think their slender tops
Were close against the sky:
It was a childish ignorance,
But now 'tis little joy
To know I'm farther off from Heaven
Than when I was a boy."
1493,Emotion,RememberPoemsTryToRememberPoembyDavidHarris,"When you are feeling down,
try to remember all the good things you have had,
and I will bet you,
they are many more than the bad.
We tend to remember only
all the bad things in our lives,
and the good things get stored away
for a rainy day we say.
Now if we remember,
all the good things in our life,
we would not be so unhappy
when the bad things come along.

When we two rowed upon the rock-bound lake?
How the wind-fretted waters blew their spray
About our brows like blossom-falls of May
One memorable day?
Dost thou remember the glad mouth that cried--
""Were it not sweet to die now side by side,
To lie together tangled in the deep
Close as the heart-beat to the heart--so keep
The everlasting sleep?""
Dost thou remember? Ah, such death as this
Had set the seal upon my heart's young bliss!
But, wrenched asunder, severed and apart,
Life knew a deadlier death: the blighting smart
Which only kills the heart."

more than i should
more than you know
you have never strayed far from my mind,
eclipsed between
my waking memory and a smoky dream
i remember you in Sixth Grade,
passing steaming notes to me
during study hall, stealing kisses from me
at recess, making out with me
behind the convent during lunch and
teaching me more about a girl’s body
than a 12-year old boy should know
i remember caressing your
budding pincushion breasts, feeling your
impatient tongue in my mouth, and tracing the curves
of your smooth hips way up
beneath your plaid Catholic skirt
i never forgot the innocence and curiosity
with which we explored each other’s
young bodies for few of my intimate
encounters since have bested those wide-eyed moments
i never forgot you, Christine P.
not with all the drugs and heartbreak did i forget!
the mother of my daughter even
resembles you; my final recollection of you -
the way you looked
before you moved away - with her
short brown hair, velveteen belly and
agile, eager hands
i remember telling you once in a letter
that i wanted to marry you
and that’s when we lost touch...
maybe i’ve ploughed thru each
of my liaisons
searching for you all along
in an attempt to reclaim that
feeling of complete gullibility and virtue
for my love life has left little more
for me to discover
you were indeed my first, Christine
while you did not surrender me your virginity,
you gave me your body to tease and your mouth to enjoy
and i wonder if your first time was as clumsy as mine
was it on your honeymoon cruise or
in the backseat of his beat-up Ford?
did you marry at all or keep your maiden name?
do you remember me as well as
i remember you?
because i wonder, too, if you will
ever find this poem,
hidden amongst the weeds of
other poems to my bygone girlfriends
whose names have scarred over
and faded with time"

It shall never forget thee, all lorn as thou art;
More dear in thy sorrow, thy gloom, and thy showers,
Than the rest of the world in their sunniest hours.
Wert thou all that I wish thee, great, glorious, and free,
First flower of the earth, and first gem of the sea,
I might hail thee with prouder, with happier brow,
But oh! could I love thee more deeply tha now?
No, thy chains as they rankle, thy blood as it runs,
But make thee more painfully dear to thy sons --
Whose hearts, like the young of the desert-bird's nest,
Drink love in each life-drop that flows from thy breast."

So get up because you’re not dead.

Maybe I'll just find another dime

Only remember me; you understand
It will be late to counsel then or pray.

A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,
Better by far you should forget and smile
Than that you should remember and be sad.

Expedition, having seen his vessel crushed by the ice,
undertook a perilous journey through the ice and snow
toward the coast of Siberia. With a part of his command
he finally reached the wilderness near the mouth of the
River Lena. Disabled by sickness, hunger and cold, the
little band was compelled to halt, while two of their
number went forward. When the pathetic parting was over,
and after the two seaman had begun their battle with the
snowdrifts, they heard a call, and on turning, recognized
the voice of one of their officers feebly shouting: ""When
you get to New York, remember me!"" From that group of
brave men, these were the last words that ever reached
human ears.
Starving beside the frozen Lena!
Perishing in a snow blockade!
From a lone group of shipwrecked seamen
Two are sent forth to seek for aid.
'Tis a sad, a solemn parting;
Life or death! who can foresee?
Hark! on the wind floats this last message:
""When you get home, remember me!""
Gallant and brave! together clinging,
True to the last! with but this plea;
Still in our ears its words are ringing,
""When you get home, remember me!""
Ready to sink, yet persevering,
Southward and helpward toil the twain;
Close in the rear an Artic winter
Binding the land with icy chain.
Weary wait the suff'ring comrades;
Help they ask on bended knee;
But to their friends come these words only:
""When you get home, remember me!""
Succor at last! the twain find helpers;
Shrieks the fierce gale, ""Too late! too late!""
Valiant De Long and brave companions,
Manfully, calmly meet their fate.
One by one, they lie down dying;
All obey that stern decree---
Last on their lips this plaintive whisper:
""When you get home, remember me!""
Starving beside the frozen Lena!
Perishing in a snow blockade!
Had we but known their need, what thousands
Would have rejoiced to render aid!
There was want, while here abundance;
Naught had they, while plenty we.
Shall we not heed their last entreaty:
""When you get home, remember me!"""

1513,Emotion,RememberPoemsPoemRememberMidsummerTheFragranceOfBoxPoembyDelmoreSchwartz,"Remember midsummer: the fragrance of box, of white
roses
And of phlox. And upon a honeysuckle branch
Three snails hanging with infinite delicacy
-- Clinging like tendril, flake and thread, as self-tormented
And self-delighted as any ballerina,
just as in the orchard,
Near the apple trees, in the over-grown grasses
Drunken wasps clung to over-ripe pears
Which had fallen: swollen and disfigured.
For now it is wholly autumn: in the late
Afternoon as I walked toward the ridge where the hills
begin,
There is a whir, a thrashing in the bush, and a startled
pheasant, flying out and up,
Suddenly astonished me, breaking the waking dream.
Last night
Snatches of sleep, streaked by dreams and half dreams
- So that, aloft in the dim sky, for almost an hour,
A sausage balloon - chalk-white and lifeless looking--
floated motionless
Until, at midnight, I went to New Bedlam and saw what I
feared
the most - I heard nothing, but it
had all happened several times elsewhere.
Now, in the cold glittering morning, shining at the
window,
The pears hang, yellowed and over-ripe, sodden brown in
erratic places, all bunched and dangling,
Like a small choir of bagpipes, silent and waiting. And I
rise now,
Go to the window and gaze at the fallen or falling country
-- And see! -- the fields are pencilled light brown
or are the dark brownness of the last autumn
-- So much has shrunken to straight brown lines, thin as
the
bare thin trees,
Save where the cornstalks, white bones of the lost forever dead,
Shrivelled and fallen, but shrill-voiced when the wind
whistles,
Are scattered like the long abandoned hopes and ambitions
Of an adolescence which, for a very long time, has been
merely
A recurrent target and taunt of the inescapable mockery of
memory."

Whenever I am in the mood
I remember my childhood
With the bad and the good
I remember my childhood
With the variety of available junk food
Funny, the old want to be young
While kids endeavour to be old and strong
Girls wanted to grow up fast as women
Boys wanted to grow up fast as men
Before they could walk right or learn
Those were good times
With very little crime
We had fun with little a dime
How is that for a rhyme?
Mum would call us for biscuits and cakes
While we played games and learnt from mistakes
We all went anxiously to school
To see what best pranks any of us could pull
I remember my childhood
I was always polite and not rude
I remember my childhood
If I could then you should
We as kids all had dreams
Which we shared as a team
We all loved to rock but hated homework
I mean what was the point of so much paperwork
And what is really bizarre
Is that I was always after
The bedtime stories from Mama and Papa
I also enjoyed the view of the nightly stars from afar
Same way I loved presents at Christmas and Easter
Mama always used to say
A gift no matter how little will lift anyone's spirit any day
I remember my childhood
And the adventures in the woods
I remember my childhood
With all the includes and excludes
I remember my childhood
And till today there are still things I've never understood

A first kiss,
A lost love.
I guess we owe them thanks,
I guess we do.
Thanks for the memories,
How sweet they are."
1517,Emotion,RememberPoemsIRememberPoembyDaunaLeeMartens,"I remember going to your house,
Staying up till the early hours of morning
I remember shaving our legs together,
And putting on lotion;
I remember when we went to Winnipeg just a few weeks ago,
And tried on the really good-smelling perfume
I remember going to the park together,
Sometimes at lunch, sometimes after school
I remember “doing our homework”,
When really we just wanted to be together
I remember the first time you took me to your youth,
And saturate,
And our much fun we had
I remember having sleepovers,
How I would always fall asleep before you
I remember just this past year when,
For Christmas, you gave me love and reindeer socks
I remember writing notes to each other,
In class,
Sometimes getting caught, most often not
I remember using this type of font to do our E.L.A homework,
Of course waiting till the last minute
I remember your hugs and how you were most often there,
Even when I acted like a bear
I remember us being annoyed at each other a lot,
But we always made up the next day
I remember how cheesy this poem may be,
But I just wanted to say,
I love you **, and I will remember you till we meet again

1518,Emotion,RememberPoemsIRememberYouPoembyshreyakoppaka,"Early in the morning when the birds sings,
Light to this world the sun brings,
When the dew drops like pearls shine,
I remember you in this heart of mine.
When the sky is covered with blanket of clouds,
The lightning strikes and the thunder goes loud,
When the whole world drenches in rain time,
I remember you in this heart of mine.
When flowers bloom in spring season,
And smiles break out for no reason,
For romance when the weather is fine,
I remember you in this heart of mine.
In winter when the snow is all around,
And fog comes out of mouths instead of sound,
Looking at the cones of bare pine,
I remember you in this heart of mine.
When the ground is full of dried leaves in fall,
Of different colours from trees so tall,
Watching those ants busy working in a line,
I remember you in this heart of mine.
The time when love is in the air,
And roses and chocolates are everywhere,
The day of love, the day of valentine,
I remember you in this heart of mine.
In the cozy full moon night,
When cool breeze sends up chill of delight,
Tapping on the bench by my side,
I remember you in this heart of mine.
With bare feet I walk on the grass wet,
And relive the day we first met,
While listening to music with note divine,
I remember you in this heart of mine…"
1519,Emotion,RememberPoemsYouRememberEllenPoembyThomasMoore,"You remember Ellen, our hamlet's pride,
How meekly she bless'd her humble lot,
When the stranger, William, had made her his bride,
And love was the light of their lowly cot.
Together they toil'd through winds and rains,
Till William, at length, in sadness said,
""We must seek our fortune on other plains;"" --
Then, sighing, she left her lowly shed.
They roam'd a long and a weary way,
Nor much was the maiden's heart at ease,
When now, at close of one stormy day,
They see a proud castle among the trees.
""To-night,"" said the youth, ""we'll shelter there;
The wind blows cold, the hour is late;""
So he blew the horn with a chieftain's air,
And the porter bow'd, as they passd the gate.
""Now, welcome, Lady,"" exclaim'd the youth, --
""This castle is thine, and these dark woods all!""
She believed him crazed, but his words were truth,
For Ellen is Lady of Rosna Hall!
And dearly the Lord of Rosna loves
What William the stranger woo'd and wed;
And the light of bliss, in these lordly groves,
Shines pure as it did in the lowly shed."
1520,Emotion,RememberPoemsRememberHimWhomPassionsPowerPoembyGeorgeGordonByron,"Remember him, whom Passion's power
Severely---deeply---vainly proved:
Remember thou that dangerous hour,
When neither fell, though both were loved.
That yielding breast, that melting eye,
Too much invited to be blessed:
That gentle prayer, that pleading sigh,
The wilder wish reproved, repressed.
Oh! let me feel that all I lost
But saved thee all that Conscience fears;
And blush for every pang it cost
To spare the vain remorse of years.
Yet think of this when many a tongue,
Whose busy accents whisper blame,
Would do the heart that loved thee wrong,
And brand a nearly blighted name.
Think that, whate'er to others, thou
Hast seen each selfish thought subdued:
I bless thy purer soul even now,
Even now, in midnight solitude.
Oh, God! that we had met in time,
Our hearts as fond, thy hand more free;
When thou hadst loved without a crime,
And I been less unworthy thee!
Far may thy days, as heretofore,
From this our gaudy world be past!
And that too bitter moment o'er,
Oh! may such trial be thy last.
This heart, alas! perverted long,
Itself destroyed might there destroy;
To meet thee in the glittering throng,
Would wake Presumption's hope of joy.
Then to the things whose bliss or woe,
Like mine, is wild and worthless all,
That world resign---such scenes forego,
Where those who feel must surely fall.
Thy youth, thy charms, thy tenderness---
Thy soul from long seclusion pure;
From what even here hath passed, may guess
What there thy bosom must endure.
Oh! pardon that imploring tear,
Since not by Virtue shed in vain,
My frenzy drew from eyes so dear;
For me they shall not weep again.
Though long and mournful must it be,
The thought that we no more may meet;
Yet I deserve the stern decree,
And almost deem the sentence sweet.
Still---had I loved thee less---my heart
Had then less sacrificed to thine;
It felt not half so much to part
As if its guilt had made thee mine."
1521,Emotion,RememberPoemsTryToRememberSomeDetailsPoembyYehudaAmichai,"Try to remember some details. Remember the clothing
of the one you love
so that on the day of loss you'll be able to say: last seen
wearing such-and-such, brown jacket, white hat.
Try to remember some details. For they have no face
and their soul is hidden and their crying
is the same as their laughter,
and their silence and their shouting rise to one height
and their body temperature is between 98 and 104 degrees
and they have no life outside this narrow space
and they have no graven image, no likeness, no memory
and they have paper cups on the day of their rejoicing
and paper cups that are used once only.
Try to remember some details. For the world
is filled with people who were torn from their sleep
with no one to mend the tear,
and unlike wild beasts they live
each in his lonely hiding place and they die
together on battlefields
and in hospitals.
And the earth will swallow all of them,
good and evil together, like the followers of Korah,
all of them in thir rebellion against death,
their mouths open till the last moment,
praising and cursing in a single
howl. Try, try
to remember some details."

Gone far away into the silent land;
When you can no more hold me by the hand,
Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.
Remember me when no more day by day
You tell me of our future that you plann'd:
Only remember me; you understand
It will be late to counsel then or pray.
Yet if you should forget me for a while
And afterwards remember, do not grieve:
For if the darkness and corruption leave
A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,
Better by far you should forget and smile
Than that you should remember and be sad."

As we sat side by side,
How you told me that you loved me,
Asked me to be your bride.
And you told me we'd be happy,
Through all the years to come,
If we ever would prove faithful,
As in the days when we were young.
Oh! how well do I remember,
The kind and loving words,
And now as I sat dreaming,
The thoughts my memory stirs.
But the days have passed before me,
And the scenes of long ago,
But I can never forget the
Days that have passed o'er.
Oh! how clearly I remember
The days when we were young,
How we would tell to each other
Of happy times to come,
And as we would sit together,
That dear loved one and I,
Oh, sat dreaming of the future,
And childhood days gone by.
Dearest love, do you remember
The first time that we met --
Our youthful days have gone, love,
I hope you love me yet,
Now we are growing old, love,
Our heads will soon be gray,
May we ever love each other
Till from earth we pass away."

And prying stars scatter in multitude.

The beginners have no alternative in this low waged tragedy
And they grab the oldest profession.

And it seems the each performer gets entr'acte of this chain reaction.

An old man of seventy-three
I lay with my young bride in my arms,

I do not think it has ever happened,
Oh my bride, my bride."
1532,Emotion,RememberPoemsRememberPoembyDavidHarris,"I hear the sound of distant guns,
as good lives march away,
to foreign lands to fight and die,
to preserve the rights of freedom,
for those in that distant land,
can have the right to live,
and not under a tyrant’s hand.
They go not as heroes for glory,
but to help innocent souls,
so they can sleep securely at night.
However, the battlefield where they are,
hold allsorts of dangers there,
some will never return safely home.
Their souls will look over
the battlefield where they fell,
possibly wondering at
the folly of it all.
Therefore, the next time you look at,
a monument with columns of names,
remember that their sacrifice
was made not for one, but for all."
1533,Emotion,RememberPoemsIDontRememberTheWordIWishedToSayPoembyOsipEmilevichMandelstam,"I don’t remember the word I wished to say.
The blind swallow returns to the hall of shadow,
on shorn wings, with the translucent ones to play.
The song of night is sung without memory, though.
No birds. No blossoms on the dried flowers.
The manes of night’s horses are translucent.
An empty boat drifts on the naked river.
Lost among grasshoppers the word’s quiescent.
It swells slowly like a shrine, or a canvas sheet,
hurling itself down, mad, like Antigone,
or falls, now, a dead swallow at our feet.
with a twig of greenness, and a Stygian sympathy.
O, to bring back the diffidence of the intuitive caress,
and the full delight of recognition.
I am so fearful of the sobs of The Muses,
the mist, the bell-sounds, perdition.
Mortal creatures can love and recognise: sound may
pour out, for them, through their fingers, and overflow:
I don’t remember the word I wished to say,
and a fleshless thought returns to the house of shadow.
The translucent one speaks in another guise,
always the swallow, dear one, Antigone....
on the lips the burning of black ice,
and Stygian sounds in the memory."

The one who set your feelings free

You threw away your careless ways
And lost your heart to me....................
Do you not relive those nights
Of wild abandon - timeless flights
Into a magic place...............................
Where I was all you needed then

In quiet times I hope you know

Ere her faithless sons betray'd her;
When Malachi wore the collar of gold,
Which he won from her proud invader,
When her kings, with standard of green unfurl'd,
Led the Red-Branch Knights to danger!
Ere the emerald gem of the western world
Was set in the crown of a stranger.
On Lough Neagh's bank as the fisherman strays,
When the clear cold eve's declining,
He sees the round towers of other days
In the wave beneath him shining:
Thus shall memory often, in dreams sublime,
Catch a glimpse of the days that are over;
Thus, sighing, look through the waves of time,
For the long-faded glories they cover."

1538,Emotion,RememberPoemsRememberWhenPoembyKristinNicoleRothDavis,"Remember when we would give our hearts to everyone and everything
When life was change and we accepted what life would bring
When the seasons would represent their purpose
When it was okay to be so child-like in the spring!
Remember when life stood still in moments of making memories
When families would gather together and share stories
When time would stand still, so it seemed just to recognize LOVE
When people weren’t ashamed of having values
When the children were allowed and encouraged to speak to the Man Above!
Life has changed and the purpose deliberately been rearranged
Presidents of this country acting like a pig that’s been deranged
People don’t even live by the same standards anymore
Strutting their attitudes and making waves with their community
Pushing and shoving and telling the children to keep score!
Remember when people would help others
When daughters looked up to their mothers
When people would lend out a helping hand
When people knew there were hard times, but didn’t complain
When things were tough people came together
When we would give our hearts another chance to start
There was hope in the eyes of the people because we never gave up
The value of the dollar was better than now
Even though very few made much
There wasn’t all this fuss over war and such
Our lives as people connected and we weren’t scared to touch lives
Nowadays, the definition in the word “surprise”
Has also changed, for nowadays, it doesn’t necessarily mean good
My eyes hurt from all these tears,
I wonder are we ever going to make things right, am I understood?
Remember when there was joy in the homes of families
When we seen someone out of change at the counter we would help out
When families were in dire need of food and shelter
When we would encourage our children to not judge when things weren’t kelter
When we stuck together even back in times of the depression
When people’s word counted for something special
I can’t help but wonder if our children will Remember When?
Due to the way things are compared to back then
Makes me quite scared
Are our lives going to be spared?
Will our hearts voice be shared?
When it’s all said and done
I am as proud as anyone
I pray with all my heart’s intent
That you fully understand the power and meaning
And seek one another’s contentment!"

With which battles were fought
But the names of the fallen
Are all but forgot.

Who fought wars large and small
Paying dearly with their lives

The house where I was born;
The rent was thirty-two a month,
Which made my father mourn.
He said he could remember when
His father paid the rent;
And when a man's expenses did
Not take his every cent.
I remember, I remember--
My mother telling my cousin
That eggs had gone to twenty-six
Or seven cents a dozen;
And how she told my father that
She didn't like to speak
Of things like that, but Bridget now
Demanded four a week.
I remember, I remember--
And with a mirthless laugh--
My weekly board at college took
A jump to three and a half.
I bought an eighteen-dollar suit,
And father told me, ""Sonny,
I'll pay the bill this time, but, Oh,
I am not made out of money!""
I remember, I remember,
When I was young and brave
And I declared, ""Well, Birdie, we
Shall now begin to save.""

But now 'tis little joy
To know I'm farther off from wealth
Than when I was a boy."

1553,Emotion,RememberPoemsIHardlyRememberPoembyRafaelGuillén,"I hardly remember your voice, but the pain of you
floats in some remote current of my blood.
I carry you in my depths, trapped in the sludge
like one of those corpses the sea refuses to give up.
It was a spoiled remnant of the South. A beach
without fishing boats, where the sun was for sale.
A stretch of shore, now a jungle of lights and languages
that grudgingly offered, defeated, its obligation of sand.
The night of that day punished us at its whim.
I held you so close I could barely see you.
Autumn was brandishing guffaws and dancebands
and the sea tore at the pleasure-boats in a frenzy.
Your hand balanced, with its steady heat,
the wavering tepidness of alcohol. The gardens
came at me from far away through your skirt.
My high-tide mark rose to the level of your breasts.
Carpets, like tentacles, wriggling down to the strand,
attracted passers-by to the mouth of the clamor.
With lights and curtains, above the tedium
the bedrooms murmured in the grand hotels.
There are dark moments when our ballast gives out
from so much banging around. Moments, or centuries,
when the flesh revels in its nakedness and reels
to its own destruction, sucking the life from itself.
I groped around me, trying on your embrace,
but love was not where your embrace was.
I felt your hands stroking that physical ache
but a great nothing went before your hands.
I searched, down the length of your soulless surrender,
for a calm bay where I could cast a net,
yearning to hear a trace of the vendor's voice
still wet with the glimmer of the flapping minnows.
It was a spoiled remnant of the South. The aroma
of muscatel was tainted with whiskey breath.
I carry that dead embrace inside me yet
like a foreign object the flesh tries to reject.

the house where I was born
before foreclosure took away
the homestead I had sworn
in good faith, all attest 'tis true,
to leave grandchildren three: -
times change, leave little rest, I rue
that difference to me!
It seems so very long ago
the liberating Yanks
found welcome everywhere they'd go -
though some were pita swanks,
but since the Shah announced 'I ran'
our bearings all at sea
became - time reeled again would ban
all difference for me!
I remember, I remember
the sun porch, now in pawn,
proud flag a flying red, white, blue,
which now hangs so forlorn
Sun, moon spun round each priceless day,
or so I seemed to see,
four bucks a gallon gas I pay -
what difference to me!
My mind thought then nostalgic ease
eternally could last,
all my desires, priorities
seemed sated very fast,
The fever on my brow shoots higher
now Sheiks of Araby,
up ante for crude imports, tire -
what difference to me!
I remember, I remember
before Alaskan oil
had spilled upon once pristine shore,
polluting fauna, soil.
With climate change I'm feeling sore,
note each commodity
continues rising more and more -
what difference to me!
Back then I'd travel aimlessly,
cared not I ran Iraq,
from dawn till dark, from sea to sea
could, rising with the lark,
ignore the cost of gasoline
in land of liberty:
my budget now seems far more lean,
what difference to me!
I remember, I remember
before FEMA's disgrace,
I never thought dark terrorists
I might meet face to face,
Days fifty two times seven cheap,
no need to spare expense,
I'm farther now from Heaven's keep:
Oh boy!  What difference!

Past and Present
I remember, I remember
The house where I was born,
The little window where the sun
Came peeping in at morn;
He never came a wink too soon
Nor bought too long a day;
But now, I often wish the night
Had borne my breath away.
I remember, I remember
The roses, red and white,
The violets, and the lily-cups-
Those flowers made of light!
The lilacs where the robin built,
And where my brother set
The laburnum on his birthday, -
The tree is living yet!
I remember, I remember
Where I was used to swing,
And throught the air must rush as fresh
To swallows on the wing;
My spirit flew in feathers then
That is so heavy now,
And summer pools could hardly cool
The fever on my brow.
I remember, I remember
The fir frees dark and high;
I used to think their slender tops
Were close against the sky:
It was a childish ignorance,
But now 'tis little joy
To know I'm farther off from Heaven
Than when I was a boy.

I Remember
I remember, I remember
The house where I was born;
The rent was thirty-two a month,
Which made my father mourn.
He said he could remember when
His father paid the rent;
And when a man's expenses did
Not take his every cent.
I remember, I remember-
My mother telling my cousin
That eggs had gone to twenty-six
Or seven cents a dozen;
And how she told my father that
She didn't like to speak
Of things like that, but Bridget now
Demanded four a week.
I remember, I remember-
And with a mirthless laugh-
My weekly board at college took
A jump to three and a half.
I bought an eighteen-dollar suit,
And father told me, 'Sonny,
I'll pay the bill this time, but, Oh,
I am not made out of money! '
I remember, I remember,
When I was young and brave
And I declared, 'Well, Birdie, we
Shall now begin to save.'
It was a childish ignorance,
But now 'tis little joy
To know I'm farther off from wealth
Than when I was a boy.

I Remember
I remember, I remember,
When I discovered porn.
The little book that gave a boy -
Or so I heard – the horn:
It never meant a wank to me,
Nor did it drive me mad.
But in a funny kind of way
I often wish it had.
I remember, I remember,
The tweeny walking by,
I used to think her stocking-tops
Were close against her thigh:
It was a childish innocence.
But now ‘tis little joy
To know my thoughts are just as pure
As when I was a boy.

I Remember
I remember, I remember,
The house where I was wed,
And the little room from which, that night,
My smiling bride was led;
She didn’t come a wink too soon,
Nor make too long a stay;
But now I often wish her folks
Had kept the girl away!
I remember, I remember,
Her dresses, red and white,
Her bonnets and her caps and cloaks, -
The cost an awful sight!
The “corner lot” on which I built,
And where my brother met
At first my wife, one washing-day, -
That man is single yet!
I remember, I remember,
Where I was used to court,
And thought that all of married life*
Was just such pleasant sport:
My spirit flew in feathers then,
No care was on my brow;
I scarce could wait to shut the gate, -
I’m not so anxious now!
I remember, I remember,
My dear one’s smile and sigh;
I used to think her tender heart
Was close against the sky;
It was a childish ignorance,
But now it soothes me not
To know I’m farther off from heaven
Then when she wasn’t got!

I Remember
I remember, I remember,
(I wish I’d ne’er been born)
The little widow and her son
Came creeping in forlorn;
She never gave a wink too soon
Till he had gone to play;
But now, I oft regret that larks
Had borne that boy away.
I remember, I remember
The presents dear and cheap,
The letters and the valentines –
And othr things a heap!
The cottage which the masons built,
And where her youngster set
The pin pin upon the big arm chair –
That boy is living yet!
I remember, I remember
Her neck Itried to wring,
And saw the boy run out Pall Mall
Two peelers quick to bring;
My hair it flew in masses then,
I got a heavy blow,
The cold dark cell could hardly cool
The swelling on my brow.
I remember, I remember
A fair man, broad and hig;
I used to think his slender hair
Did match his clothes and tie;
It showed a childish ignorance,
But now ‘tis little joy
To know she ran away with him,
And left that awful boy.

“I remember, I remember,
The day that I was born,
When first I saw this breathing world,
All naked and forlorn,
They wrapped me in a linen cloth,
And then in one of frieze;
And tho’ I could not speak just then,
I still contrived to sneeze.”
“I remember, I remember,
Old ladies came from far;
Some said I was like mother dear,
But others thought like Pa;
Yet all agreed I had a head,
And most expressive eyes;
The latter were about as large
As plums in Christmas pies.”

I remember, I remember,
The cell, which now I scorn,
The little window where no sun
Could cheer the dreary morn.
Policeman X, no wink too son,
Brought in my musty fare,
And, growling as he went away,
Locked me in safely there!
I remember, I remember,
We’d been out late at night,
Twain herons who, o’er sundry cups,
Wound up by “getting tight; ”
And then although no blood was spilt,
That fiend in blue we met;
“Run in” upon my natal day –
Oh, would I could forget.
I remember, I remember,
No sofa would he bring,
He said the air seem’d rather fresh
For night birds on the wing!
The spirits needed feathers then,
And rest my fevered brow;
He only said, “The place is cool, ”
And, “Mind! don’t make a row! ”

Lucy
She dwelt among the untrodden ways
Beside the springs of Dove
A maid whom there were none to praise
And very few to love.
A violet by a mossy stone
Half-hidden from the eye;
Fair as a star when only one
Is shining in the sky.
She lived unknown, and few could know
When Lucy ceased to be;
But she is in her grave, and, oh,
The difference to me!
William WORDSWORTH 1770_1850

Lucy's Cousin
He lived amidst th’untrodden ways
To Rydal lake that lead;
A bard whom there were none to praise,
And very few to read.
Behind a cloud his mystic sense,
Deep hidden, who can spy?
Bright as the night when not a star
Is shining in the sky.
Unread his works – his “Milk White Doe”
With dust is dark and dim;
It’s still in Longman’s shop, and oh!
The difference to him!

A Song of the Cambridge Streets
We dwelt where youthful brains grow ripe,
A town not drain’d too well,
With here and there a choky pipe,
And here and there a smell.
They tore up streets, they dug below,
They made a deal of fuss,
Now sick’ning manholes reek, and oh!
The difference to us!

The Amateur Botanist
A primrose by a river's brim
‘Primula vulgaris’ was to him,
And it was nothing more;
A pansy, delicately reared,
‘Viola tricolor’ appeared
In true botanic lore.
That which a pink the layman deems
‘Dianthus caryophyllus’ seems
To any flower-fan; or
A sunflower, in that talk of his,
‘Annuus helianthus’ is,
And it is nothing more.

I had to keep on going without your love
Living my life the way I choose to
Discovering the things that are left for me to do
Doing the things that I love
Let there be light
Don't give excuses
Don't wait for answers
Don't wait for tomorrow
Don't ask me why
No need to be angry anymore
No need to wait anymore
For this special day, special hour,
No need to fight, just follow him, because
The Lord has come to set you free
The Lord has come to take you home
A place with no more pain and sorrows
Where you will find comfort and peace
Maybe someday, you will meet me again
A time has come to say” Good-bye'

When i saw you walk away
And i felt like i would never see you again

When i felt a little bit of my heart break
I remember it like it was yesterday
And you had nothing to say
It was my turn to walk away
I remember the day
When you first told me you loved me
I had waited so long to hear it
Even though i didn't, at first, believe it
But to hear it was so relieving
I remember the days
Of you and of me
Of everything we thought we'd be
Of everything we wanted to be
And me begging you to remember me
I'll always remember the day
When i watch you walk away
To start the next part of your life

I remember how with you,
total silence could be so comfortable,
and how it was the only time
in my life I ever felt that to be so.
I remember how safe I felt with you.
Even the way you said my name
was different from how others said it
and I remember feeling
that even my name
was safe in your mouth.
I remember how sometimes
we made love all night
and stayed in bed all day,
then skinny dipping
to cool down
all the secret places
our lovemaking heated up.
I remember lying in your arms
in the afterglow and thinking
how profound it was,
the way the brain hitched a ride
when the body did all the work.
You were my miracle
in our own short season,
and it makes me remember
the last time I saw you
because I will never forget

Mom and dad set the mold or pattern for children’s lives,
Proverbs 22: 6, “train up a child in the way he should go, ”
Early instruction signifies what direction the wind will blow.
Grab a Webster’s dictionary, looking up the word esteem,
Put the words high then low before, now what does it mean?
If it’s the latter, you’re seeking an excuse to quit and do less,
Or are you that someone who looks forward to the test?
Ecclesiastes 7: 1, a 'good name' sets the standard boundary,
I understand this to mean it is giving rules a basic legitimacy,
Sure is tough being a parent harder than I ever thought it’d be,
Only now do I understand what parents went through with me.
Hindsight is the best sight; “If I could do it all over again” is true,
However, since that is just impossible start now and begin anew,
All children will grow older and at eighteen most will know it all,
Feeling no need whatsoever to answer or obey their parent’s call.
If some didn’t at fifteen or earlier, then just what are we to do?
Constantly remind them God all things begin and end with You,
Not by what we tell them since action speaks louder than words,
Forget passively as a noun, but radical instruction like the verb.
Hey parents! At home you cuss, you smoke, you drink,
When your kids grow-up they will, what do you think?
However, everyday they see you read the bible & pray,
Your children’s children will respond in the same way.
Does it always turn out like this, how about the majority?
Those whom do not pick up these habits are a minority,
Till they leave home most will do what whatever’s seen,
Are you loving, kind, compassionate or down right mean?
As we diligently tutor our off spring an example will be set,
Do you trample over others? Taking all that you can get?
Punishment from God isn’t always, swift as it should be,
Remember mom and dad won’t have the luxury of eternity.
Many children are afflicted from the very first breath taken in time,
Thanks to parents who have nothing but themselves on their mind,
Starvation, sickness, beatings, crying for various reasons day & night,
Because those responsible for birth had to be a couple of butt-wipes."

or putting pockets on pants
because my little brother adored them

‘There’s all kinds of ways to say
I love you.’

‘A kind word to a stranger

Make them happen and never say ‘I can’t’

Arthritic wrists no longer need to worry,
their brushing days are over, now we have solutions.

Oh, there he is, that nice young fellow

The soup is hot and one large straw for me,

So, leaning back, my chair is rocking,
those little angels like my slurping.
Man's got to eat and will be heard.
I see the print on my calendar,
a great big  X    marked for tomorrow,
'Oh Grandpa, we have a surprise',
it says the ninetyseventh there,
I wonder who would get THAT old.
'A party you will not forget,
some dignitaries will be present,
the mayor and Gravedigger Johann, '
it must have been my son, said that.
'So would you kids like milk and..... thingies
and practice the piano now,
it must be just around the corner,
inside that whatyacallit chambers,
and tell me, lad, well would you know,
is Grandma coming back from shopping?
Oh- you don't say - so sorry, dear
it must have been a tragic loss.'
'Ahhh, thank you for reminding me,
so, all you kids it's time for homework,
I do expect that no mistakes
of any kind will sneak their way
into your clever heads today.
I will not help you with your math.
But please be silent while you work,
I'll drink my whiskey, have a snooze.
Just wake me when Lucille comes back,
she does expect the house be tidy,
and tell me when you find my old piano.'

He settles back and eighteen pairs of twinkling eyes
look with a mix of love and wonder
at the old Geezer who has been
a friend for all those early years.
And two more sips of amber spirits,
lead, fading fast,  to early times,
he wonders briefly if one day
a cold air front would bring an end
to miracles of common childhood.
It did not matter to him now,
nor did he want to ask the young ones,
what years had passed in his long life.
By then, a silent frown had settled
upon his forehead and he mused
just how Lucille would view the future."

1577,Emotion,RememberPoemsIRememberWellThatSummerPlacePoembyarchielangford,"I remember well that summer place,
The sun, the sea, the surf soaked sand,
The light that lit your lovley face,
As we splashed bare foot, hand in hand.
And in the evening on the pier,
Our bodies sore from too much sun,
Tenderly I held you near,
We danced to Cyril Stapleton.
And later in that gox on wheels,
Laughingly called a caravan,
Where we cooked our meagre meals,
And loved as only lovers can.
And now so many years have passed,
I`ve grown old, (I hope with grace) .
Countless memories I`ve amassed,
But I remember well that summer place."
1578,Emotion,RememberPoemsCanTForgetYouOnlyRememberPoembyGaryMcPhail,"Can't forget you
Only remember
A Grandad more unique than any other!
I don't remember much.
I will remember this,
You are my Grandad,
Who I'll deffinatley miss.
A giant afro sat above your head,
Sneak into the kitchen,
For a quick cigarette
Even if you were caught,
There were no excuses made,
Quick thinkin' smooth talker.
Someone else was to blame!
Announcing names,
For the draw on sunday,
Playing pool for the win,
Accused for a fix,
Never afraid at the night of games.
A good old laugh,
With a good old man
A jolly old fellow,
With a good long past.
You've been around for many years,
many memories to be remembered,
We wont forget you,
Becuase we cant. Its' just to hard.
even if we tried,
You would still live on
In all our lives.
I love you Grandad"
1579,Emotion,RememberPoemsDoYouRememberPoembySandraFowler,"The river in December
Do you remember?
When time was graying
Old leaves decaying?
We walked by that water,
That mindless water.
Watching two leaves in their reflection
Swept away without direction.
We walked by that water,
That mindless water.
Following them until we were frozen
For there was no end to that way once chosen."
1580,Emotion,RememberPoemsIRememberPoembyMahfoozAli,"When I looked into your eyes,
I knew it was true-
My heart never lies-
I was in love with you.
As you stood there
Just looking around
My whole body melted
into the ground.
I remember the day,
I remember the time,
I remember the place,
It is always on my mind.
You looked so good
In your shirt and jeans.
I remember that night
You were in my dreams.
I wished I could be with you
day after day,
Because I love you more
than words can ever say."
1581,Emotion,RememberPoemsIRememberYesIRememberPoembyRolandEde,"I remember, Yes, I remember
The Summer of forty - two
The sirens loud
The guns and bombs
In Britains struggle
To win through
And at that time,
A change of Schools
Sent me to Holly Park,
So strict but fair
No place to suffer fools
Then in these momentous day's
A happening so great
To shake my youthful way's.
I remember, yes, I remember
The girl that I saw there
In class 1a, the same as I
I tried hard not to stare
Her hair so dark and neat
With eyes more brown than brown
I glimpsed her in her seat.
And even then
My heartstring woke
And stirred within my mind.
Her name was Joyce
And plain to see
She was the girl for me,
We went through School
And not a class apart
Until our time was through
Fourteen, the year to leave
Our working life to start.
I remember, yes, I remember
The winter of forty - five
Her Schooldays done
Six months in front of mine,
This must be it!
She's gone
And I'd not sense to ask
To meet again
And could it be soon?
New way's for us so young
Find jobs and learn a trade.
A year slips by
Sad thoughts of date's not made.
I remember, yes, I remember
The winter of forty - six,
While working in my office
A new girl is employed
I know this girl!
It's Joyce's friend
From Holly Park our School!
I ask her how Joyce is
The answer 'very well'
I say 'and will you please
Ask if we can meet? '
The answer relayed back to me
It really is a yes!
The meet's arranged
Its in our lunch hour
We'll meet on her way home
Ten minutes by bus
And I am there
I know ehere she will walk
My tie is straight
Excitement tense
But can I sensibly talk?
I see her then
It's her and no mistake,
Her hair so dark
Eye's sparkling brown
The Schoolgirl that I knew
No longer was in view,
But here, grown up,
And very lovely too.
We talked and walked
To where she lived
Time short
Cant be late
I had to catch my bus
Must go, but then
I have just made the date!
I remember, yes, I remember
The evening of our first date,
Cold January twenty - nine,
I'm early (can not be late)
I wait outside the Odeon,
Who's cold? not me, I'm fine
The bus, a one-two-five
Comes rushing to a stop
I see her getting off and then
I greet her with a smile
Two two and nine's
The price I pay
The best seats in the house
And would she like some choc's?
The ones we both will always share
Our favourite, Dairy Box.
The film show over now
We stand for 'God save the King'
It's time to take her home,
We queue together at the stop
The wind blows freezing cold
I wrap my coat around us both
I say, to keep her warm
But truth to own
It brings us close
So I can look
Into her eyes so brown.
I remember, yes, I remember
The Autumn of Nineteen fifty,
Three happy years we've spent
Together all the while
And now it's National Service time
My call-up soon is sent
Two years to serve,
It's in the RAF,
How long to be apart?
It's not so bad
As I had thought
I often can get home
On many a week-end pass.
Our letters to each other
Pass daily in the post
Mine sometimes do contain
A short but loving rhyme,
And hers to me the same
But sometimes also this
End with a lipstick kiss.
My National Service days now done
I'm back in Civvis Street
So good to see her all the time
To make our plans complete.
Ten years have now gone by
Since the Summer of forty-two
When first I saw her face,
Then was it luck?
Or maybe fate?
That Winter of forty-six.
I remember, yes, I remember
The Summer of fifty-three,
The Queen and Coronation day,
But no, much more than that
In June that year our Wedding
At All Saints, Oakleigh Road,
I turn and look to see her
Coming down the Aisle
She's on her Father's arm
Her dress pure white
And darker shows her hair
Her eyes of course are shining brown
But finely covered by her veil
Then smiles that both we share,
She says 'I will' so softly
Then in my turn
I say that 'I will' too
A fine Reception
Enjoyed by all
Was in the Springfield Hall
Then came the time
For Bride and Groom to leave
The music, food and wine.
Her Mother came and held my hand
And said 'look after her'
She knew of course I would,
I said 'you know I will'
The best way that I could
I remember, yes, I remember
The Spring of fifty-seven
In March that year
Was born, and to our joy,
A healthy baby Boy.
Two years on,
Then April fifty-nine,
To put us in a whirl,
A lovely baby Girl.
I remember, yes, I remember
All the years since then,
A further forty-eight have passed.
So can it really be
Sixty years and five
Since that Summer of forty-two
When first we met in School
Two images have stayed
Fixed always in my mind,
Of Joyce at Holly Park School
Sitting at her desk,
And see her then so clear
Stepping from the Bus,
And knowing that from there
It'll be not you or me
But us."
1582,Emotion,RememberPoemsIRememberZimmyPoembyRevDrAJacobHassler,"Oh, i remember Zimmy
Quiet, anxious, and young
But you never could believe a single damn word
That fell from Zimmy’s tongue
He’d play that beat-up guitar of his
Everyday in Maggie’s barn
Singin’ about some jilted maiden
Or spinnin’ some great yarn
he wasn’t much of a musician
he didn’t have much of a voice
but when he cranked out those crazy stories,
Zimmy really made some noise!
They say he packed his few possessions
And put his thumb out on the road
He disappeared from our small town
Headed out east, i’m told
None of us have heard from him since
Most of us doubt we will
As i walk by Old Maggie’s homestead
I think of Zimmy still...
Saw Zimmy’s New York face
On the cover of some hot shot magazine
Said he wrote a far-out song
About a man who played the tambourine
Said he wrote a far-out song
About a man who played the tambourine"

Can I describe with music,

Can I describe with colour,

Can I describe with action,

Can I describe with numbers,

Where all else fails
poetry begins to show
a world that few can mention.
But every one does know
this world which quietly
hides from our inattention.
It’s that which finds you

Remember the flower, love
blooming night. The petals
lit on fire-
a million miles of moonlight
bending from the sky,
pin pointing the infinite places, and
the dark corners I kissed you
Remember the blossom, love
early spring- suckling,
reaching for something
unworldly
What the night remembers
it plants in memory, which spawn
wings that lead to dream
as we restless, rarely sleep.
Remember the flower, love-
what it leaves behind:
nostalgic flesh, that
navigates rain and remembrance"

you were my favorite.
High on cough syrup
I asked you to be my girl
told you I was thinking about
another town
a new start
but if you’d be my girl,
I’d stay
you agreed and we played in the park
that night for hours,
kissing and building miniature
stick houses
it took us half and hour maybe
to cross the bridge
and those Christians
slowed to walk with and
talk with us
they wanted us to know

you were always my favorite."

But please remember the many hugs after those nights.
If tomorrow doesn’t come

Even though I don’t show it.
Please remember how much of an impact you have on my life.
Even though I don’t help you to acknowledge it.
Please remember how much I love you

Please remember that you are apart of what I am today
Even though I don’t ever say anything.
Please remember that I always care about you
Even though I am always in your business or your life too much than usual.
Please remember to smile if tomorrow doesn’t come
Please remember that I tried to make something out of your life and mine too.
Please remember my laughter

And speak unto Me,
That I might guide thy step.
Throughout the day
In those quiet moments.
Remember Me that we be not far apart.
In the evening,
Lay thy head down unto Me,
For I shall speak of how I love thee.
In sleep, dream of Me,
For there, we are together again,
Walking side by side.
Commune with Me in these little ways
And, I will in no wise forget thee,
Or our time spent together,
For I will lift thee up
Out of the Fire and bring unto Me
A clean soul to embrace,
And forever we shall walk together
In the garden of My “Highest Kingdom”
You and I together,
Forever in Me,
Amen.

1588,Emotion,RememberPoemsDoYouRememberOncePoembyAlanSeeger,"Do you remember once, in Paris of glad faces,
The night we wandered off under the third moon's rays
And, leaving far behind bright streets and busy places,
Stood where the Seine flowed down between its quiet quais?
The city's voice was hushed; the placid, lustrous waters
Mirrored the walls across where orange windows burned.
Out of the starry south provoking rumors brought us
Far promise of the spring already northward turned.
And breast drew near to breast, and round its soft desire
My arm uncertain stole and clung there unrepelled.
I thought that nevermore my heart would hover nigher
To the last flower of bliss that Nature's garden held.
There, in your beauty's sweet abandonment to pleasure,
The mute, half-open lips and tender, wondering eyes,
I saw embodied first smile back on me the treasure
Long sought across the seas and back of summer skies.
Dear face, when courted Death shall claim my limbs and find them
Laid in some desert place, alone or where the tides
Of war's tumultuous waves on the wet sands behind them
Leave rifts of gasping life when their red flood subsides,
Out of the past's remote delirious abysses
Shine forth once more as then you shone, -- beloved head,
Laid back in ecstasy between our blinding kisses,
Transfigured with the bliss of being so coveted.
And my sick arms will part, and though hot fever sear it,
My mouth will curve again with the old, tender flame.
And darkness will come down, still finding in my spirit
The dream of your brief love, and on my lips your name.
II
You loved me on that moonlit night long since.
You were my queen and I the charming prince
Elected from a world of mortal men.
You loved me once. . . . What pity was it, then,
You loved not Love. . . . Deep in the emerald west,
Like a returning caravel caressed
By breezes that load all the ambient airs
With clinging fragrance of the bales it bears
From harbors where the caravans come down,
I see over the roof-tops of the town
The new moon back again, but shall not see
The joy that once it had in store for me,
Nor know again the voice upon the stair,
The little studio in the candle-glare,
And all that makes in word and touch and glance
The bliss of the first nights of a romance
When will to love and be beloved casts out
The want to question or the will to doubt.
You loved me once. . . . Under the western seas
The pale moon settles and the Pleiades.
The firelight sinks; outside the night-winds moan --
The hour advances, and I sleep alone.
III
Farewell, dear heart, enough of vain despairing!
If I have erred I plead but one excuse --
The jewel were a lesser joy in wearing
That cost a lesser agony to lose.
I had not bid for beautifuller hours
Had I not found the door so near unsealed,
Nor hoped, had you not filled my arms with flowers,
For that one flower that bloomed too far afield.
If I have wept, it was because, forsaken,
I felt perhaps more poignantly than some
The blank eternity from which we waken
And all the blank eternity to come.
And I betrayed how sweet a thing and tender
(In the regret with which my lip was curled)
Seemed in its tragic, momentary splendor
My transit through the beauty of the world."
1589,Emotion,RememberPoemsIRememberTheDayDadPoembyVikramGAarella,"I remember the day dad,
When you chased me around, to get me to hospital
For the treatment of fever which I had.
I remember the day dad,
When you scolded me and hit me
And later how you felt bad.
I remember the day dad,
When for the first time you took me to school
Leaving me there, how you felt sad.
I remember the day dad,
When I got into medical college
And with happiness you went mad.
I remember the day dad,
In your village, in front of your elders
How you behaved like an obedient lad.
I remember the day dad,
When we both felt upset
As India lost a test match in Trinidad.
I remember the day dad,
When I was feeling low and had lost all hope
But you always had a word of encouragement and advise to add.
I remember these entire days dad,
I cherish the memories of us together
To have had a father like you I am really lucky and glad.
I remember each and every day,
When you had so many things to do
And I always learnt something from you."

hiding, crying,
cowering, screaming,
begging God to end my life

my disappointment
in waking each and every day
and how I cursed his name, in anger
I remember
so many years
wasted in despair
as I died a little each day
I remember
the day I was freed
badly frightened I was
that there was nothing left of me
I remember
falling in love
and finally feeling
that I truly am alive
I remember
what I was before
thankful for what I am
and for oh so much more
I will remember

that was given me by those I love
It is all of you I will forever remember"

An army of one
To please my father and excite

But all I have seen
Is dead children and old men
I have aged in a few months
And found bitterness
My tent buddy is dead
Another statistic for the army
A bad dream for me
And horror I will never forget
In forty years will I still cry
At my companies dinners
Wonder why I was there at all
Will I be uncomfortable to be with
As I cannot forget the commandment,
' Thou shalt not kill '."

Keep my head up I'm a soldier, I'm tough to the core.
My fear is my weakness, Let my weakness be gone.
I know I'm a soldier, I've been one all along.
We are picking our battles, Fighting our wars.
We hold the weight of the world, Our minds and bodies are sore.
But push on I'm on a soldier, The stronger of some.

Napoleon or Caesar
Out of you grew.
Out of the unthinkable torture,
Eyes kissed by death,
Won back to the world again,
Lost and won in a breath,
Cruel men are made immortal,
Out of your pain born.
They have stolen the sun’s power
With their feet on your shoulders worn.
Let them shrink from your girth,
That has outgrown the pallid days,
When you slept like Circe’s swine,
Or a word in the brain’s way."

Honour ne'er was won in sleeping,
Never when the sunbeams still
Lay unreflected on the hill:
'Tis when they are glinted back
From axe and armour, spear and jack,
That they promise future story
Many a page of deathless glory.
Shields that are the foe man's terror,
Ever are the morning's mirror.
Arm and up - the morning beam
Hath call'd the rustic to his team,
Hath call'd the falc'ner to the lake,
Hath call'd the huntsman to the brake;
The early student ponders o'er
His dusty tomes of ancient lore.
Soldier, wake - thy harvest, fame;
Thy study, conquest; war, thy game.
Shield, that would be foeman's terror,
Still should gleam the morning's mirror.
Poor hire repays the rustic's pain;
More paltry still the sportsman's gain;
Vainest of all, the student's theme
End in gome metaphysic dream.
Yet each is up, and each has toil'd
Since first the peep of dawn has smiled;
And each is eagerer in his aim
Than he who barters life for fame.
Up, up, and arm thee, son of terror!
Be thy bright shield the morning's mirror."

His body tired and weak as his feet pierce the sand,
Ten thousand miles from happiness and safety,
As he cries from the top of his lungs; god please save me.
The agony of this chosen life has struck him hard,
There’s nowhere left to run and it’s already going dark,
Can he survive another night in this desert?
A part of him feels like giving up and saying forget it.
It’s been another day of nothing but bloodshed,
He gave all he could until he had nothing else left,
But maybe tomorrow things will be different,
As he listens to the sound of the mortars in the distance.
The intense heat of the morning sun strikes his forehead,
As he pinches his skin so tightly to confirm he’s not yet dead,
It’s time to start moving and escape from this living hell,
Will he make it out of here alive, only time will tell.
He has walked for hours and hours and still he’s no closer,
All he wants is to be with his beautiful wife and hold onto her,
There she is, he can see her standing at the bottom of the sand dune,
As he starts running towards her he can’t believe he’s going to see her again so soon.
He makes it safely down to the bottom,
Arms open wide; he thought he’d been forgotten,
And that’s when the intense pain hit him in his tracks,
As he falls to the ground, what was that?
Nothing is clear to him anymore, his eyes are blinkered,
The bullet has just struck him, as he lay there injured,
He watches as the blood drains from his body,
Wondering what will people think of me?
He pulls out a small picture and kisses his wife goodbye,
He holds it so tightly as he looks up to the dark sky,
As he slips away knowing his time here on earth is over,
He still feels proud to have lived the life of a ‘soldier’.

How I miss you so.
I think about you everyday,
And when you're coming home.
Dear, Soldier Boy,
I hope you write back soon.
Tomorrow's Sarah's birthday.
Her party starts at noon.
Dear, Soldier Boy,
I love you more each day.
My love for you grows stronger,
The longer you're away.
Dear, Soldier Boy,
I haven't heard from you at all.
Maybe I will get a letter,
By the time of Fall.
Dear, Soldier Boy,
June 15,2008.
They told me you were wounded,
And they got you help too late.

How I miss you so.
I think about you everyday,
And why you didn't come back home"

And scribble something with a pencil.
Where is the bitter pill that neutralizes the hunger?
I have never been to a school and don't know the capital letters,
Commas, Fullstops, Semicolons and Question marks in this misery life.
Even I cannot erase my sins as it's against the law it seems.
I humbly request a death with dignity
If someone hears patiently?

1605,Emotion,SoldierPoemsTheYoungSoldierPoembyWilfredOwen,"It is not death
Without hereafter
To one in dearth
Of life and its laughter,
Nor the sweet murder
Dealt slow and even

Smiling at heaven:
It is the smile
Faint as a (waning) myth,
Faint, and exceeding small
On a boy's murdered mouth."
1606,Emotion,SoldierPoemsASoldierPoembyDeniseGirod,"Your Freedom he fights for you to keep
So you will be safe while you sleep
You condem him for being wrong
Yet the Soldier always stands strong
While you have the right to complain
A Soldier will fight for you, in the pouring rain
While he leaves his family behind
They are never very far from his mind
Remember every negative word you say
for YOU a Soldier keeps terror and bay
While a Soldier he may die
While a man he will not turn a blind eye"
1607,Emotion,SoldierPoemsASoldierInTheArmyOfChristPoembyLukeEaster,"Are there currently trials and tribulations in your life?
Where as you’re going through a real hard time right?
You’ve prayed and asked in the name of Jesus Christ,
Chaos is still there smack dab in the middle of the fight.
Luke 22: 42, use the word of Christ Jesus, “Nevertheless, ”
1st Peter 4: 12, in place of bewilderment at your fiery test,
Separate yourself from doubt and weakness of the rest,
Numbers 14: 24, the spirit of Caleb allowed him to possess.
It’s too cold today, I much rather stay where it’s warm inside,
Or maybe I’ll flee to another country for a few years and hide,
What army in the world would ever be able to succeed?
If soldiers only decided to serve when they felt the need.
Armies could never win without dedication and pride,
With a cloud blocking the sun they would run and hide,
Everyone who’s about to go into battle will honestly admit,
Being leery of the person behind them who's known to quit.
Sometimes you must bear Jesus’ suffering and pain,
We are disciplined for battle not in sunshine but rain.
God’s boot camp is purposely held deep in the valley,
Every war is most deadly in the darkness of the ally.
Training is exceedingly, abundantly, above and beyond the norm,
Not wearing warm-ups, sneakers or cosmetics, they wear uniforms,
Neither will these recruits whine, frown, get angry, cry or complain,
That’s left to civilians where soldiers can do all things in Jesus name.
Being a ruler in heaven by all will not be realized,
As with the animal kingdom only the strong survive,
We have to trust that God knows the reasons why,
Everyone isn’t capable of being in charge of other lives.
Leaders in eternity will not be by lottery or random pick,
In order to test your quality God might intentionally afflict,
Even redirect your finances causing the outlook to look bleak,
I Thes.5: 18 always give thanks no matter how strong or weak.
For attacks against our youth, training can be found where?
The motto of the Boy Scouts of America is, “Be Prepared, ”
Train to be meticulous, proficient through repetition be bold,
Suit of armor, powerful, mighty, pulling down of strongholds.
Being a general in the army which one would you prefer to command?
Your soldier, “I don’t know if I can make it” or, “most assuredly I can, ”
Is the private in basic training who shows initiative the 1st to promote?
Or the out of shape sluggard always with an excuse, cracking jokes?
“I will never fail you or forsake you” Joshua 1: 5 proclaims,
It’s the ultimate test of your faith, relying on His Holy name,
No matter how tumultuous the rain that is pounding your life,
Only the elite are chosen, “A Soldier In The Army Of Christ! ”"

Throw your gun away,
Your child is waiting for you
Bring her some toys to play.
Throw the medals, throw the uniform
Head back to your home land,
Your wife is struggling without you
Give her a helping hand.
Killing innocent people is not war
It is manslaughter and murder,
Your mother is worried about you
Don’t make her last days harder.
This war has no moral or ethics
Being fought for greed and money
Your pet dog is missing you
Give it your love and company.
Crops in your field have grown taller
No one is there to harvest them
Your friends are short of a player
Come home, come back to them.

1610,Emotion,SoldierPoemsABalladToTheSoldierPoembyjohannweiss,"There is a flag on the door, and joy left on the floor,
A woman sobs all day long crying to the tune of an old song
A voice cries “Where is he, Where is he? ”
This voice haunts the woman and emphasizes all her wants
There is letter in the mail that tells the tail
She opens the letter asking….
“where is he, where is he.”
There is a baby cold and lonely, lonely to come
With tears that are not formed yet, nor even a thought
In a cradle to the side longing for the second face……
The letter answered the woman………..
“Your husband died a glorious death, and lived a humble life,
And yet now we grieve to see that this man is dead”
How will the child be fed?"
1611,Emotion,SoldierPoemsAtTheGraveOfTheUnknownSoldierPoembyFrancisDuggan,"He was a brave soldier he died young and brave
And for more than six decades he lay in his grave
And still at the dawning of each war memorial day
At his grave site a young bugler the last post does play.
Known as the Unknown Soldier one without a name
Still he had a mum and a dad just the same
And when he did not return home when the fighting was done
They grieved at their loss and they wept for their son.
The war to end all wars of all wars 'tis said
But more wars are fought and we have more war dead
And at the grave of the unknown soldier the last post is played
And to honour the war dead another parade.
Old war men do tell us young soldiers fight and die
For freedom and liberty that is a lie
They went to war when young they are now old and gray
Some grow old not wiser some are known to say.
That they were fighting for freedom and justice they believed to be true
And they were quite gallant to give them their due
But many deprived of their human rights in the World of today
And that does seem a very sad thing for to say.
With heads bowed old men showing their years in gray
At the grave of the Unknown Soldier at the dawn of the day
In silence do listen as a young bugler the last post does play
For one who fought and died in a war far away."

I was not cruel or heartless.
I did not live with hate.
I merely did what you asked.
My last night, was not in the arms of my lover.
My last day, was not in the land of my father.
My last thoughts, were not of my mother.
My last words, were never uttered.
I did not seek glory.
I had no need to find riches.
I was not a coward,
I did not fear death.
I paid the cost of one life,
I cannot really say why.
I soaked my blood into another man's soil,
I looked for the last time at another man's sky.
When you see my name upon a wall, do not cry,
I knew, that it was my job to die.
I expect no sympathy
I just ask, remember me..."

in a war over seas
a soldier said a prayer
by his bed on his knees
He said 'I don't wanna be here
but i can not leave
Lord please let my family
have a great christmas eve'
This soldier I speak of
Will Have Christmas alone
all that he has
is a package from home
Inside of the package
was a great surprise
it was a picture of his family
he wiped the tears from his eyes
His wife left a note that said
we are all alone
the kids miss their daddy
please hurry back home
his six year old daughter
gave a teddybear to her dad
along with a note
that said this will help when you're sad
The soldier picked up his gun
and went back out to work
and then he noticed a kid
that looked like he was hurt
the soldier said
'What's the matter kid, what is your bother? '
the kid responded by saying
'They just shot my father.'
The soldier said
'I've got something for you, to make you less sad'
Then he pulled out a teadybear and said
let this remind you of your dad
The soldier went on his way
to continue to fight
and said 'Merry Christmas to all
and to all a good night'"
1614,Emotion,SoldierPoemsTapsForMySoldierPoembyCJHeck,"A gentle breeze chatters the leaves
as birds sing their greetings.
The sun shines, a day like any other,
and yet like none before.
Two mirrored rows of uniforms
lined up like blue dominoes,
white gloves holding rifles at the ready.
One lone bugle cries.
Twenty-four notes,
each note slow as a tear,
blankets ears and heavy hearts.
In the silence between,
nature holds its breath.
Gone is the wind.
Gone are the bird songs.
Gone is her hold on composure,
all lost in the bugle's lament.
Solemnly a soldier approaches,
white gloves present a tri-fold flag,
and in one final mournful note,
legions of silent voices unite
to call a comrade home
and a young wife weeps."
1615,Emotion,SoldierPoemsSoldierMaidenAndFlowerPoembyEugeneField,"'Sweetheart, take this,' a soldier said,

But love can never die.
Be steadfast in thy troth to me,
And then, whate'er my lot,
'My soul to God, my heart to thee,'-
Sweetheart, forget me not! '
The maiden took the tiny flower
And nursed it with her tears:
Lo! he who left her in that hour
Came not in after years.
Unto a hero's death he rode
'Mid shower of fire and shot;
But in the maiden's heart abode
The flower, forget-me-not.
And when he came not with the rest
From out the years of blood,
Closely unto her widowed breast
She pressed a faded bud;
Oh, there is love and there is pain,
And there is peace, God wot,-
And these dear three do live again
In sweet forget-me-not.
'T is to an unmarked grave to-day
That I should love to go,-
Whether he wore the blue or gray,
What need that we should know?
'He loved a woman,' let us say,
And on that sacred spot,
To woman's love, that lives for aye,
We'll strew forget-me-not.

For the way that people now look at you

You fought a war that was not your own
on foreign land so far away.
Then came home to loved ones family and friends
in a much, much different way.
Your legs removed your arms now gone
we welcomed you back with flags and patriotic songs.
But now you sit forgotten and alone
while away the bank has taken your home.
So why not sit in the anger you feel?
it is all of what you see to be real.
You fought to protect a world unknown

Win or lose you are committing a sin
In war there are no victorious winners.

Devastation, death, shock and awe
The true meaning of that little word war.
Human beings slain, wounded and in pain.
Never being able to live normal lives again.
Gallant men and women meet their maker.
And end up in the obituaries of the daily paper.
Mother and father weep for their son and daughter.
Whilst war carries on with it’s insane slaughter.
Oh God give me you’re almighty strength.
So that I.
May never have to pull the trigger,
and see another human die.
Yes I am most fortunate that I survived,
But my heart grieves for those who died."

The farm is just a ways down the road
I wonder if she knows, I'm coming
And I wonder , if she is there alone
It's been a year since the war called me
I went away to do what I had to do
It's been a year since I held her in my arms
It's been a year, shes had time to choose
I've seen many soldiers get the letter
Letters from someone that said goodbye
And each time the mail when it would come
I would brace myself and worry if I got mine
Now it's been a year and I'm coming home
But time can change ones  mind sometimes
And if shes waiting like she said she would
Then today will be the day I make her mine
I kept every letter that she wrote
In battle I kept them close to my heart
She has always been the world to me
I couldn't imagine my life with out my sweet heart
As I pull into the drive I can see
Someone has raised a flag with one lone star
And I can see a banner just beneath
And I read as I pull up in the car
' The love of my life '
' Is fighting for your Life '
' Dear God '
' Please let him come back home to me '."
1619,Emotion,SoldierPoemsACowboySoldierPoembyPaulAlbertBell,"I can see a soldier's mother
Knitting quietly in the lamplight,
Her precious thoughts are for another
Who has been sent away to fight.
She is remembering a tousled haired boy
Running through the house to play.
She is remembering the heartfelt joy
Of washing and nurturing him each day.
She gloried in his every little achievement
For he was her flesh and blood.
It was only temporary bereavement
When he would come in covered with mud.
Sometimes he rode a stick horse
All over a vast front yard range.
He was rounding up cattle of course
Every detail he took care to arrange.
Somtimes he rode till it was night
Searching this range for his cattle.
He was never far from his mother's sight
For she loved watching him ride high in the saddle.
These were the magnificent glory years
Of a tousled haired boy and his mother.
As she knitted she saw through her tears
A mighty little cowboy unlike any other.
Now he has gone down to the battle
To fight for his country and his home.
But he has not forgotten the front yard cattle
And the mighty range he used to roam.
With the bursting of every bomb and shell
He remembers those who loved him so.
He remembers his mother's supper yell
And her precious face that would always glow.
She was a broken hearted mother
When this cowboy soldier never made it home.
She thought her heart would smother
As she knelt in prayer on the range he used to roam.
There wasn't any fine oration
There wasn't any beautiful song.
This boy had met his obligation
And he stood above the throng.
Today I believe this cowboy is exploring
The range in his new home.
I believe our precious Lord is adoring
A cowboy who has a brand new range to roam."

1621,Emotion,SoldierPoemsOhHesNothingButASoldierPoembyAnonymousAmericas,"'Oh! he's nothing but a soldier,'
But he's coming here tonight,
For I saw him pass this morning,
With his uniform so bright.
He was coming in from picket,
Whilst he sung a sweet refrain,
And he kissed his hand at some one
Peeping through the window pane.
Ah! he rode no dashing charger
'With a black and flowing mane,'
But his bayonet glistened brightly,
As the sun lit up the plain.
No waving plume or feather
Flashed its crimson in the light -
He belonged to the Light Infantry,
And he came to war- to fight.
'Oh! he's nothing but a soldier,'
His trust is in his sword -
To carve his way to glory,
Through the servile Yankee horde.
No pompous pageant heralds him,
No sycophants attend,
In his belt you see his body guard -
His tried and trusty friend.
'Oh! he's nothing but a soldier,'
And a stranger in our land;
His home is in the sunny South,
By the blue Gulf's golden strand.
But I wish I knew his people,
Some little of his past,
For father's always telling me
About our 'social caste'.
'Oh! he's nothing but a soldier,'
But his eyes are very fine,
And I sometimes think, when passing,
They are piercing into mine.
Pshaw! 'He's nothing but a soldier,'
Come, let me be discreet;
But really, for a soldier,
His toilet's very neat.
'Oh! he's nothing but a soldier,'
But last night he came to tea -
What an interesting soldier -
But then, he's rather free.
'Twas two o'clock this morning,
Before he took his leave;
He has my ring - the fellow!
But what's the use to grieve?
He has been again to see us,
The 'gentleman' in grey;
He calls to see us often -
Our house is on his way
At times he sadly seeks the shade
Of yonder grove of trees,
I watched him once - this soldier -
I saw him on his knees.
One day last week I asked him
To tell me of his home.
He answered, pointing to his camp,
'Where'er these brave ones roam.'
I asked him once to tell me
Of his mother, sister dear;
A funeral cortege passed along -
Said he, 'You have them here.'
'Oh, he's nothing but a soldier,'
But this I know right well,
He has a heart of softness
Where tender virtues dwell;
For once when we were talking,
And no one else was near,
I saw him very plainly
Try to hide a startling tear.
We are speaking of Manassas,
Of that first great bloody day,
When a handful of our 'bra'e ones'
Held the Yankee hosts at bay.
'Twas here he lost his aged sire,
While fighting by his side;
He sleeps beneath the crimson turf,
Where roil'd that bloody tide.
'Oh, he's nothing but a soldier,'
But within that eye so clear,
There lurks no craven spirit,
No timid glance of fear;
For though at pity's pleading
It can melt with tender light,
I've seen it flash like lightning
Across the brow of night.
'Oh, he's nothing but a soldier,'
Such as pass us every day.
He calls them 'Ragged Devils,'
But you know that's just his way.
But there is one thing very funny,
One thing I can't explain
That when this soldier goes away,
I wish him back again.
'Oh, he's nothing but a soldier,'
And a stranger yet to fame;
But they tell me in the army,
That the 'Boys' all know his name;
The Yankees, too, have heard it,
They dread his battle shout;
They have no wish to meet him,
This dreaded Southern scout.
'Oh, he's nothing but a soldier,'
Yet you'd call his features good;
That cut he got at West Point,
While fighting under Hood.
He has a halting in his gait,
A trifle in the knee;
He brought it back from Sharpsburg,
Where he went with General Lee.
'Oh, he's nothing but a soldier,'
But his triumphs are not few;
He has seen our glorious battle flag
In all its trials through;
At Seven Pines he followed it,
On the heights at Gaines' Mill;
At Williamsburg, at West Point,
In the smoke of Malvern Hill.
Oh, he's nothing but a soldier,
But, then, its very queer -
I feel somehow when absent
I'd rather have him near.
He's gone to meet the foeman,
To stay his bloody track -
O! Heaven shield the soldier,
O, God, let him come back!
He is back again, this soldier,
With his eyes so deep and clear,
And his voice like falling waters,
Maketh music to my ear.
One empty coat-sleeve dangles,
Where once a stout arm grew,
But this soldier says, in hugging
He has no use for two.
'Oh, he's nothing but a soldier,'
And I know that on his form
He bears the scars of conflict
And of many a battle storm.
But I wouldn't give this soldier,
In his simple, humble home,
For all your perfumed monkeys,
That strut about the town.
He is back again, this soldier;
He is sitting by my side,
Tomorrow, ho! for Texas
With his young Virginia bride.
True, 'he's nothing but a soldier,'
But I'm now his loving wife;
Pledged, through good report, or evil,
To dwell with him through life."
1622,Emotion,SoldierPoemsToySoldierPoembyVickieForrestWiggs,"I have a toy soldier that sits high up on my shelf,
I'm not allowed to play with him, so he sits there by himself,
He looks so alone, yet so handsome and tall,
As he watches over me... fighting for us all. I wish that I could reach him, just to tell him that I care,
But, I am yet too small to reach him way up there,
Even though he can't hear me, I pray for him each night,
I pray for peace on earth..so he won't have to fight. As I grew taller and wiser, I begin to understand,
That the toy soldier upon my shelf was a picture of a man.
As I reached out for it, I was able to finally see
That the toy soldier that I admired...looked just like me. Our soldiers are not wooden, they have a family somewhere,
They have wives and children and parents who care,
And though they can't hear us, we pray each night
That our toy soldiers...won't have to fight."

Dreaming fair songs for God;

1625,Emotion,SoldierPoemsSoldierPoembyAlfHutchison,"A tribute to Rhodesia's Soldier Pioneers.
He held Dads medals in his hand,
As they lowered his casket down
A hole dug in that barren land,
On the slopes of Salisbury Town.
Head bowed down towards the sand,
Tears raining from his eye,
On the Medals clutched within his hand,
Like raindrops from on high.
He listened to the prayers and Word,
And to the eulogy;
No finer words had this lad heard,
Of his only progeny.
Rhodesia was, in those first days,
Untamed and fancy free,
Dingaan was the black mans praise,
King of M’tabele.
All the pacts and treaties broken,
By Dingaan and his son,
Treaties both penned and spoken,
Now broken every one.
Rebellion grew against those white
By blacks a thirst for war,
Warriors vexing their great might
Were fifty score, times four.
An assegai had pierced his chest,
As he fought hand to hand.
These ‘Murungus’ coming from the west,
Unwelcomed in Black’s land.
Proud medals from some distant war,
His life’s worth left to show,
Reminders of campaigns of yore,
Fought for a land… he’d never know."
1626,Emotion,SoldierPoemsTheSoldierBoyLiesDyingPoembyScarlettTreat,"The Militant Soldier Boy
Lies dying. In shame,
His body lies in disgrace,
Because he could no longer face
The Innocents.
The Innocents, the ones who died
At his hand in that foreign land.
He saw them in his dreams.
He saw them when he was awake,
Or walking about his hometown,
His place of safety, his refuge.
They stood beside him
At the altar
Of his church,
And when he was at work,
Until he could no longer face
The Innocents.
And so, with his Soldier Boy's
Tattered Honor gathered about him,
His heart gave a sigh.
He decided he must die,
Shamed and alone,
Like the Innocents.
Dedicated to all soldiers who must live with the horror of death.

You can leave 'im at night on a bald man's 'ead, to paddle 'is own canoe --
'E's a sort of a bloomin' cosmopolouse -- soldier an' sailor too.
We've fought 'em in trooper, we've fought 'em in dock,
and drunk with 'em in betweens,
When they called us the seasick scull'ry-maids,
an' we called 'em the Ass Marines;
But, when we was down for a double fatigue, from Woolwich to Bernardmyo,
We sent for the Jollies -- 'Er Majesty's Jollies -- soldier an' sailor too!
They think for 'emselves, an' they steal for 'emselves,
and they never ask what's to do,
But they're camped an' fed an' they're up an' fed before our bugle's blew.
Ho! they ain't no limpin' procrastitutes -- soldier an' sailor too.
You may say we are fond of an 'arness-cut, or 'ootin' in barrick-yards,
Or startin' a Board School mutiny along o' the Onion Guards;
But once in a while we can finish in style for the ends of the earth to view,
The same as the Jollies -- 'Er Majesty's Jollies -- soldier an' sailor too!
They come of our lot, they was brothers to us;
they was beggars we'd met an' knew;
Yes, barrin' an inch in the chest an' the arm, they was doubles o' me an' you;
For they weren't no special chrysanthemums -- soldier an' sailor too!
To take your chance in the thick of a rush, with firing all about,
Is nothing so bad when you've cover to 'and, an' leave an' likin' to shout;
But to stand an' be still to the ~Birken'ead~ drill
is a damn tough bullet to chew,
An' they done it, the Jollies -- 'Er Majesty's Jollies --
soldier an' sailor too!
Their work was done when it 'adn't begun; they was younger nor me an' you;
Their choice it was plain between drownin' in 'eaps
an' bein' mopped by the screw,
So they stood an' was still to the ~Birken'ead~ drill, soldier an' sailor too!
We're most of us liars, we're 'arf of us thieves,
an' the rest are as rank as can be,
But once in a while we can finish in style
(which I 'ope it won't 'appen to me).
But it makes you think better o' you an' your friends,
an' the work you may 'ave to do,
When you think o' the sinkin' ~Victorier~'s Jollies -- soldier an' sailor too!
Now there isn't no room for to say ye don't know --
they 'ave proved it plain and true --
That whether it's Widow, or whether it's ship, Victorier's work is to do,
An' they done it, the Jollies -- 'Er Majesty's Jollies --
soldier an' sailor too!"
1630,Emotion,SoldierPoemsTheSoldierPoembyBillSimmons,"As the silence fell,  the birds began to sing
The soldier tries to stand on his own
As the blood trickles down his arm he looks and he see's
As he stands,  he finds he's all alone
His friends are all about him at his feet
The enemy has perished from the seige
From the field of battle he searches the fields and trees
With a sigh of relief he drops down to one knee
With one good hand he fumbles his radio
Must get command on line, must let them know
He hears a voice on line that says Bravo twenty three
Report your twenty and status would you please
The soldier leans his back against a tree
And streaches out before him his tired feet
He says, Sir, the positions held, it is ours to keep
Defended now by one beneath this tree
The voice it says that help is on the way
The soldier hesitates,  as a breath he takes
Across his legs he lays his rifle down
Chambers a round, then comes back to say
Sir, I see a dozen men they come
I'll try to hold this ground but I'm just one
I'll try to hold them back, but I don't think I may
When you come Sir, Please, pray my soul to take
When the help it came they found beneath the tree
The young man in his twentys no longer breathed
And out before him scattered on the ground
Were a  dozen men,  dead enemy were found
The Captain he walks up to the tree
The soldier's hand was warm he finds heartbeat
He said men if you can, you must try to save this man
And they did, for this soldier he was me."
1631,Emotion,SoldierPoemsTheUnknownSoldierByBillyRosePoembyEmilyMoralez,"There's a graveyard near the White House
Where the Unknown Soldier lies,
And the flowers there are sprinkled
With the tears from mother's eyes.
I stood there not so long ago
With roses for the brave,
And suddenly I heard a voice
Speak from out the grave:
'I am the Unknown Soldier,
The spirit voice began
'And I think I have the right
To ask some questions man to man.
'Are my buddies taken care of?
Was their victory so sweet?
Is that big reward you offered
Selling pencils on the street?
'Did they really win the freedom
They battled to achieve?
Do you still respect that Croix de Guerre
Above that empty sleeve?
'Does a gold star in the window
Now mean anything at all?
I wonder how my old girl feels
When she hears a bugle call.
'And that baby who sang
Hello, Central, give me no man
Can they replace her daddy
With a military band?
'I wonder if the profiteers
Have satisfied their greed?
I wonder if a soldier's mother
Ever is in need?
'I wonder if the kings, who planned it all
Are really satisfied?
They played their game of checkers
And eleven million died.
'I am the Unknown Soldier
And maybe I died in vain,
But if I were alive and my country called,
I'd do it all over again."
1632,Emotion,SoldierPoemsAdieuToASoldierPoembyWaltWhitman,"ADIEU, O soldier!
You of the rude campaigning, (which we shared,)
The rapid march, the life of the camp,
The hot contention of opposing fronts- the long manoeuver,
Red battles with their slaughter,- the stimulus- the strong, terrific
game,
Spell of all brave and manly hearts- the trains of Time through you,
and like of you, all fill'd,
With war, and war's expression.
Adieu, dear comrade!
Your mission is fulfill'd- but I, more warlike,
Myself, and this contentious soul of mine,                         10
Still on our own campaigning bound,
Through untried roads, with ambushes, opponents lined,
Through many a sharp defeat and many a crisis- often baffled,
Here marching, ever marching on, a war fight out- aye here,
To fiercer, weightier battles give expression."
1633,Emotion,SoldierPoemsFashionSoldierPoembyDmitriyKokarev,"So softly you apply your mask
Your lipstick, pencil and your brush
How holy seems the dress
Such price could not be but divine
You strap on the heels of pride
And clip on the jewels
You lace your neck with silk
You tighten the leather round your waist
What’s left? Oh yes the weapon
Marc Jacobs’ purse seems heavy right?
Ammunition in it weighs it down!
The Prada shades that block the envy
The Gucci wallet of safe sex
An imitation of Christ gloves
Armani scarf to cover up the age
Along with Donna Karen’s watch to stay on track
You can’t afford to spend your time
Well every second has its price
What else is there behind this soldier on the field?
The Valentino jacket fits just right
Along with YSL blouse and D&G denim
Who ever said this war was easy?
Before you hit the battlefield
You smoothly play the film inside your head
Oh yes, off course
How could you forget the Channel keychain
No soldier can survive without their fancy tank
The Fendi bag of extra outfits can’t look good in just a car
Without the Bentley logo, it just won’t work
Well now it seems that you are ready
To strike and conquer
The hearts and lives of all the enemies ahead
But what is it that slowly makes its way down your cheek?
Have you finally come down to your senses?
And see that all these tags won’t make you happy
That the innocence you sold will not be in next season
And that the one who couldn’t win it
Lost it to the one who bought it with his card!
So are you sick of hiding behind the vanity
Behind the pretense and betrayal
Sick of covering your wounds
And powdering your scabs
Hoping that no one sees
What’s hidden behind your glittered eye
Now wait a second
The Prada shades are slowly making their way off
And well…
How silly of me?
It’s just the MAC eyeliner
And the heavy tone of powder
Have somehow managed to get in your eye
The soldier never goes down easy
She’ll never step down from the cloud
Would you? She asks with sarcasm and a smirk
Would I? I wonder…?"
1634,Emotion,SoldierPoemsTheUnknownSoldierPoembyAngelaMorgan,"He is known to the sun-white Majesties
Who stand at the gates of dawn.
He is known to the cloud-borne company
Whose souls but late have gone.
Like wind-flung stars through lattice bars
They throng to greet their own,
With voice of flame they sound his name
Who died to us unknown.
He is hailed by the time-crowned brotherhood,
By the Dauntless of Marathon,
By Raymond, Godfrey and Lion Heart
Whose dreams he carried on.
His name they call through the heavenly hall
Unheard by earthly ear,
He is claimed by the famed in Arcady
Who knew no title here.
Oh faint was the lamp of Sirius
And dim was the Milky Way.
Oh far was the floor of Paradise
From the soil where the soldier lay.
Oh chill and stark was the crimson dark
Where huddled men lay deep;
His comrades all denied his call
Long had they lain in sleep.
Oh strange how the lamp of Sirius
Drops low to the dazzled eyes,
Oh strange how the steel-red battlefields
Are floors of Paradise.
Oh strange how the ground with never a sound
Swings open, tier on tier,
And standing there in the shining air
Are the friends he cherished here.
They are known to the sun-shod sentinels
Who circle the morning's door,
They are led by a cloud-bright company
Through paths unseen before.
Like blossoms blown, their souls have flown
Past war and reeking sod,
In the book unbound their names are found
They are known in the courts of God!"
1635,Emotion,SoldierPoemsATaleFromAUnionSoldierPoembyJeffFleischer,"I was a Union soldier.
The battles were long, bloody and tiring.
I often had streaks of blood
All over my uniform.
At times I would feel down.
Really down and depressed,
Full of despair and gloom.
But one time, this family took me in
When I was wounded at Gettysburg.
They pretty much saved my life.
They saved me from dying on the road.
Their little boy would look in
On me with his big bright blue eyes.
He always shared his iced tea with me.
I would watch him rock back and forth
On his wooden horse,
Amazed at how the years had gone by
Since my own childhood.
I went back to visit the family
After the war.
I was saddened to find out
That the little boy had died.
Scarlet fever just up and got him.
A lump formed in my throat,
My heart felt like it had been crushed.
I just cried and cried.
I felt I could almost drown
In all those tears.
Every time I drink some cool iced tea
I remember that little boy."

Wait with the Drunks and the Addicts to.
No Uniform please in case it offends?

The only ones who could understand.
Those who shared all the Trauma and Hardships,
The Dangers the Blood and the Fear.

How lonely you feel with no one to share.
With no one to listen and no one to care,
About all of the things you saw while out there.

At Buckingham Palace no less.
In London today and feeling so proud,

Gets told to leave at one Famous Store,
“In case Uniform offends.”
For Queen and Country and a grateful Nation,
The Recruitment Sergeant said.
It’s nice to be back home again,
Where the Uniform offends.
Just home from War,
Broken, bruised, battered and scarred by horrors he has seen,
Now he’s back home and the Uniform offends? ? ? ?
Now that’s offensive to me.
Don’t agree with the War, that’s a point of view,
If you’re in the Armed Forces you go were you’re told.
Those who have Served deserve better than this,
Respect and care at the very least.
Welcome home Soldier from a Grateful Nation."

Computer games with deadly assassins
Whom the mother had tenderly raised
Freedom to whom a cherished possession
Waiting family and children's kiss
Hell bound knows his Miss
Empire is won who counts the men
Lost in flag spots reddened with blood
Makeshift homes that shall care the wound
Cold wind hot and glazing sun
Hit the stones he misses the chance
Knows he killed a dozen in cross

Track a mine or watch the enemy
Neither winner nor looser
He pulls out the picture of his little daughter

There is no rest in your soft bed.
Images of death reveal.
The guilt you hide, but feel.
A war of shadows.
Where you once fought.
In back gardens where children play
For only peace you wished and sought.
The grass green hills of your childhood remain.
But there, there was no death sign
Wife and kids you greet at garden gate.
They don’t see your inner hate.
They don’t see your embroiled conscience,
or know the infliction you bare.
They’re only too happy to have you home.
Home to love and share.
You are a soldier home.
A soldier home from a war,
Trying your guilt to hide.
Trying to forget the child you shot, that died.
The war was someone else’s.
Why should you really care?
It only really strikes home,
when you see a child dying there.
Visions cloud your mind of voices in despair.
Why did we have to die so young?
Why did our mother’s have to mourn?
Soldier from another land, please tell us why?
The soldier’s forehead frowns.
The answer he can not give.
He was only sent there.
So other have a chance to live.
Now his war is over.
Over his home he now resides.
But the voices of despair.
Still ring in his head.
He cries to himself in silence.
How can his conscience bare.
The purgatory it must go through.
Knowing he killed a child fair.

Hush for him, hus, be still!
He comes, who was stricken down
Doing the word of our will.
Hush! Let him have his state,
Give him his soldier's crown.
The grists of trade can wait
Their grinding at the mill,
But he cannot wait for his honor, now the trumpet has been blown.
Wreathe pride now for his granite brow, lay love on his breast of stone.
Toll! Let the great bells toll
Till the clashing air is dim.
Did we wrong this parted soul?
We will make it up to him.
Toll! Let him never guess
What work we set him to.
Laurel, laurel, yes;
He did waht we bade him do.
Praise, and never a whispered hint but the fight he fought was good;
Never a word that the blood on his sword was his country's own heart's-blood.
A flag for the soldier's bier
Who dies that his land may live;
O, banners, banners here,
That he doubt not nor misgive!
That he heed not from the tomb
The evil days draw near
When the nation, robed in gloom,
With its faithless past shall strive.
Let him never dream that his bullet's scream went wide of its island mark,
Home to the heart of his darling land where she stumbled and sinned in the dark."

UNKNOWN SOLDIER
“Where have all the soldiers gone, ”
“Gone to graveyards everyone; ”
Peter Seeger’s sung melodies...
A grieving mother’s sad memories.
Our mother’s sons gone to war,
Repeated untold times before,
Gone to fight for kith and kin,
Each mother’s heart broken within.
Waiting for that ‘gram’ to arrive,
Your son is not coming home alive;
'Your son is missing presumed dead',
That is how those telegrams read.
Now buried deep, so far from home
Beneath some foreign turf and loam.
A Bayoneted rifle marks the hamlet,
Atop the butt, a mangled helmet,
No ‘dog tags’, neck laced identity,
An unmarked grave… for eternity.
Where is the sanity of it all,
Where is the sense of it all,
“When will we ever learn,
When… will we ever learn.”

As in season of autumn.
The soldier falls.
He does not become a three-days personage.
Imposing his separation,
Calling for pomp.
Death is absolute and without memorial,
As in a season of autumn,
When the wind stops,
When the wind stops and, over the heavens,
The clouds go, nevertheless,
In their direction."

Is his delight.
Where maxims pour
Their thudding lead
Upon the ground
And on the shore.
He revels in the sound,
And lies among the dead.
Here where the sniper lies
Beneath the skies
In hungry wait;
And gasping shells
Disgorge red death.
This is his fate:
To love war’s rhythmic breath,
And war’s discordant knells.
Here on the parapet
His foes he met.
See where they sleep
In battered lines.
Here lies his bed
So long and deep,
And on his broken head
A shaft from Heaven shines."

Sacrifice for his world.
Ode to his Mother for while
She lives, the grief and sadness
Take their toll on her mind, as
She goes throughout her day,
Answering questions like “are
You ok? ” and “where is your
Son, I haven’t seen him for a while? ”
She always answers, “yes I’m fine”
Or, “he’s away.” But she knows, inside,
She can’t deny.
Ode to the son he left behind,
For he will grow up without
Knowing who his father is,
Only what he’s done. Never
Will he play catch in the yard,
Like the neighbors next door.
Never will he hear that “Man to
Man” talk, that all boys should.
Ode to the music that will never
Be heard, for the only music
He made, rests in his heart.
Ode to the art that will never be
Seen, for the only art he made,
Remains in a box underground.
Ode to the Fallen Soldier, who
Died so we could live, the way
All mankind should, happy and free."

That there's some corner of a foreign field
That is for ever England. There shall be
In that rich earth a richer dust concealed;
A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,
Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam,
A body of England's, breathing English air,
Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.
And think, this heart, all evil shed away,
A pulse in the eternal mind, no less
Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given;
Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;
And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness,
In hearts at peace, under an English heaven."

1651,Emotion,SoldierPoemsADyingSoldierPoembyJosephTRenaldi,"A soldier was ordered into battle to face the foe,
His mind  devoid of sensation - his body numb,
And his rifle fixed with a bayonet in front of him,
Charged the rampart hoping the conflict is won.
His fate is dependent upon the success of the mission,
The mark of death had been cast upon his head,
Severely wounded by an unrelenting hostility
On the battlefield where his body profusely bled
No more transitory orders - no more fighting,
No longer can be heard the eerie sound of artillery,
Only a mumbling of words - crying out in pain,
Hallucinating of love ones vague and dreary.
Shortly he will succumb from his ghastly wounds
In a hostile and foreign land across the vast sea.
Though he is dead - his spirit will live on forever,
His body to be buried in his hometown's cemetery.
The sound of TAPS on a bugle is heard  nearby,
Symbolic of death for his country with the highest laud.
The Chaplain says a final prayer- many tears are shed
As the soldier's body is laid to rest beneath the sod.
An important question is still to be answered,
' Why was this soldier chosen to die on foreign soil? '"

Days of danger, nights of waking.

Hands unseen thy couch are strewing,
Fairy strains of music fall,
Every sense in slumber dewing.
Soldier, rest! thy warfare o'er,
Dream of fighting fields no more:
Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking,
Morn of toil, nor night of waking.
No rude sound shall reach thine ear,
Armour's clang, or war-steed champing,
Trump nor pibroch summon here
Mustering clan, or squadron tramping.
Yet the lark's shrill fife may come
At the day-break from the fallow,
And the bittern sound his drum,
Booming from the sedgy shallow.
Ruder sounds shall none be near,
Guards nor warders challenge here,
Here's no war-steed's neigh and champing,
Shouting clans or squadrons stamping.
Huntsman, rest! thy chase is done,
While our slumbrous spells assail ye,
Dream not, with the rising sun,
Bugles here shall sound reveillé.
Sleep! the deer is in his den;
Sleep! thy hounds are by thee lying;
Sleep! nor dream in yonder glen,
How thy gallant steed lay dying.
Huntsman, rest; thy chase is done,

For at dawning to assail ye,
Here no bugles sound reveillé."

weary soldiers are huddled behind church doors,
reminiscing about the recent past with outlook bleak -
Not knowing that Life can offer so much more.
Military plans for Earth's invasion
are held by the Kingdom priests,
trying to comprehend the message of scriptural persuasion
for bringing captive lives to Godly release.
Between berating and war counsel cries,
there are mixed signals being presented.
Separating truth from unintentional lies
is a real challenge to our minds and senses.
The battle is not ours to engage,
but we must employ a strategy of Love -
To reach souls without offending on Life's stage
by using wisdom that flows from Heaven above."

Dry leaves, soldier, dry leaves, dead leaves;
voices of leaves on the wind that bears them to
destruction,
impassioned prayer, impassioned hymn of delight
of the gladly doomed to die. Stridor of beasts,
stridor of men, praises of lust and battle,
numberless as waves, the waves singing
to the wind that bears them down.
Under Osiris,
him of the Egyptian priests, Osynmandyas the King,
easward into Asia we passed, swarmed over Bactria,
three thousand years before Christ.
The history of war
is the history of mankind.
So many dead:
look at them there in the dark, look at them going,
the longest parade of all, the parade of the dead:
between then and now, seven thousand million dead:
dead on the filed of battle.
The people which is not ready
to guard its gods, and its household gods, with the
sword,
who knows but it will find itself with nothing
save honour to defend - ?
Consider, soldier
whatever name you go by, doughboy, dogface,
marine or tommy. God's mercenary – consider our lot
in the days if the single combat. You have been seen on the
seashore.
In the offshore wind blown backward, a wavecrest
windwhipped and quivering, borne helpless and
briefly
to fall underfoot of an oncoming seawall, foam-
smothered,
once more to recede, wind-thwarted again; thus
deathward
the battle lines whelmed and divided. The darkling
battalions
locked arms in chaos, the bravest, the heroes,
kept in the forefront' and this line once broken,
our army was done for.

the city named for a captain; in the capital:
under the solemn echoing dome, in the still tomb,
lies an unknown soldier.*
In the brown city,
old and shabby, by the muddy Thames, in the gaunt
avenue
where Romans blessed with Latin the oyster and the
primrose,
the stone shaft speaks of another. Those who pass
bare their heads in the rain, pausing to listen+
Across grey water, red poppies on cliffs and chalk.
Hidden under the arch, in the city of light,
the city beloved of Abelard rests a third,
nameless as those, but the fluttering flame
substituting for a name.
Three unknown soldiers:
three, let us say, out of many. On the proud arch
names shine like stars, the names of battles and
victories;
but never the name of the man, you, the unknown.
Down there runs the river, under dark walls of rock,
parapets of rock, stone steps that green to the water.
There they fished up in the twilight another unknown,
the one they call
L'Inconnue de la Seine
: drowned
hands,
drowned hair, drowned eyes, masked like marble she
listens
to the drip-drop secret of silence; and the pale eyelids
enclose and disclose what they know, the illusion
found like fire under Lethe. Devotion here sainted
the love here deathless. The strong purpose turns
from the daggered lamplight, from the little light to
the lesser,
from stone to stone stepping, from the nex-to-the-lasy
heartbeat and footstep even to the sacred, to the last.
Love: devotion: sacrifice: death: can we call her
unknown
who has not unknown to herself more? Whose love
lives still
as if death itself were alive and divine?
And you, the soldier
you who are dead: is it not so with you?
Love: devotion: sacrifice: death: can we call you
unknown,
you who knew what you did? The soldier is crystal:
crystal of man: clear heart, clear duty, clear purpose.
No soldier can be unknown. Only he is unknown
who is unknown to himself."
1655,Emotion,SoldierPoemsDirgeForASoldierPoembyPaulLaurenceDunbar,"In the east the morning comes,
Hear the rollin' of the drums
On the hill.
But the heart that beat as they beat
In the battle's raging day heat
Lieth still.
Unto him the night has come,
Though they roll the morning drum.
What is in the bugle's blast?
It is: 'Victory at last!
Now for rest.'
But, my comrades, come behold him,
Where our colors now enfold him,
And his breast
Bares no more to meet the blade,
But lies covered in the shade.
What a stir there is to-day!
They are laying him away
Where he fell.
There the flag goes draped before him;
Now they pile the grave sod o'er him
With a knell.
And he answers to his name
In the higher ranks of fame.
There's a woman left to mourn
For the child that she has borne
In travail.
But her heart beats high and higher,
With the patriot mother's fire,
At the tale.
She has borne and lost a son,
But her work and his are done.
Fling the flag out, let it wave;
They 're returning from the grave--
'Double quick!'
And the cymbals now are crashing,
Bright his comrades' eyes are flashing
From the thick
Battle-ranks which knew him brave,
No tears for a hero's grave.
In the east the morning comes,
Hear the rattle of the drums
Far away.
Now no time for grief's pursuing,
Other work is for the doing,
Here to-day.
He is sleeping, let him rest
With the flag across his breast."
1656,Emotion,SoldierPoemsGirlToASoldierOnLeavePoembyIsaacRosenberg,"Girl To A Soldier On Leave
Love! You love me — your eyes
Have looked through death at mine.
You have tempted a grave too much
I let you — I repine.
I love you - Titan lover,
My own storm-days Titan.
Greater than the son of Zeus,
I know whom I would choose.
Titan — my splendid rebel —
The old Prometheus
Wanes like a ghost before your power —
His pangs were joys to yours.
Pallid days arid and wan
Tied your soul fast.
Babel-cities smoky tops
Pressed upon your growth
Weary gyves. What were you
But a word in the brains ways,
Or the sleep of Circes swine.
One gyve holds you yet.
It held you hiddenly on the Somme
Tied from my heart at home.
O must it loosen now? — I wish
You were bound with the old gyves.
Love! you love me — your eyes
Have looked through death at mine.
You have tempted a grave too much.
I let you - I repine."

Salutations to Soldiers
July 17,2009"
1658,Emotion,SoldierPoemsTheSoldierPoembyJohnClare,"Home furthest off grows dearer from the way;
And when the army in the Indias lay
Friends' letters coming from his native place
Were like old neighbours with their country face.
And every opportunity that came
Opened the sheet to gaze upon the name
Of that loved village where he left his sheep
For more contented peaceful folk to keep;
And friendly faces absent many a year
Would from such letters in his mind appear.
And when his pockets, chafing through the case,
Wore it quite out ere others took the place,
Right loath to be of company bereft
He kept the fragments while a bit was left."
1659,Emotion,SoldierPoemsAnySoldierToHisSonPoembyAnonymousEnglish,"What did I do, sonny, in the Great World War?
Well, I learned to peel potatoes and to scrub the barrack floor.
I learned to push a barrow and I learned to swing a pick,
I learned to turn my toes out, and to make my eyeballs click.
I learned the road to Folkestone, and I watched the English shore,
Go down behind the skyline, as I thought, for evermore.
And the Blighty boats went by us and the harbour hove in sight,
And they landed us and sorted us and marched us ""by the right"".
""Quick march!"" across the cobbles, by the kids who rang along
Singing ""Appoo?"" ""Spearmant"" ""Shokolah?"" through dingy old Boulogne;
By the widows and the nurses and the niggers and Chinese,
And the gangs of smiling Fritzes, as saucy as you please.
I learned to ride as soldiers ride from Etaps to the Line,
For days and nights in cattle trucks, packed in like droves of swine.
I learned to curl and kip it on a foot of muddy floor,
And to envy cows and horses that have beds of beaucoup straw.
I learned to wash in shell holes and to shave myself in tea,
While the fragments of a mirror did a balance on my knee.
I learned to dodge the whizz-bangs and the flying lumps of lead,
And to keep a foot of earth between the sniper and my head.
I learned to keep my haversack well filled with buckshee food,
To take the Army issue and to pinch what else I could.
I learned to cook Maconochie with candle-ends and string,
With ""four-by-two"" and sardine-oil and any God-dam thing.
I learned to use my bayonet according as you please
For a breadknife or a chopper or a prong for toasting cheese.
I learned ""a first field dressing"" to serve my mate and me
As a dish-rag and a face-rag and a strainer for our tea.
I learned to gather souvenirs that home I hoped to send,
And hump them round for months and months and dump them in the end.
I learned to hunt for vermin in the lining of my shirt,
To crack them with my finger-nail and feel the beggars spirt;
I learned to catch and crack them by the dozen and the score
And to hunt my shirt tomorrow and to find as many more.
I learned to sleep by snatches on the firestep of a trench,
And to eat my breakfast mixed with mud and Fritz's heavy stench.
I learned to pray for Blighty ones and lie and squirm with fear,
When Jerry started strafing and the Blighty ones were near.
I learned to write home cheerful with my heart a lump of lead
With the thought of you and mother, when she heard that I was dead.
And the only thing like pleasure over there I ever knew,
Was to hear my pal come shouting, ""There's a parcel, mate, for you.""
So much for what I did do - now for what I have not done:
Well, I never kissed a French girl and I never killed a Hun,
I never missed an issue of tobacco, pay, or rum,
I never made a friend and yet I never lacked a chum.
I never borrowed money, and I never lent - but once
(I can learn some sorts of lessons though I may be borne a dunce).
I never used to grumble after breakfast in the Line
That the eggs were cooked too lightly or the bacon cut too fine.
I never told a sergeant just exactly what I thought,
I never did a pack-drill, for I never quite got caught.
I never punched a Red-Cap's nose (be prudent like your Dad),
But I'd like as many sovereigns as the times I've wished I had.
I never stopped a whizz-bang, though I've stopped a lot of mud,
But the one that Fritz sent over with my name on was a dud.
I never played the hero or walked about on top,
I kept inside my funk hole when the shells began to drop.
Well, Tommy Jones's father must be made of different stuff:
I never asked for trouble - the issue was enough.
So I learned to live and lump it in the lovely land of war,
Where the face of nature seems a monstrous septic sore,
Where the bowels of earth of earth hang open, like the guts of something slain,
And the rot and wreck of everything are churned and churned again;
Where all is done in darkness and where all is still in day,
Where living men are buried and the dead unburied lay;
Where men inhabit holes like rats, and only rats live there;
Where cottage stood and castle once in days before La Guerre;
Where endless files of soldiers thread the everlasting way,
By endless miles of duckboards, through endless walls of clay;
Where life is one hard labour, and a soldiers gets his rest
When they leave him in the daisies with a puncture in his chest;
Where still the lark in summer pours her warble from the skies,
And underneath, unheeding, lie the blank upstaring eyes.
And I read the Blighty papers, where the warriors of the pen
Tell of ""Christmas in the trenches"" and ""The Spirit of our men"";
And I saved the choicest morsels and I read them to my chum,
And he muttered, as he cracked a louse and wiped it off his thumb:
""May a thousand chats from Belgium crawl under their fingers as they write;
May they dream they're not exempted till they faint with mortal fright;
May the fattest rats in Dickebusch race over them in bed;
May the lies they've written choke them like a gas cloud till they're dead;
May the horror and the torture and the things they never tell
(For they only write to order) be reserved for them in Hell!""
You'd like to be a soldier and go to France some day?
By all the dead in Delville Wood, by all the nights I lay
Between our lines and Fritz's before they brought me in;
By this old wood-and-leather stump, that once was flesh and skin;
By all the lads who crossed with me but never crossed again,
By all the prayers their mothers and their sweethearts prayed in vain,
Before the things that were that day should ever more befall
May God in common pity destroy us one and all!"
1660,Emotion,SoldierPoemsIAmARomanSoldierPoembyJosiahWedgewood,"I am a Roman soldier.
I choke on the dust and peer ahead.
There are only more soldiers and more marching.
The sun gleams from shields slung over the backs of my comrades
and our swords clank at our sides.
Only three weeks into the Germania campaign
and the Senate still favors the Brutii.
Still, General Augustus favors blood,
and so we march.
I am a Roman soldier and I fight for Rome and for glory.
My javelins tangle and I stop to adjust them.
Their one-use tips were digging in my back.
Feet continue to march past and I smell sweat and dirt.
There are murmurs of conversation
About the last town we sacked.
About the screams and the blood,
and how the Armenians would rather fight
then submit to Roman power.
I am a Roman soldier.
I grew up in Croton, a large town South of Rome.
My mother weaved cloth for the governor,
the white and green of the Brutii.
They claim they first settled Rome,
Their ancestor is Brutus, survivor of Troy
relation of the great Romulus.
My father was a proud Brutii
and his eyes sparkled at the name.
“Brutus, ” he said, “started this family with honor
and with honor died.”
Then two weeks passed,
and he died at Carthage.
I am a Roman soldier and I fight for Rome.
I pretend to inspect my shield as legions pass.
A Centurion calls for water and boasts
“It’s not to drink but to wipe off barbarian blood! ”
We Romans are tough and mighty
and will rule the world with Strength and Honor
There’s a problem with a leather strap
and I listen to the pounding feet.
I saw blood splattered on many.
Dried and brown.
I am a Roman soldier.
My mother’s voice rings in my head,
“Come back with your shield, or upon it.”
I wonder if my blood will be dried
and brown on someone’s feet some day.
I shake off the thought and raise my head.
The wind stirs my hair.
With it comes the rumble of cavalry.
The General will meet with us tonight.
Tomorrow we lay siege.
He had said we will do great things,
and that neither cities nor hordes could stop us.
We will live in glory and there will be songs about us
sung through the ages.
I am a Roman soldier and I am sick of fighting.
The army surges ahead and I watch it.
Shimmering and moving with a rhythm.
Thousands of blades of grass tossed by the wind.
The cavalry comes neatly alongside;
loud voices ring out in greeting.
I sigh and heft my shield,
Don my helmet and check my sword.
I fight because I have to,
I fight because the world would not have it otherwise,
The world could not stand to have one less of me,
I am a Roman soldier."
1661,Emotion,SoldierPoemsSoldierGoingToTheWarPoembyRichardLeGallienne,"Soldier going to the war--
Will you take my heart with you,
So that I may share a little
In the famous things you do?
Soldier going to the war--
If in battle you must fall,
Will you, among all the faces,
See my face the last of all?
Soldier coming from the war--
Who shall bind your sunburnt brow
With the laurel of the hero,
Soldier, soldier--vow for vow!
Soldier coming from the war--
When the street is one wide sea,
Flags and streaming eyes and glory--
Soldier, will you look for me?"

to protect some place,
that was never my own.
I was the perfect soldier,
until he came along,
and ruined it forever.
He was my celestial soldier,
he was my first true love.
Milady Fate has a cruel side.
She ripped us apart forever,
so I became what I hated,
the perfect soldier once more.
So in the end I have become,
My own Celestial soldier,
for I can never have my own again."

And I am all alone
I look up at the sky
And remember you are gone
Gone from this place
Where I am at now
Gone to a place
That I disavow
It’s hot and sandy
I never want to go
It’s far and distant
I will never fully know
When I get a call
Few and far between
You have to watch what you say
For reasons left unseen
I don’t know what you’re doing
Or where you are at.
I don’t know who your with
Are you somewhere in combat?
I want you here with me
I want you by my side
I want you for my self
This feeling I will not hide
There is so much you are missing
With our little girl
You’ve never even seen
Her cute little curl
Somewhere in Iraq
Fighting in their war
Is my loving husband
Of whom I most adore
Months go by
Time fades away
My love grows stronger
Each and everyday
My husband, my soldier
My hero, my friend
I love you right now
I love you till the end
Before we even know it
You will be home
In this place together
We will forever roam
My husband, my soldier
My hero, my friend
You and me together
Our love will transcend

1665,Emotion,SoldierPoemssoldierThinksHesNotButHesHotPoembySylviSylva,"He thinks he’s not, but he’s hot!
Deeply clumsy, dartful smiley eyes… a playful child
The tainted gun, the spilt paint, oh! the tears, the loss
The pain in his eyes…the story of his life….bloody, wild
Soldier smiles with broken bones, for happiness sought
Who wouldn’t, with the battles he’s fought?
He thinks he’s not, but he’s hot!
He laughs at himself, nonchalantly guilty, spins a silly joke
He won’t break but falls over to prop you up, if twice over, you see
He’s no fool, though he would be to make you laugh, he’ll even shock
Soldier blushes when you tell him, for he wouldn’t agree
Who wouldn’t see it, but a shy girl like me, high on the rooftop?

The soldier fights for good,
The soldier fights against evil.

Good fights with the soldier,
The people help the soldier.
The soldier fights for the Politicians,

The soldier fights for his religion.

The country supports his strength,
His religion holds him back."
1667,Emotion,SoldierPoemsTheSoldierBirdsPoembyHenryLawson,"I mind the river from Mount Frome
To Ballanshantie’s Bridge,
The Mudgee Hills, and Buckaroo,
Lowe’s Peak, and Granite Ridge.
The “tailers” in the creek beneath,
The rugged she-oak boles,
The river cod where shallows linked,
The willowed water-holes.
I mind the blacksoil river flats,
The red soil levels, too,
The sidings where below the scrub
The golden wattles grew;
The track that ran by Tierney’s Gap,
The dusk and ghost alarms,
The glorious morning on the hills,
And all the German farms.
I mind the blue-grey gully bush,
The slab-and-shingle school,
The “soldier birds” that picked the crumbs
Beneath the infants’ stool.
(Ah! did those little soldier birds,
That whispered, ever know
That one of us should rise so high
And sadly sink so low?)
I mind the lessons that we droned
In books from Irish schools,
The canings and the keepings-in
For breaking bounds and rules.
Ah! little did the teacher dream
That one of us, perchance,
Might write in London to be read
In Germany and France.
I mind the days we played at camp
With billy-can and swag,
I mind the notes sent home by girls
When someone “played the wag.”
Ah! little did the master think
(Who’d lost the roving star)
What truants in their after years
Would play the wag so far.
I mind when first he gave to me
A pen and ink to write,
And, last, the “Fourth Class Forms” he made
I shared with Lucy White.
The other boys were other boys,
With cricket ball and bat,
They had a fine contempt for girls,
But they got over that.
The “rounders” where the girls came in—
The Tomboy and the rest—
The earnest game of Pris’ners’ Base—
The game that I liked best.
The kangarooing on the ridge,
And in the brown moonlight,
The “possuming” across the flats,
With dogs and gun at night.
The “specking” in old diggers’ heaps
For “colours” after rain,
The horse-shoes saved against the time
The circus came again,
And sold to Jimmy Siver-right—
The blacksmith on the flat;
The five-corners, the swimming hole—
Oh! I remember that!
I mind the holland “dinner bags”—
A book bag of green baize—
The bread and dripping, bread and meat,
And bread and treacle days.
The bread and butter swopped for meat,
The crumb we swopped for crust—
We’ve married—and divorced—since then,
And most old homes are dust.
It was the time, it was the place—
Australia’s hardest page—
When boys were cast for farming work
At fourteen years of age.
It was the time, it was the place,
The latter “Early Day,”
When boys ride home from old bark schools
And to the world away.
I’ve drifted through Port Said since then,
Naples and Leicester Square,
And Collins and Macquarie Streets—
I know the secrets there.
Ah me! The country boy and girl,
The country lass and lad,
As innocent as soldier birds,
Though we thought we were bad!
But, spite of all their daring truth,
And some work that shall last,
The bitter years of my brave youth
Are better in the past.
This does not call for bitterness,
Nor does it call for tears,
The purest little thing perhaps
I’ve printed here for years.
The railway runs by Mudgee Hills,
Old farms are lost or lone,
And children’s children sadly go
To schools of brick and stone.
Yet are the same. The Mudgee Hills
And Mudgee skies as fair—
And the little grey-clad soldier birds
Are just as busy there."

So here's me once more at large in
Bay-street, Port, a bloomin' Sargin'.
“Cri, it jumbo.” “Have a beer.”
“Wot-o, Anzac; you're a dear.”

“'Ello, soldier, howja do?”
Back at Grillo's where the nigger googs his

Dancin' glad attendance on yeh 'zif yeh was

Where the smart procession goes,

Blowin' out me pout a little, chattin' wide 'n'

Got the tag iv plate to tell;
Square Gallipoli surviver,
With a touch iv Colonel's guyver.

“Soldier, soldier, you're the one!”
Back again, a wounded hero, moochin' up 'n'

Feelin' 'sthough I'd got a fond arf-Nelson on

Never was so gay, so 'elp me, never felt so

Fresh from 'ell a paradise ain't very hard to

After filth, 'n' flies, 'n' slaughter
Fat brown babies in the water,
Singin' people on the sand
Makes a boshter Happy Land!
War what toughened hone 'n' hide
Turned a feller soft inside!

My soul made of fire and my heart of stone
I have no pain, ignoring all that I feel
With bones of iron and nerves of steel
This is what I portray, fooling you all
My emotions so strong, my defenses so tall
But inside I'm weak, having unsettled war
Not knowing why I battle or what this is for
This war is unending and cease fires are few
No shots are heard but damage is true
What is going on here, what is this for
I'm a lone soldier in a private war"
1671,Emotion,SoldierPoemsTheYoungBritishSoldierPoembyRudyardKipling,"When the 'arf-made recruity goes out to the East
'E acts like a babe an' 'e drinks like a beast,
An' 'e wonders because 'e is frequent deceased
Ere 'e's fit for to serve as a soldier.
Serve, serve, serve as a soldier,
Serve, serve, serve as a soldier,
Serve, serve, serve as a soldier,
So-oldier ~OF~ the Queen!
Now all you recruities what's drafted to-day,
You shut up your rag-box an' 'ark to my lay,
An' I'll sing you a soldier as far as I may:
A soldier what's fit for a soldier.
Fit, fit, fit for a soldier . . .
First mind you steer clear o' the grog-sellers' huts,
For they sell you Fixed Bay'nets that rots out your guts --
Ay, drink that 'ud eat the live steel from your butts --
An' it's bad for the young British soldier.
Bad, bad, bad for the soldier . . .
When the cholera comes -- as it will past a doubt --
Keep out of the wet and don't go on the shout,
For the sickness gets in as the liquor dies out,
An' it crumples the young British soldier.
Crum-, crum-, crumples the soldier . . .
But the worst o' your foes is the sun over'ead:
You ~must~ wear your 'elmet for all that is said:
If 'e finds you uncovered 'e'll knock you down dead,
An' you'll die like a fool of a soldier.
Fool, fool, fool of a soldier . . .
If you're cast for fatigue by a sergeant unkind,
Don't grouse like a woman nor crack on nor blind;
Be handy and civil, and then you will find
That it's beer for the young British soldier.
Beer, beer, beer for the soldier . . .
Now, if you must marry, take care she is old --
A troop-sergeant's widow's the nicest I'm told,
For beauty won't help if your rations is cold,
Nor love ain't enough for a soldier.
'Nough, 'nough, 'nough for a soldier . . .
If the wife should go wrong with a comrade, be loath
To shoot when you catch 'em -- you'll swing, on my oath! --
Make 'im take 'er and keep 'er:  that's Hell for them both,
An' you're shut o' the curse of a soldier.
Curse, curse, curse of a soldier . . .
When first under fire an' you're wishful to duck,
Don't look nor take 'eed at the man that is struck,
Be thankful you're livin', and trust to your luck
And march to your front like a soldier.
Front, front, front like a soldier . . .
When 'arf of your bullets fly wide in the ditch,
Don't call your Martini a cross-eyed old bitch;
She's human as you are -- you treat her as sich,
An' she'll fight for the young British soldier.
Fight, fight, fight for the soldier . . .
When shakin' their bustles like ladies so fine,
The guns o' the enemy wheel into line,
Shoot low at the limbers an' don't mind the shine,
For noise never startles the soldier.
Start-, start-, startles the soldier . . .
If your officer's dead and the sergeants look white,
Remember it's ruin to run from a fight:
So take open order, lie down, and sit tight,
And wait for supports like a soldier.
Wait, wait, wait like a soldier . . .
When you're wounded and left on Afghanistan's plains,
And the women come out to cut up what remains,
Jest roll to your rifle and blow out your brains
An' go to your Gawd like a soldier.
Go, go, go like a soldier,
Go, go, go like a soldier,

1672,Emotion,SoldierPoemsTheDyingSoldierPoembyAnonymousAmericas,"Yes! raise me on your arm, Dick Dale,
My comrade old and true.
And let me of the glad earth take
One last and lingering view.
When yet a few brief moments more
Of this flittering hour have fled,
You’ll shed an old friend's tear, Dick Dale,
Above your comrade's head.
We fought together, side by side,
In many a bloody fray,
From Malvern Hill's dark hour of strife,
To fierce Antietam's day.
And when again the 'long roll' calls,
For battle to prepare,
You will not fail the flag, Dick Dale,
But I shall not be there.
You will not soon forget me, Dick!
I know it by that sigh;
I know it by those tears that shine
In your half averted eye.
But my dear old comrade's heart will swell,
I know with honest pride,
When he thinks that for the grand old flag,
His old companion died.
Cut off this light brown lock, Dick Dale,
For the girl that waits at home.
Yes! Hoping waits her soldier love,
Who never more can come.
'Twill soothe perhaps her bleeding heart
To know that watched by you,
The boy she loved, at least has died,
With one who loved him too.
You'll visit all the quaint old nooks
We sought when we were boys,
And thoughts of me will come, Dick Dale,
With thoughts of childhood's joys;
And when you reach the old playground
Where once you used to play,
You’ll not forget your friend, Dick Dale,
In his lone grave far away."
1673,Emotion,SoldierPoemsTeacherSoldierWithAPenPoembyDrYogeshSharma,"Teacher is a soldier with a pen and an eternal guide
Lighting wisdom to mind decayed and white,
Floating tirelessly till dark with no pride,
Without fear and favor telling tales bright.
To clean the dirt river flows and air floats,
To vibrate heart and mind he gloats.
‘Tween goddess Sarswati and man he is linking milk,
Giving life to the world with deepest think.
As blessed banyan with roots, side by side,
Withstand winter, storm, wind and tide,
Beauty he admires and goodness wide,
Word and language such as teacher ride,
He will turn dust to gold, if his ways not hide,
And rake a soul with favorite manifold glide.

Not fear your noon or even-fall,
Nor dread you are taken unawares,
Nor weary Heaven with many prayers.
I shall not wake at night afraid
Of where your darling head is laid,
Nor say: 'He finds the wind too rough,
Dear God!' for now the wind's left off.
I shall have ease though lightnings leap,
Nor hear the thunder in my sleep,
Nor dread the crying of the seas,
Nor any mountain precipice.
God pity her who lies awake
Unquiet for some darling sake!
Soft sleeps my little son to-night,
Where many stars make candlelight!
His sword is laid beside his knees;
God knows my little son hath ease --
And I, his mother, may go sleep
And pray for them who wake and weep."

And stood at the Pearly Gates
And asked himself out loudly
'Is this a joke or my fait? '
When St. Peter spoke to him
And said 'Son this is no mistake! '
'You was blown up by a land mine! '
'So welcome to heaven'and offered his hand to shake
'Do you remember the little girl? '
'That you so boldly jumped to save? '
'Well, she was just your bait! '
'And now your body lays in a grave! '
'Oh don't get me wrong! '
'The girl survived just fine'
'Someone put her in that spot '
'Just so you would trip on that mine! '
'Now as far as your family'
'Your wife is pregnant with your son! '
'Your mom and dad are both ill'
'While your brother is out having fun! '
'Do you remember your sweetheart? '
'The one, when you was back in school? '
'Well she also had your son! '
'Now don't you feel just like a fool? '
'Now your buddies in your troop'
'They got the guy who set that mine'
'He fought until he was shot to pieces'
'Aint it ironic, how things work out so fine? '
'You have a few buddies already here'
'Who also died by trial and error'
'But all by the same token'
'You all died, trying to end the world of terror'
'So come on through these pearly gates'
'You might say we've been expecting you! '
'Did you know you are one of the bravest? '
'And let me tell you that is getting very few! '

1681,Emotion,SoldierPoemsNamelessSoldierPoembyDavidHarris,"A bayoneted rifle stuck in the ground
with a soldier’s helmet on it
lies as a marker for a solder buried there
in the haste of battle.
No more will he see the joy again
within his loved ones eyes.
No more will he feel the tears on his cheeks
as they leak down from his eyes.
His is just a lonely grave
that is crying out for a name
like hundreds there with just a rife as a marker.
At home, and mothers weep for their lost sons
who fell before their time
leaving their ghost to roam
across a soon forgotten battlegrounds.
The grave will lay unattended
all the time fighting prevails.
Only a rifle stuck in the ground
will tell all someone is lying there.
The nameless soldier
whose flesh had been torn to shreds
lies silent and at peace
in a land far from his home.

1682,Emotion,SoldierPoemsSoldierBoyPoembyRobertWilliamService,"My soldier boy has crossed the sea
To fight the foeman;
But he'll come back to make of me
And honest woman.
So I am singing all day long,
Despite blood-shedding;
For though I know he's done me wrong,
We'll end by wedding.
My soldier boy is home again,
So bold and scathless;
But oh, my heart is numb with pain
Because he's faithless.
He's brought with him a French Mam'selle;
They plan a marriage;
Maybe I'll go - no one will know
Of my miscarriage.
My soldier boy has made his choice,
She'll hold him to it;
I tell myself that I rejoice,
May he not rue it.
But oh, that starry month of May,
Love-words wild spoken!
I stand alone and make no moan...
My heart is broken."
1683,Emotion,SoldierPoemsTheDumbSoldierPoembyRobertLouisStevenson,"When the grass was closely mown,
Walking on the lawn alone,
In the turf a hole I found
And hid a soldier underground.
Spring and daisies came apace;
Grasses hid my hiding-place;
Grasses run like a green sea
O'er the lawn up to my knee.
Under grass alone he lies,
Looking up with leaden eyes,
Scarlet coat and pointed gun,
To the stars and to the sun.
When the grass is ripe like grain,
When the scythe is stoned again,
When the lawn is shaven clear,
Then my hole shall reappear.
I shall find him, never fear,
I shall find my grenadier;
But, for all that's gone and come,
I shall find my soldier dumb.
He has lived, a little thing,
In the grassy woods of spring;
Done, if he could tell me true,
Just as I should like to do.
He has seen the starry hours
And the springing of the flowers;
And the fairy things that pass
In the forests of the grass.
In the silence he has heard
Talking bee and ladybird,
And the butterfly has flown
O'er him as he lay alone.
Not a word will he disclose,
Not a word of all he knows.
I must lay him on the shelf,
And make up the tale myself."

and realize,
I've been hit,
It's my time to die.
I crawl and heave,
and try to run,
In the passing rays,
of the setting sun.
My arm is wounded,
my leg is broken,
blood is everywhere,
my clothes are soaken.
I try to stand,
but start to fall,
I hear my leaders,
retreating call.
The gun fires stop,
as quickly as they came,
I just want it to end,
the burning pain.
My men, my friends,
I start to cry,
They left me here,
alone to die.
I wander home,
where my song is sung,
I know they'll greive,
for I died to young.
But I'll be here,
For in heaven lays,
the rising sun,
and the new sun rays."

In his hands he holds our lives.
A Brave Soldier he may be, but only at the the front lines.
He is weaken by all the death,
He is haulted by there souls.
For he knows in this battle, hatred rules one's goal.
He does not fight for hatred,
He fights for there lives instead.
Cause he knows hatred has no value, when so many are dead.
As he lays in death, knowing it will come,
He glances at the sky and makes peace with all he's done.
For on the battlefield, life is as precious as gold.
And one must always choose should it be friend or foe?
He closes his eyes and hopes in his death no more victums will fall.
But, in his heart he knows his country one day will call.
For A Brave Soldier to take the front line and give there his life as he,
He just hopes all are content knowing A Brave Soldier he will always be."
1687,Emotion,SoldierPoemsDeathOfASoldierPoembyMamtaAgarwal,"Five years ago, he had joined the IMA*
In the prime of his life, he has gone today
He was injured fighting the militants
His body was ridden with bullets
Nobody would know for sure
What he had to endure
How much it hurt
While the blood spurt
On the barren ground
Where he was groaning, found
I wonder, what went on in his head
While he lay on the hospital bed
What was he thinking?
While he was sinking
Did he in his last moments of strife
Feel he had wasted his life
Fighting a senseless war
While the world watched from afar
Or, did he while breathing his last, feel proud
As they prepared to wrap him in his shroud.
What are we achieving?
While so many families are grieving
Over the loss of their sons’ lives
Some of whom have left behind wailing kids and wives
It’s time we learnt to live in peace
And this cross border tension had ceased.

1688,Emotion,SoldierPoemsTheSoldierOfFortunePoembyRobertWilliamService,"'Deny your God! ' they ringed me with their spears;
Blood-crazed were they, and reeking from the strife;
Hell-hot their hate, and venom-fanged their sneers,
And one man spat on me and nursed a knife.
And there was I, sore wounded and alone,
I, the last living of my slaughtered band.
Oh sinister the sky, and cold as stone!
In one red laugh of horror reeled the land.
And dazed and desperate I faced their spears,
And like a flame out-leaped that naked knife,
And like a serpent stung their bitter jeers:
'Deny your God, and we will give you life.'
Deny my God! Oh life was very sweet!
And it is hard in youth and hope to die;
And there my comrades dear lay at my feet,
And in that blear of blood soon must I lie.
And yet... I almost laughed -  it seemed so odd,
For long and long had I not vainly tried
To reason out and body forth my God,
And prayed for light, and doubted -  and denied:
Denied the Being I could not conceive,
Denied a life-to-be beyond the grave....
And now they ask me, who do not believe,
Just to deny, to voice my doubt, to save
This life of mine that sings so in the sun,
The bloom of youth yet red upon my cheek,
My only life! -  O fools! 'tis easy done,
I will deny... and yet I do not speak.
'Deny your God! ' their spears are all agleam,
And I can see their eyes with blood-lust shine;
Their snarling voices shrill into a scream,
And, mad to slay, they quiver for the sign.
Deny my God! yes, I could do it well;
Yet if I did, what of my race, my name?
How they would spit on me, these dogs of hell!
Spurn me, and put on me the brand of shame.
A white man's honour! what of that, I say?
Shall these black curs cry 'Coward' in my face?
They who would perish for their gods of clay -
Shall I defile my country and my race?
My country! what's my country to me now?
Soldier of Fortune, free and far I roam;
All men are brothers in my heart, I vow;
The wide and wondrous world is all my home.
My country! reverent of her splendid Dead,
Her heroes proud, her martyrs pierced with pain:
For me her puissant blood was vainly shed;
For me her drums of battle beat in vain,
And free I fare, half-heedless of her fate:
No faith, no flag I owe -  then why not seek
This last loop-hole of life? Why hesitate?
I will deny... and yet I do not speak.
'Deny your God! ' their spears are poised on high,
And tense and terrible they wait the word;
And dark and darker glooms the dreary sky,
And in that hush of horror no thing stirred.
Then, through the ringing terror and sheer hate
Leaped there a vision to me -  Oh, how far!
A face, Her face... through all my stormy fate
A joy, a strength, a glory and a star.
Beneath the pines, where lonely camp-fires gleam,
In seas forlorn, amid the deserts drear,
How I had gladdened to that face of dream!
And never, never had it seemed so dear.
O silken hair that veils the sunny brow!
O eyes of grey, so tender and so true!
O lips of smiling sweetness! must I now
For ever and for ever go from you?
Ah, yes, I must... for if I do this thing,
How can I look into your face again?
Knowing you think me more than half a king,
I with my craven heart, my honour slain.
No! no! my mind's made up. I gaze above,
Into that sky insensate as a stone;
Not for my creed, my country, but my Love
Will I stand up and meet my death alone.
Then though it be to utter dark I sink,
The God that dwells in me is not denied;
'Best' triumphs over 'Beast', -  and so I think
Humanity itself is glorified....
'And now, my butchers, I embrace my fate.
Come! let my heart's blood slake the thirsty sod.
Curst be the life you offer! Glut your hate!
Strike! Strike, you dogs! I'll not deny my God.'
I saw the spears that seemed a-leap to slay,
All quiver earthward at the headman's nod;
And in a daze of dream I heard him say:
'Go, set him free who serves so well his God! '"
1689,Emotion,SoldierPoemsTheSongOfTheSoldierBornPoembyRobertWilliamService,"Give me the scorn of the stars and a peak defiant;
Wail of the pines and a wind with the shout of a giant;
Night and a trail unknown and a heart reliant.
Give me to live and love in the old, bold fashion;
A soldier's billet at night and a soldier's ration;
A heart that leaps to the fight with a soldier's passion.
For I hold as a simple faith there's no denying:
The trade of a soldier's the only trade worth plying;
The death of a soldier's the only death worth dying.
So let me go and leave your safety behind me;
Go to the spaces of hazard where nothing shall bind me;
Go till the word is War -  and then you will find me.
Then you will call me and claim me because you will need me;
Cheer me and gird me and into the battle-wrath speed me....
And when it's over, spurn me and no longer heed me.
For guile and a purse gold-greased are the arms you carry;
With deeds of paper you fight and with pens you parry;
You call on the hounds of the law your foes to harry.
You with your 'Art for its own sake', posing and prinking;
You with your 'Live and be merry', eating and drinking;
You with your 'Peace at all hazard', from bright blood shrinking.
Fools! I will tell you now: though the red rain patters,
And a million of men go down, it's little it matters....
There's the Flag upflung to the stars, though it streams in tatters.
There's a glory gold never can buy to yearn and to cry for;
There's a hope that's as old as the sky to suffer and sigh for;
There's a faith that out-dazzles the sun to martyr and die for.
Ah no! it's my dream that War will never be ended;
That men will perish like men, and valour be splendid;
That the Flag by the sword will be served, and honour defended.
That the tale of my fights will never be ancient story;
That though my eye may be dim and my beard be hoary,
I'll die as a soldier dies on the Field of Glory.
So give me a strong right arm for a wrong's swift righting;
Stave of a song on my lips as my sword is smiting;
Death in my boots may-be, but fighting, fighting."
1690,Emotion,SoldierPoemsTheBrokenSoldierPoembyKatharineTynan,"The broken soldier sings and whistles day to dark;
He's but the remnant of a man, maimed and half-blind,
But the soul they could not harm goes singing like the lark,
Like the incarnate Joy that will not be confined.
The Lady at the Hall has given him a light task,
He works in the gardens as busy as a bee;
One hand is but a stump and his face a pitted mask;
The gay soul goes singing like a bird set free.
Whistling and singing like a linnet on wings;
The others stop to listen, leaning on the spade,
Whole men and comely, they fret at little things.
The soul of him's singing like a thrush in a glade.
Hither and thither, hopping, like Robin on the grass,
The soul in the broken man is beautiful and brave;
And while he weeds the pansies and the bright hours pass
The bird caught in the cage whistles its joyous stave."

all of these emotions I’ve bottled up
bottled up tight for all these years

loose inside of me
eating away at me
slicing at my insides
trying to break free

or will they spread

infesting me

How can I fix this
How can I release this

Nor victory, nor defeat--no more time's dark events,
Charging like ceaseless clouds across the sky.
But sing poet in our name,

Sing--as they close the doors of earth upon him--one verse,
For the heavy hearts of soldiers."

from your gorgeous throat,
agony and exaltation flow in one divide

your thighs are a loveword your hair
night's glittering lining of secret disport:
I aimed for the innermost moon
and rent, moved by the syntax and the slow
of sadness and of joy, so
I love you, love you so

I lament,
Who looks out for the students in this wreck?
Most teachers who speak out against sports,
Know it wouldn't be prudent,
It wouldn't be right,
Sports are society,
Sports are their right?
However, can we not collectively ask,
'Is it strange to pass school,
And then flunk out of life as a general rule? '
Stop to Think,
What should we prepare the students for,
How about those old test scores!
However, how long can we still fail to uplift their minds,
Before we show them the door?"
1698,Emotion,TodayPoemsForeverIsTodayPoembySandraFowler,"An Easter flower cuts light into the sill
The sound of suffering is forever still.
Tears of forgiveness warm the evening chill.
I hear His whisper in a rustling leaf,
'I would have been so lonely in my grief,
Without your fragile friendship, my good thief.
You did not scorn the pity of My frame,
But saw the Jesus in Me just the same,
I call you Friend, you need no other name.
My Father's house is just a breath away.
See. one by one the windows light our way.
I think He was expecting us today.'
Beyond the drama of earth's dying skies,
Joy is too powerful for human eyes.
Forever is today in Paradise.
For my dear friend, Ralph Russell who often requested this poem to be read at Easter."
1699,Emotion,TodayPoemsAYearAgoTodayPoembySarahLJohnsen,"We saw you last a year ago today.
A harsh November wind blew wild and cold;
The city lights below were on display
And all your words and smiles were spun with gold.
Posted: Maintenance, the tram would not run.
Plenty of time we said, another day.
Balanced on the rocks, saw the setting sun
Skipped along the path and laughed, another day.
We remember the fragrance of your hair
Your kiss, and the soft warmth of your embrace.
Your kind and gentle humor, always fair;
Our last day, honored by your grace.
The earth has traveled once around the sun
And all your plans and smiles have gone away.
Our years of regret have just begun
As we live without you still, another day.
Proud Soldiers must go where they are called
And the best  are called to special gates.
We face the loss of Good and are appalled
When time is cut by whimsy of the Fates.

1700,Emotion,TodayPoemsISawAButterflyTodayPoembyVenosTricon,"I saw a butterfly today
Small and green with no wings
Crawlsing into shadows\hiding from a world who ignores it's subtle beauty
Afraid to never be noticed...appreciated
I saw a butterfly today
Camoflauged and shielded in self-made walls
Neglecting the world of it's gentle touch
Afraid to be met with a forceful hand
I saw a butterfly today
Wings new and fresh
Excited with exhileration
Facing a world with new courage
Knowing it can not be harmed
I saw a butterfly today
Blue and gold streaked the sky
embracing the sunlight's rays
Fluttering around my head
Carring my heart on her flight
I saw a butterfly today"
1701,Emotion,TodayPoemsTodayIsTheDayOfFindingPoembyLindaHepner,"Today is the day for finding things again.
Tom Tiddler gives out pennies in his grove
And Ali Baba comes out from his den;
The world’s becoming one wide treasure trove!
There is no end until the last Amen.
Vienna’s woods hide many secrets, and
In paintings Henry Koerner gave us clues,
The quarries overgrown with trees and sand,
His parents walking side by side, the views
Of two receding figures hand in hand.
They’ll not return, but paintings that he took
Us to admire, the glorious, goldlit Klimt,
Hanging for all upon its brazen hook
With every dazzling curve and angle crimped,
Returns so the unquiet slain can close their book.
And three years after burial is found
The salt cup I desired all my life:
Cellini’s golden sculpture double crowned…
The gods of sea and earth, of man and wife,
Their feet entwined one to the other bound.
A Rembrandt surfaced with a telling tale
Of greed, her collar changed from cloth to fur;
With time the truth will out, and will not fail
To prick our conscience though we may prefer
To say we’re owners of some Holy Grail.
A Michelangelo, a Rubens in the fray,
A Donatello, under layered paint,
All are discovered on this Finding Day
As if God’s face turned back, without restraint
Smiling and handing us his great bouquet
Of blossoms blooming on our sleeping street
Singing a song renewing an old prayer:
Arise my love!  Let fly your earthbound feet,
Be like the petals on the flowering pear
And sing Amen!  The cycle is complete!
LRH

Today a series of extraordinary finds were reported in different news reports and the flowering pear trees blossomed all along our street"
1702,Emotion,TodayPoemsTodayPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"Today
My alarm clock failed to ring
Today
Yoo-Hoo, The clock did not sing
Today
The trains made me get to work late
I was left staring at their shut gates
Today
I found myself exceedingly alone
Shivering in the flat cold to the bone
Today
My lover called and I got ditched
I really thought we’re going to get hitched
Today
I stank dreadfully; I did not have a shower
The sad news drained me of my will power
Today
I counted my pennies in twos and fours
My pockets were empty and poor
All the food I ate was bitter and sour
Today
All the programmes on TV were boring
Repetitious episodes had been reoccurring
I couldn’t go out as the rain was pouring
Today
In-between my thighs, I kept feeling horny
That tingly-tingly feel was not at all funny
Today
I read the newspaper without focus
Wondering what was the entire fuss
About sleeping with one’s boss
A whole page dedicated to it, was the loss
Today
I listened to some sad love songs
Speculating where I had done wrong
Next time, yes! I am going to be strong
Today
I fantasised about my next affair
Detailing it in my head with care
Another tragedy I simply cannot bear
Today
I sang, spoke and smiled
Whilst I had my nails filed
Today
I made positive future plans
I am my own number one fan
Of many visions, I am the woman!
Also by definition, I am the woman!
Today
I passed life’s challenge
Having my hearty revenge
I went off to bed felicitous
Every today is always joyous!

1703,Emotion,TodayPoemsTodayWeAreWritingTodayYouReadPoembyKumarmaniMahakul,"We are writing today many verses
By command and grace of God,
By virtue and perseverance!
We are writing for God's service,
By his guidance in inner core,
For bringing transformation,
For cracking war and bringing peace,
We are writing today to transfer
The message of God in many poems,
You will read today and tomorrow!
Today we are writing, today you read,
Also tomorrow you read, read, and read,
For learning values and perspectives,
For developing inner beauty and personality,
When you uplift inner values and conscience
Automatically humanity shines with light,
You can decide what is right and wrong,
Expressing your selfless service towards all,
Carrying the values of divine empowerment,
Through love, peace and forgiveness you lead,
Godly knowledge helps you to recognize life.
Illusion cannot affect you if you are awakened,
Matters cannot bind you if you are detached,
Living life in attachment-free state you learn,
Every verse which carries God's message you read,
Name, fame, achievements, wealth and relationships,
All these things in material world are perishable,
At right time you acquire divine knowledge,
All those material things are related to body,
But you are soul different than body,
Finally when time of change comes,
You leave your body and form is changed,
Every material possession you leave behind
And it is destroyed in core of time!
Dear soul, you remain in awakened state.

1704,Emotion,TodayPoemsTodayPoembySiegfriedSassoon,"This is To-day, a child in white and blue
Running to meet me out of Night who stilled
The ghost of Yester-eve; this is fair Morn
The mother of To-morrow. And these clouds
That chase the sunshine over gleaming hills
Are thoughts, delighting in the golden change
And the ceremony of their drifting state.
This is To-day. To-morrow might bring death,—
And Life, the gleeful madrigal of birds,
Be drowned in glimmer of sleep. To-day I know
How sweet it is to spend these eyes, and boast
This bubble of vistaed memory and sense
Blown by my joy aloft the glittering airs
Of heavenly peace. Oh take me to yourselves,
Earth, sky, and spirit! Let me stand within
The circle of your transience, that my voice
May thrill the lonely silences with song."
1705,Emotion,TodayPoemsSonnetTheWorldToday11PoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"My mind is sick to see the state of things,
That happen here in clumsy manner still!
The selfish acts of men in my ear rings;
Society has become really ill.
There is no justice, fairness anywhere;
All crooks and pimps, drug lords alone will thrive;
Within the home and outside, foul is the air;
Most men, women from sins, most joy derive.
Money, the root of evils has powers;
A state of utter hopelessness prevails;
All seem to want unnatural, false flowers;
And people write not letters send/send e-mails!
It is a show of pomp and vanity!
All forget the road to Eternity."

I Came to buy a smile—today—
But just a single smile—
The smallest one upon your face
Will suit me just as well—
The one that no one else would miss
It shone so very small—
I'm pleading at the ""counter""—sir—
Could you afford to sell—
I've Diamonds—on my fingers—
You know what Diamonds are?
I've Rubies—live the Evening Blood—
And Topaz—like the star!

Many years after.

The sun's brightly shinning,
Birds are gaily singing,
Negativity today, is not winning.
I'n not drowning in the tide,
i'm swiming with it -
like a fish,
yet, althought painful past's not dead,
No longer do i hear,
their criticising voices in my head.
Can't forget the past -
But i can forgive,
banish their wrongs,
They're locked in the dark,
everyday's a good day is how i will live,
and mending my scared heart
Is a great place to start.

1709,Emotion,TodayPoemsTwoYearsAgoTodayPoembyAldoKraas,"Two years ago today it was the last time we saw each other
From that day on I never left you side
I looked into your eyes and said it repeatedly I love you
Two years ago today we spent our last Christmas together
So many things that you wanted to do, but you couldn’t do it anymore Because of your condition
We had our last Christmas meal together
This time never seems to fade away from my mind; I still remember it Until today
Two years ago today you died at 1: 55 PM
This was the last hello and the last good bye we said to each other
I had done all the crying I needed
Slowly my pains are getting away
My anger is all gone now
It is easier now to talk about you
To tell you the truth, it doesn’t seem like two years"
1710,Emotion,TodayPoemsSonnetTheWorldToday3PoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"The world around look so topsy-turvy!
Nothing is permanent or ultimate;
Gone are the days of dropsy and scurvy;
Now people think they can all levitate.
And politics invades all other fields;
Most nations are riddled by corruption;
Black-money, clout and ‘goondas’ power wields;
Nothing happens by mere assumption.
Red-tapism has people on their knees;
Professionals have been much humbled oft;
Both individuals and nations have no peace;
To acts of injustice, God appears soft!
O God, when will an order new set in?
When will all earthlings shun away from sin?"
1711,Emotion,TodayPoemsOurWorldTodayPoembyZsaKiaraDBoggs,"Open your eyes and you will see,
Just how beautiful our earth can be.
No animal would ever be rare,
If everyone would try to care.
Trees would not be lying dead,
And all of earth's animals would be fed.
All of the bears would have plenty of honey,
And there would even be carrots for every bunny.
If everyone picked up one piece of trash,
Our litter problem would be gone in a flash.
Tomorrow take a good look at the sky's new dawn,
And realize someday all of this might be gone.
Remember the important part that you play,
In saving our planet for a future day.
Our childrens' eyes with your help will see,
Just how beautiful our earth can be."

It will be a sad day, oh but then again

What will I say?
Will I cry?
Of all the places you could have died
Why in my heart deep inside
It has been a very painful rollercoaster ride
Ive tried more than once to bury you
I kept hanging on trying to convince myself
that you might love me to
Enough is enough so
Today is the day I bury you"
1713,Emotion,TodayPoemsTodayIWillGoOnceAgainPoembyVelimirKhlebnikov,"Today I will go once again
Into life, into haggling, into market,

1714,Emotion,TodayPoemsBeingTodayPoembyMichaelShepherd,"Today is that day
not on  the calendar,
as National Olfactory Day,
but far more exciting than that:
the day when scent, fragrance, smell,
awoke on the warm sunlit air from a winter's sleep
and out of nowhere easily spoken of
produced a whole new world.
The first shock was the hedge two doors down
which yesterday was a green hedge with white bits
but today a burst of fragrance, a Hallelujah Chorus
transcribed to be played with or on or in the nose.
The restaurant two blocks up
unleashed from its kitchen
garlic that burst out like a bunch of singing nudists into the street
cavorting shamelessly and shouting to the world
every Mediterranean memory
of romantic meals and much else
that one thought private.
Then subtle smells that made one into a cat or dog
pursuing trails not on the street map
and making beaten tracks into voyages of discovery:
the baker's became a European trip of fresh morning bread
with another hundred freeze-dried memories unloosed;
And all down the street,
other people's lunches opened their front doors
and said 'Come and join us! We're having roast beef today
with all the trimmings, and we've enough smell
to feed the five thousand! '
and a hundred gardens one thought dormant
leaned on the front gate
and exchanged the time of year with a childlike innocence
that couldn't be told to come inside this minute or else,
and presented nosegays to strangers
without asking for a contribution to a cause.
A day for bringing past happinesses out from the store cupboard
and giving them a shake and leaving them on the line
until the sunlight moves off
and the air leaves them cooler and even fresher;
and wondering whom one will be tomorrow,
if one can feel like this today."
1715,Emotion,TodayPoemsFebruary21WhoseBirthdayTodayPoembyMichaelShepherd,"If you saw the film 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'
you'd have been moved maybe to tears
by his 'Funeral Blues';
If you were a college poetry student
the day after 9/11
you might have had your poet in residence
read his 'September 1,1939'
and had your breath taken away
by its accidental appropriateness
and the last line, which he wanted to amend,
'We must love each other, or die'
Two poems he himself didn't think quite good enough..
this is posthumous fame beyond the control
of poets;
this is what poetry can leave to the world;
this is what poetry is.
Wystan Hugh Auden would have been 100 today.
Rest In Poetry."
1716,Emotion,TodayPoemsIThoughtItWouldRainTodayPoembyHughCobb,"I thought it would rain today
sky hanging low & threatening
but like a bully w/o balls
it merely blustered:
making idle threats
sky crying, 'Wolf! '
an empty politician's promise...
I was hoping for cold & wet
something wintry & seasonal at least
but had to settle for a monotonous grey
that covers Winter's sky a cold blanket
rarely broken by clear, piercing blue
Light so clean it hurts
to see naked trees
Naked truth...
What are we to do
when seasons run together a blur
so you have to check a calender
just to know what the season is...
weather as metaphor for mediocrity.
Tabloidized information corrupted
& fed by special interests
(the mysterious 'they')
when it is we who have abdicated,
given our power to the box
surrendered to pushers of mediocrity & fear
who deliver their products
on the evening news
brought to you by the latest disease...
Even weathermen try:
making any gust of wind
a matter of life & death:
disaster specials, tabloid storified
glorified fear:
'Watch tornadoes from the safety
of your very own boudoir! ! ! '
& all so we don't really have to feel
anything
thats remotely honest or real...
Where is Noah, now?
Who's building an ark?
Because if that sameness,
blandness & false sense of security
is ever replaced w/ winter's piercing light
we can go inside & reflect
on who we really are
on who we want to be...
So when fear mongers &
pushers of mediocrity call,
the promise of rain, of flooding
& destruction will not be
just an idle threat.

Just for today I will greet someone I don't particularly like - and mean it
Just for today I will sing a song and not care if I am off key or who hears
Just for today I will do something I want to do, no matter what anyone else thinks
Just for today I will give someone a word of affirmation - not because I have to, but because I want to
Just for today I will be grateful for who I have in my life, not what I have
Just for today I will say a sincere thank you if I receive a compliment and not joke it away
Just for today I will do each task to the best of my ability
Just for today I will hug someone

Just for today I will appreciate having a job, a bed and food

1720,Emotion,TodayPoemsAReasonToSmileTodayPoembyAngelaRMFerrer,"I saw a reason to smile today
when I saw a butterfly flutter its wings around my way.
I saw a reason to smile today,
when I heard the children laughing and playing
under the warm sun of May.
I saw a reason to smile today,

But most of all,
I saw a reason to smile today,
when I saw you pass by, which completed my day."
1721,Emotion,TodayPoemsWhatAWildWindTodayPoembyMichaelShepherd,"What a wild wind today
in Wimbledon Park,
80 mph they say,
mischievous, shameless,
wild child, it cannot distinguish
between fun and destruction
here in the park
it does what it can with the boating lake;
but the ripples are barely waves,
and the boat club has wisely shored its boats,
no fun to be had there
but wait – here’s a woman with a covered pram
walking along the path beside the lake…
the crafty wind dies down, then
one huge gust – whew, that was a near one,
she’ll remember that next time..
now it’s spotted three laughing nuns – what fun!
it tries to lift their skirts – it knows no shame
in its innocent fun; it would most like
to turn them into whirling, spinning dervishes in black;
instead, it catches their veils, as they, laughing
as if they are being teased by their own sweet Lord,
as Krishna (would they know)  by milkmaids -
turn this way and that to avoid it;
they look like startled magpies, now like
laundry on the convent clothes-line;
it would love to make them into
divine helicopters
now it’s looking round the sports field;
the cricket ball’s too heavy, no fun there;
it does its best to be twelfth man
in a soccer game, but lacks the patience
to do more than bend it to the goal; it hasn't learnt
to pass, dribble, stepover, show off..
but now it spots the tennis courts and
uses all its thwarted bowler’s skill
to turn the service and return
to swing this way and that;
the teenage boy, eyes sparkling,
joins it in the fun, a double act,
wins point after point in this windy game;
a few scarved spectators cheer on his skill.
the wind is nature’s free testing kit;
it tries every tall tree in the park
to test their roots; and they perhaps
sending a fast intelligence from branch to root,
become a little stronger if they do not fall..
now it’s moving on to test the works of man –
no need to pay consultants’ fees
to check your roof tiles; the wind will do this
more thoroughly and for free..
and now it’s spotted laundry on the line
in the back garden – here’s its chance
to play at being a human being!
it loves most of all, men’s shirts –
fills their arms like sumo wrestlers,
hunches overblown backs
like a row of fat men bending over food
and now the sun comes out –
the wind is suddenly subdued
as if its master had just entered the cosmic room;
and I’m suddenly full of joy, as if
I had never known until now
that they might love each other, sun and wind,
for some reason which includes us all"
1722,Emotion,TodayPoemsTodayIStartedLovingYouAgainPoembyDavidHarris,"There was a time when
I thought that our love was failing.
Then you got ill and nearly died,
and I found out how a lonely life would be,
so today I started loving you again.
The sun in my life began to shine again,
the roses in our garden even started to bloom,
my life began to lift me higher,
and our home is a battleground no more,
for today, I started loving you again.
Never will I doubt our love again.
We have something so precious;
I would be a fool to let it go.
I now realise the consequences.
So today, I started loving you again.

the first day of the rest of you life

People are cheats and cheat themselves all life;

Yesterday spelled her name
Today or when-torn
Screaming at the flame
Of the one year candle
Missed you, dreamed you
Lost you, can't handle

Twist of fate lifted the ground
Changes-music is loud

1727,Emotion,TodayPoemstheRecruiterCalledTodayPoembyMaryNagy,"The recruiter called today
for my oldest child.
I politely told him
''She's not interested.''
He promised she would have
college paid for,
a very slim chance of being sent to war,
and the pride of being a soldier.
I informed him of her interest
in criminal justice.
I let him know she is going to college
and we will figure out how to finance it.
He sang me the praises of the
Military Police.
Told me of how proud she would be
and how proud I should be if she chose this path.
He explained how if she was working on a degree
she could not be sent into active duty on dangerous lands.
But, in his next breath he told me how she would get her degree
in a much faster pace than in a traditional college setting.
I declined interest
while I pretended to write the number he left for my daughter.
I did tell her about his phone call
but I also told her why I hope she doesn't choose
to be a soldier.
Is my greediness with my childs life a sin?
I know ''somebody has to do it''...
but, I can't bare the thought
of my child being sent to fight in a war.
I realize this is probably very
un-patriotic.
For that, I'm sorry.
I have lost many things in my lifetime.
My childs life is not one of those things I wish to sacrifice
for the good of my country.
I love my country
but, I love my children more.
**I respect all the soldiers who are willing to fight for their countries.  My Grandfather, Father, and Husband have all fought in wars.  I am very proud of them all.  I am not disrespecting soldiers.  I'm just sharing my feelings....I'm not at all claiming they are the ''right'' way to feel.  Sincerely, Mary"
1728,Emotion,TodayPoemsSonnetTheWorldToday15PoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"Lo, when I see a new obituary,
Untimed demise of one of great repute;
Or a sad man's Auto-biography,
A family- feud due to a land dispute.
And when I hear news of a robbery,
A cold-blooded murder in broad daylight;
An act of rape or of adultery;
of two Brothers who had a silly fight!
The kidnap-story of a doctor's child,
A necklace snatched at point of knife in light;
The rampage of animals from the wild,
I curse this world with all my lingual might.
'Tis sad how men have turned a world so nice
Into a den of fear and grief and vice."

1730,Emotion,TodayPoemsYesterdayAndTodayXiiPoembyKhalilGibran,"The gold-hoarder walked in his palace park and with him walked his troubles. And over his head hovered worries as a vulture hovers over a carcass, until he reached a beautiful lake surrounded by magnificent marble statuary.
He sat there pondering the water which poured from the mouths of the statues like thoughts flowing freely from a lover's imagination, and contemplating heavily his palace which stood upon a knoll like a birth-mark upon the cheek of a maiden. His fancy revealed to him the pages of his life's drama which he read with falling tears that veiled his eyes and prevented him from viewing man's feeble additions to Nature.
He looked back with piercing regret to the images of his early life, woven into pattern by the gods, until he could no longer control his anguish. He said aloud, ""Yesterday I was grazing my sheep in the green valley, enjoying my existence, sounding my flute, and holding my head high. Today I am a prisoner of greed. Gold leads into gold, then into restlessness and finally into crushing misery.
""Yesterday I was like a singing bird, soaring freely here and there in the fields. Today I am a slave to fickle wealth, society's rules, and city's customs, and purchased friends, pleasing the people by conforming to the strange and narrow laws of man. I was born to be free and enjoy the bounty of life, but I find myself like a beast of burden so heavily laden with gold that his back is breaking.
""Where are the spacious plains, the singing brooks, the pure breeze, the closeness of Nature? Where is my deity? I have lost all! Naught remains save loneliness that saddens me, gold that ridicules me, slaves who curse to my back, and a palace that I have erected as a tomb for my happiness, and in whose greatness I have lost my heart.
""Yesterday I roamed the prairies and the hills together with the Bedouin's daughter; Virtue was our companion, Love our delight, and the moon our guardian. Today I am among women with shallow beauty who sell themselves for gold and diamonds.
""Yesterday I was carefree, sharing with the shepherds all the joy of life; eating, playing, working, singing, and dancing together to the music of the heart's truth. Today I find myself among the people like a frightened lamb among the wolves. As I walk in the roads, they gaze at me with hateful eyes and point at me with scorn and jealousy, and as I steal through the park I see frowning faces all about me.
""Yesterday I was rich in happiness and today I am poor in gold.
""Yesterday I was a happy shepherd looking upon his head as a merciful king looks with pleasure upon his contented subjects. Today I am a slave standing before my wealth, my wealth which robbed me of the beauty of life I once knew.
""Forgive me, my Judge! I did not know that riches would put my life in fragments and lead me into the dungeons of harshness and stupidity. What I thought was glory is naught but an eternal inferno.""
He gathered himself wearily and walked slowly toward the palace, sighing and repeating, ""Is this what people call wealth? Is this the god I am serving and worshipping? Is this what I seek of the earth? Why can I not trade it for one particle of contentment? Who would sell me one beautiful thought for a ton of gold? Who would give me one moment of love for a handful of gems? Who would grant me an eye that can see others' hearts, and take all my coffers in barter?""
As he reached the palace gates he turned and looked toward the city as Jeremiah gazed toward Jerusalem. He raised his arms in woeful lament and shouted, ""Oh people of the noisome city, who are living in darkness, hastening toward misery, preaching falsehood, and speaking with stupidity...until when shall you remain ignorant? Unit when shall you abide in the filth of life and continue to desert its gardens? Why wear you tattered robes of narrowness while the silk raiment of Nature's beauty is fashioned for you? The lamp of wisdom is dimming; it is time to furnish it with oil. The house of true fortune is being destroyed; it is time to rebuild it and guard it. The thieves of ignorance have stolen the treasure of your peace; it is time to retake it!""
At that moment a poor man stood before him and stretched forth his hand for alms. As he looked at the beggar, his lips parted, his eyes brightened with a softness, and his face radiated kindness. It was as if the yesterday he had lamented by the lake had come to greet him. He embraced the pauper with affection and filled his hands with gold, and with a voice sincere with the sweetness of love he said, ""Come back tomorrow and bring with you your fellow sufferers. All your possessions will be restored.""
He entered his palace saying, ""Everything in life is good; even gold, for it teaches a lesson. Money is like a stringed instrument; he who does not know how to use it properly will hear only discordant music. Money is like love; it kills slowly and painfully the one who withholds it, and it enlivens the other who turns it upon his fellow man."""

The kind of life we lead, can most depress;
The policies on health are in a mess;
One man attempts the other to suppress.
The one with lesser talents doth impress;
The modern gadgets make all labor less;
How do you curb population’s excess,
And people gain favors through their largess?
Where is today, the freedom of the press?
Each day, they introduce a newer cess!
Revealing body-parts is now the dress;
That Doomsday’s nigh is but anyone’s guess.

Today is the day I stop wondering how you are doing, if you are happy and how I can make you give that smile that makes my heart skip a beat

BANKERS TRUST AUTOMOBILE LOAN
You'll find a banker at Bankers Trust""
Advertisement in N.Y. Times
When comes my second childhood,
As to all men it must,
I want to be a banker
Like the banker at Bankers Trust.
I wouldn't ask to be president
Or even assistant veep,
I'd only ask for a kiddie car
And permission to go beep-beep.
The banker at Chase Manhattan,
He bids a polite Good-day;
The banker at Immigrant Savings
Cries Scusi! and Olé!
But I'd be a sleek Ferrari
Or perhaps a joggly jeep,
And scooting around at Bankers Trust,
Beep-beep, I'd go, beep-beep.
The trolley car used to say clang-clang
And the choo-choo said toot-toot,
But the beep of the banker at Bankers Trust
Is every bit as cute.
Miaow, says the cuddly kitten,
Baa, says the woolly sheep,
Oink, says the piggy-wiggy,
And the banker says beep-beep.
So I want to play at Bankers Trust
Like a hippety-hoppety bunny,
And best of all, oh best of all,
With really truly money.
Now grown-ups dear, it's nightie-night
Until my dream comes true,
And I bid you a happy boop-a-doop
And a big beep-beep adieu."

Men live without peace, love and harmony;
The root cause of all evils is money;
Human life has lost its bare dignity.
Human labor has become very cheap;
Forgotten is the brotherhood of nations;
Humanity survives on small rations;
Prices of commodities are all steep.
Richer nations accrue wealth, keeping fine;
Scarcity of things is wholly manmade;
Most people live below poverty-line;
Poor nations survive just on World Bank’s aid!
Who will to reset the world into order?
When every man truly loves his neighbor!"

1742,Emotion,TodayPoemsTodayISawAHedgehogPoembyGrahamJones,"Today I saw a Hedgehog
A funny looking thing
He crept across the lawn outside
As I sat watching him
He snuffled through the leaves and grass
His nose twitched like a snake
And then he stopped quite suddenly
As he came across a rake
At first he rolled into a ball
Quite comical to see
Then slowly poked his head out
And I'm sure he winked at me
Once more he turned towards the rake
Who's spines looked somewhat higher
And slowly moved toward it
With what to me, looked like desire
First he nudged it with his nose
Then rubbed against the prongs
Then getting no reaction
Seemed to sense that somethings wrong
And then he tried to mount it
But that just came to grief
And shuffled off indignantly
Which came as some relief
And so I've learned a moral
From this hedgehog in his teens
Things that we take for granted
Are not always as they seem."

The potential in each other
To be friends and not lovers"

I’ve learned my lesson

And hurt within
But everyday I make one mistake
I wish I could take it away
And all the pain my friends have felt
I wish it would go away

And rather burn than cry
But everyday I make
More and more mistakes
I don’t know if I can go on"

Of highs and lows
When the winds blow and the waters flow
Today is just another day
A day to make amends and new friends
For there will come a time it will all end
Today is just another day
We eat and go to work
Some seat and wait for luck
Others cheat giving the sweet talk
Today is just another day
Where we must live for tomorrow
Or give in to everlasting sorrow
Today is just another day
We breathe in the same air
Trying to invent new ideas
Exhibiting passionate care or fear
Today is just another day
While some of us delight in joy
Others will find a way to deploy
Tools to destroy the moments we enjoy
Today is no different from yesterday
Technology the only change in the game
The people are still the same
Looking for one to take on the blame
Always worshipping those with a name
Broken hearts and love keep alive the dying flame
Today is just another day
It will fade away
Quickly into yesterday
Tomorrow then gladly will become today!"
1750,Emotion,TodayPoemsTodayILitACandlePoembyLindaHarnett,"Today I lit a candle,
In memory of you,
A very special tribute,
A flame of gold and blue.
The flame it burned so brightly,
I sat and watched it glow,
It took me back to yesteryears,
A long, long time ago.
I thought about how things have been,
For me, since you’ve been gone,
Were your hopes, for me fulfilled,
Have I turned out, proud and strong.
Did I stand, by what you taught,
Did I let you down sometimes,
Did I always listen to,
Advice you left behind.
I’ve tried to so hard throughout the years,
To live it by the letter,
Did I make you proud of me,
Or could I have done better.
And looking back, I’m sure that you,
Would love me just the same,
You know my faults, you realise,
I’m only human too.
Today I lit a candle,
With gratitude and love,
And you were there to catch the flame,
Of true eternal love."

behind deceiving eyes
Those men who once wore hoods and robes
Today wear shirts and ties
Their methods changed but yet and still,
Their mission is the same
Today they lynch with politics,
the racist's favorite game
Divide and conquer is their plan
to keep minorities
From seeing that the forest lies
just shortly past the trees
Racism lurks within the press,
courthouses, banks and schools
Black folks convinced that all is well
have certainly been fooled
A racist underground exists,
a chilling fact indeed
They seek to kill, steal and destroy,
We can't let them succeed"

I was completely caught off guard
when the sudden flood of memories
were found inside a card.
The card was sent to you.
It had an air of 'young and sweet'.
You were still in my belly
and I feared we'd never meet.
The doctors warned of danger
so I prayed like none before.
I prayed you would be healthy
for me to just adore.
They put me up on bedrest
and said to ''Just stay put! ''
I couldn't leave the bedroom...
not even just a foot.
The months dragged by so slowly
but it was worth the wait.
They worried you wouldn't weigh 5 lbs
but you weighed nearly 8!
My one and only son.
No more babies for me.
I read the card I found today
and cried so joyously.
My visit to the attic
has renewed my faith in Him.
I felt my heart still glowing
as the attic lights went dim."
1754,Emotion,TodayPoemsKissMeTodayPoembyUriahHamilton,"Life is confusing
When your heart is sad;
It is difficult to distinguish
Who your true friends are
And who are merely interlopers
Meddling to step in,
Maneuvering for positions of advantage.
I’d like to go back to a simpler time,
Fill my mind with poetry,
Gaze out into the sunlight
From an afternoon window,
Ride a horse and carriage with you
Until the world was true.
But I’ve been exiled in a cruel country,
Cutting my teeth on the sour fruit
Of dissipating dreams and vanished youth,
My unshaven face has a humble grace
But I do not think you will kiss me today."
1755,Emotion,TodayPoemsSonnetOnCorruptionTodayPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"God, thwart the moves of men with minds insane;
Their corruption has reached enormous heights;
And masking all their crimes, righteous they feign;
Ill-gotten wealth, giving them sleepless nights!
How long this land can bear their insults, Lord?
How longer must the poor suffer hard-ships?
The corrupt own most resources, O God;
Most transactions are carried out by ‘tips’!
The people have been cheated for ages;
The poor are made poorer by corrupt men;
The employees get paid paltry wages.
For honest folk, the earth is no haven!
Most lives are endangered by corruption;
The world does need a cleansing eruption!

When you are close to me then my worries disappear
and exchange of our love makes my heart strong
I didn't know the power of love until it showered from you
and you made me to understand what is love and be loved
Today, I am falling in love with you every single moment
Your heart leads me to your thoughts and senses
and tells me to tie my heart at night with yours
When morning comes then I wake up with your thoughts
and I recollect my dreams which I have buried with you
Brings me a smile on my face and rushing to hold you
and find my day is not enough to be with you in love
Hope you will understand that I cannot live with out you

By heart, on his own poor, old harmonium;
Though blind, he seems to be in God’s commune;
Alas! is this the new millennium?
Behold a lady working by hand-loom;

Victim of consumption that spread to womb;
That turns all hearts of sympathy so wild.
Behold the handicapped who jobs the lathe!
With fore-limbs lost by accident, the smiles;
’Tis hard and dangerous; his sweat does bathe;
In dignity he lives and walks home miles.
And lo, the whole some man in car complains,
And curses all while driving drunk through lanes!"
1758,Emotion,TodayPoemsIfJesusWasBornTodayPoembySteveTurner,"If Jesus was born today
it would be in a downtown motel
marked by a helicopter's flashing bulb.
A traffic warden, working late,
would be the first upon the scene.
Later, at the expense of a TV network,
an eminent sociologist,
the host of a chat show
and a controversial author
would arrive with their good wishes
-the whole occasion to be filmed as part of the
'Is This The Son Of God?' one hour special.
Childhood would be a blur of photographs and speculation
dwindling by his late teens into
'Where Is He Now?' features in Sunday magazines.
If Jesus was thirty today
they wouldn't really care about the public ministry,
they'd be too busy investigating His finances
and trying to prove He had Church or Mafia connections.
The miracles would be explained by
an eminent and controversial magician,
His claims to be God's Son recognised as
excellent examples of Spoken English
and immediately incorporated into
the O-Level syllabus,
His sinless perfection considered by moral philosophers
as, OK, but a bit repressive.
If Jesus was thirty-one today
He'd be the fly in everyone's ointment-
the sort of controversial person who
stands no chance of eminence.
Communists would expel Him, capitalists
would exploit Him or have Him
smeared by people who know a thing or two about God.
Doctors would accuse Him of quackery,
soldiers would accuse Him of cowardice,
theologians would take Him aside and try
to persuade Him of His non-existence.
If Jesus was thirty-two today we'd have to
end it all. Heretic, fundamentalist, literalist,
puritan, pacifist, non-conformist, we'd take Him
away and quietly end the argument.
But the argument would rumble in the ground
at the end of three days and would break out
and walk around as though death was some bug,
saying 'I am the resurrection and the life...
No man cometh to the Father but by me'.
While the magicians researched new explanations
and the semanticists wondered exactly what
He meant by 'I' and 'No man' there would be those
who stand around amused, asking for something
called proof."

I'm sorry for the Dead—Today—
It's such congenial times
Old Neighbors have at fences—
It's time o' year for Hay.
And Broad—Sunburned Acquaintance
Discourse between the Toil—
And laugh, a homely species
That makes the Fences smile—
It seems so straight to lie away
From all of the noise of Fields—
The Busy Carts—the fragrant Cocks—
The Mower's Metre—Steals—
A Trouble lest they're homesick—
Those Farmers—and their Wives—
Set separate from the Farming—
And all the Neighbors' lives—
A Wonder if the Sepulchre
Don't feel a lonesome way—
When Men—and Boys—and Carts—and June,
Go down the Fields to ""Hay""—"

1761,Emotion,TodayPoemsAustraliaToday1916PoembyBanjoPaterson,"They came from the lower levels
Deep down in the Brilliant mine;
From the wastes where the whirlwind revels,
Whirling the leaves of pine.
On the western plains, where the Darling flows,
And the dust storms wheel and shift,
The teamster loosened his yokes and bows,
And turned his team adrift.
On the western stations, far and wide,
There's many an empty pen,
For the ""ringers"" have cast the machines aside
And answered the call for men.
On the lucerne flats where the stream runs slow,
And the Hunter finds the sea,
The women are driving the mowers now,
With the children at their knee.
For the men have gone, as a man must go,
At the call of the rolling drums;
For the men have sworn that the Turks shall know
When the old battalion comes.
Column of companies by the right,
Steady in strong array,
With the sun on the bayonets gleaming bright,
The battalion marched away.
They battled, the old battalion,
Through the toil of the training camps,
Sweated and strove at lectures,
By the light of the stinking lamps.
Marching, shooting, and drilling;
Steady and slow and stern;
Awkward and strange, but willing
All of their job to learn.
Learning to use the rifle;
Learning to use the spade;
Deeming fatigue a trifle
During each long parade.
Till at last they welded
Into a concrete whole,
And there grew in the old battalion
A kind of battalion's soul.
Brotherhood never was like it;
Friendship is not the word;
But deep in that body of marching men
The soul of a nation stirred.
And like one man with a single thought
Cheery and confident;
Ready for all that the future brought,
The old battalion went.
Column of companies by the right,
Steady in strong array,
With the sun on the bayonets gleaming bright,
The battalion marched away.
How shall we tell of the landing
By the hills where the foe were spread,
And the track of the old battalion
Was marked by the Turkish dead?
With the dash that discipline teaches,
Though the hail of the shrapnel flew,
And the forts were raking the beaches,
And the toll of the dead men grew.
They fixed their grip on the gaunt hillside
With a pluck that has won them fame;
And the home-folks know that the dead men died
For the pride of Australia's name.
Column of companies by the right,
To the beat of the rolling drums;
With honours gained in a stirring fight
The old battalion comes!"

The busy parents pamper, pet and spoil;
The children never knowing truly why;
They fret and fume and burn the midnight-oil.
And children too are never satisfied;
Fast foods, bad lifestyles make them ill and weak;
In parental guidance, they don’t abide;
And help of God, they never seem to seek,
The modern child wishes to be on own;
And in the process, blunders so often;
To elderly advice, it seems to frown;
And lands in vices, amidst evil men.
If parents are not strict to rear a child,
It grows to be a flower in the wild.

brisk, businesslike  north wind,
I would make a great altar
and pile it high as heaven
with washing straight off the line
shirts like roly-poly hunchback
astronauts like human kites
a sharp flapping of hemmed edges
the squawk of hens surprised
laundry baskets full of the smell
of Spring and freshness  and new beginnings
laundry baskets that smell as if
a walk along the shores of love
all Your wind and air and water, and
sunlight soap, soapy sunlight making
iridescent bubbles in the washtub
the squeak of the mangle,
dripping into the sink
stained heavenly with Dolly Blue
the smell of love and motherhood
the hot iron’s steamy smell
the starch, the sharp warm ironed piles
ready for the cupboard shelves
and say, look everyone
this is a woman’s lifetime of unspoken love
see it made of the holy elements themselves
as on the first day of Creation
that is ever a woman’s life

Nations expanding nuclear arsenals!
Terrorists and drug-lords active always!
Bomb culture fast spreading its tentacles!
Global security has been threatened;
Poor nations are suppressed by the rich ones!
The abyss of world trade has been deepened;
They dig the earth to find the soil’s true sons!
Computers have turned one’s life fast-forward!
Robots do much more things, men used to do;
Human beings have become too wayward;
One nation plans the other’s Waterloo!
Money-power rules all facets of life!
With mind’s peace lost, man is in utter strife."

The Wind didn't come from the Orchard—today—
Further than that—
Nor stop to play with the Hay—
Nor joggle a Hat—
He's a transitive fellow—very—
Rely on that—
If He leave a Bur at the door
We know He has climbed a Fir—
But the Fir is Where—Declare—
Were you ever there?
If He brings Odors of Clovers—
And that is His business—not Ours—
Then He has been with the Mowers—
Whetting away the Hours
To sweet pauses of Hay—
His Way—of a June Day—
If He fling Sand, and Pebble—

1768,Emotion,TodayPoemsTodayThereIsNoEscapePoembyThomSchiele,"crashing thoughts against the additive glow
of evening..watching time sing between the foggy stars
a handsome dweller in the hours of hunting follows his own steps
Some Heaven knows the machine behind this smile
and collects the fallen teeth as they hit the grass and chew to hell
with out oil or esteem
picked apart by falling snow
torn down from the clouds like swords on judgment day
if such a day exists, it will be cold and withdrawn
like busted Televisions
yes that was us in the fire
Running from silence decided soon after the crash
Our train cars
burnt
and they lay down in the smoke mumbling metal alphabets
the sea decides for itself that the sun set with other ideas
and lulls against the shore ina timely addiction
My dearest darling scorched
and wide awake in the smoke
she was a child’s first smile after the first bee sting
she was the joints of my collapsed umbrella and the pines digging in my eyes
a book across my chest
my broken teeth and
where my soul escaped from photographs
She spoke in my last ear with her smoking tongue of the judgments to come
her body radiant with unkept poems
A fathers eyes
danced in the shining of scotch rye
as I stared into anything but the crushed countryside
we belted along
breathing to beat his undrunk thoughts
to the river
and find ourselves saved
from a fathers eyes
from the gun tucked between his legs
I stood tilted on the banks
and watched the soapy river surround my feet
I finally felt something
I turned around to a sober man long gone
I looked up to his gun
and then
up to his Heaven
and that’s the last time
I saw
a fathers eyes
Now they have come
to take her shell and cool my hotfoot
to hunt
today there is no escape
I am nothing more then an unkept poem
drowned in police scenes and silence"
1769,Emotion,TodayPoemsSonnetMyWorldTodayPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"The world I live in is not good at all;
I rarely find a human being good;
There isn’t a righteous one whom I can call;
The majority lives in evil-hood.
There is no one whom I can depend on;
The place abounds in ‘snakes and jackals’ much;
They move so stealthily by dusk and dawn;
For time being, they have a ‘Midas-touch’!
But things will change for good I do believe;
The evil ones will reap their punishment;
The world and God, one cannot long deceive;
God will usher the day of His Judgment!
And must I lead a file of men with masks?
My precious time is meant for better tasks!

For the first time they took me out into the sun today.
And for the first time in my life I was aghast
that the sky is so far away
and so blue
and so vast
I stood there without a motion.
Then I sat on the ground with respectful devotion
leaning against the white wall.
Who cares about the waves with which I yearn to roll
Or about strife or freedom or my wife right now.
The soil, the sun and me...
I feel joyful and how.

i stood in line and while i waited
i made a plan on how i would do it
oh, there would be a thrilling chase!
i imagined my friends cheering for me
as they watched the news from the
circling whirlybird camera
with police cruiser lightbars flashing madly
officers on the highway frantically throwing spikes
they would spot me on the tv screen
fleeting in my getaway car
like Clyde Barrow – a grand marshal
in some outrageous parade - with the
windows rolled down
as paper bills streamed from my ride
like confetti, parting the Red Sea
rush hour traffic in a race with Smokey
for the Mexican
frontera
...
the buxom brunette bank teller behind the plate glass
soon snapped me out of my deluded daydream
she was bored and unattentive
but i think she could tell i was up to no good.
i saw her later at the bar down the street, during
happy hour, chatting with some other young fella
smiling kindly and absently stirring her cocktail
i slugged a shot of rotgut tequila –
you know the kind, made with cactus in some
border-rushing tonk’s toilet –
walked up to the teller, whipped her around
on her seat, pulled her face into mine
and smeared her lipstick real good then
ambled on out into the street smiling broadly
i almost robbed a bank today
but planted a sweet one on the bank teller instead
something told me she needed some excitement, too"

My arms are sore, from hugging all night,

1782,Emotion,TodayPoemsIFeelLikeAProtestingMoodTodayPoembyDavidHarris,"I feel like a protesting mood today. Consecutive Governments all over the world are eroding our rights away one by one. We must not do this and we must not do that.
A good case in point is the smoking ban, well that has just got way out of hand. I agree no smoking in places where we eat, but now the idiots wants to ban you smoking in your own car! Now that is stretching it a bit too far. It makes you wonder what part of cloud cuckoo land their ideas come from.
Now I remember and it’s not that long ago, doctors encouraged you to smoke to calm your nerves. Now the same doctors are saying it is bad for you. However, it is all right for a group of them to plant a dirty bomb. Am I going mad or is there a double standard here? On the other hand, is it that they don’t have enough patients that they have to go out and create a few?
Then there are the Hospitals and doctors saying we will refuse to treat anyone that smokes. Hang on a minute, you will treat an alcoholic, which is self-infliction, a drug addict another self-infliction. Come on, a lot of you told us to smoke in the first place. Then the other day another doctor was saying that smoking actually help keep the airway clear. Am I missing something here?
Now I wonder what the Government would do if we all said there would be no drinking alcohol in any government building anywhere. Their Christmas parties would have to be held outside with Jack Frost. The point is if they couldn’t drink they might not fall asleep on the front bench, and we might get a few good laws that would do us all some good. Lets all vote in taking their rights away, just like they have been doing to ours. I’ve had enough of protesting to day. Thank you for listening, now I’m going away to write some pretty poetry.

1783,Emotion,TodayPoemsWithTearsTheyBuriedYouTodayPoembyLucyMaudMontgomery,"With tears they buried you to-day,
But well I knew no turf could hold
Your gladness long beneath the mould,
Or cramp your laughter in the clay;
I smiled while others wept for you
Because I knew.
And now you sit with me to-night
Here in our old, accustomed place;
Tender and mirthful is your face,
Your eyes with starry joy are bright­
Oh, you are merry as a song
For love is strong!
They think of you as lying there
Down in the churchyard grim and old;
They think of you as mute and cold,
A wan, white thing that once was fair,
With dim, sealed eyes that never may
Look on the day.
But love cannot be coffined so
In clod and darkness; it must rise
And seek its own in radiant guise,
With immortality aglow,
Making of death's triumphant sting
A little thing.
Ay, we shall laugh at those who deem
Our hearts are sundered! Listen, sweet,
The tripping of the wind's swift feet
Along the by-ways of our dream,
And hark the whisper of the rose
Wilding that blows.
Oh, still you love those simple things,
And still you love them more with me;
The grave has won no victory;
It could not clasp your shining wings,
It could not keep you from my side,
Dear and my bride!"

And provide them with all that they may need;
To shelter, clothe them- what a great number!
And showing them the way to good slumber!
New millennium has brought on a new hype!
Ignorance makes them smoke tho’ not a pipe;
Day by day scarce resources become scant;
But none prefer to work hard like an ant.
The country’s heritage is in peril;
The rush for Big-Money is the devil;
Most people ignore life’s sense of values;
Our country can’t afford to repay dues.
Rededication is the one answer;
Keeping this goal, let Indians endeavor.

I will tame me a caribou
And bedeck it with marabou.

I can play chopsticks on the Wurlitzer,
I can speak Portuguese like a Berlitzer.

1791,Emotion,PowerPoemsThePowerOfNothingPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"Inside a tree a squirrel sat,
he was well-nourished, even fat.
He spotted then the owl who, wise,
was sought out by the forest's guys
if information was the need.
And of all critters owls, indeed
do have a comprehensive brain
(it is the reason they are vain) .
The squirrel asked about the snow, '
the weight of flakes he aimed to know.
'Each snowflake' said the owl 'weighs naught,
that's what experience has taught.'
The squirrel, who would sit for hours
to sharpen observation powers:
'Howcould this be my learned friend,
snow must weigh something, in the end?
Last winter, as I watched it snow,
the ground came closer from below
and as I sat here in the tree
I was positioned thus to see
how more and more the snow would rise
to white and pretty looking highs.
Each branch received a goodly portion
and some would bend into distortion.
The weight of sixteen million flakes
is, from my view, just what it takes
to snap my perch like some thin twig,
so tell me wise owl, with a wig
what made it break if snow weighs nil!
Kindly explain this if you will.'
'yes, it can be' the owl proclaimed,
her words were with intention aimed
at all the critters.'Now and then
and once a year, and then again,
a bit of nothing will suffice
to crush a solid block of ice,
or fell a tree of strapping strength
and cut in half the height and length
of things that live with us each day.
It is a price they have to pay.'
'A bit of nothing thus can cause
the overturning of great laws,
of physics, chemistry and maths,
of Bunsen burners, acid baths.
There is no use to whine and fret,
it's what you get. It's what you get.'"

1793,Emotion,PowerPoemsSonnetPowerCorruptsPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"How change of chairs makes human beings queer!
That power corrupts minds is truly true;
No lion can ever become a deer;
Nor can any elephant like cows moo.
How men in power behave so different!
Power alone cannot command respect;
How men settle old scores with mind so bent!
The Power-Bug can any man infect.
And very soon misuse of power begins,
The man his doom in much unconceived of ways;
Unless level-headed, be they earthlings,
Prematurely, ill-fated end their days.
The humble man in power stays for long,
Desisting all his life from doing wrong."

Prayers are granted too
Bones and more bones
Would surely rain from

For me, and he reserves the rest.

Behold a new baby was born
Into a world of love
Together the moved mountains
Together they frooze fountains
to build bridges of support
Behold I was mesmerised by its power
To which I was no unfamiliar stranger
Together the vigorously fought
for peace and freedom
Together they sang the song of
Love, love, love
The amount of energy in one space
I could not possibly put a finger on to trace
But it held the ultimate power to light up my face
There is nothing more powerful than

1798,Emotion,PowerPoemsThePowerOfTheDogPoembyRudyardKipling,"There is sorrow enough in the natural way
From men and women to fill our day;
And when we are certain of sorrow in store,
Why do we always arrange for more?
Brothers and Sisters, I bid you beware
Of giving your heart to a dog to tear.
Buy a pup and your money will buy
Love unflinching that cannot lie--
Perfect passion and worship fed
By a kick in the ribs or a pat on the head.
Nevertheless it is hardly fair
To risk your heart for a dog to tear.
When the fourteen years which Nature permits
Are closing in asthma, or tumour, or fits,
And the vet's unspoken prescription runs
To lethal chambers or loaded guns,
Then you will find--it's your own affair--
But...you've given your heart for a dog to tear.
When the body that lived at your single will,
With its whimper of welcome, is stilled (how still!);
When the spirit that answered your every mood
Is gone--wherever it goes--for good,
You will discover how much you care,
And will give your heart for the dog to tear.
We've sorrow enough in the natural way,
When it comes to burying Christian clay.
Our loves are not given, but only lent,
At compound interest of cent per cent.
Though it is not always the case, I believe,
That the longer we've kept 'em, the more do we grieve:
For, when debts are payable, right or wrong,
A short-time loan is as bad as a long--
So why in Heaven (before we are there)
Should we give our hearts to a dog to tear?"
1799,Emotion,PowerPoems504GodsPowerPoembyMelvinaGermain,"the power of God is truly amazing, he never dissapoints us.  Even when we think he may have forgotten us, he shows his hand and the glory of his love.
I had many family issues in the last few weeks and just couldn't take it anymore so I did what I consider to be the obvious.  I gave all my troubles to God and left them in his hands, my daughter did the same.
I decided to write a prayer letting Satan know he doesn't scare me and at the end of that prayer when I dotted the last period, I heard someone at the door and there was my long lost son.
Earlier in the day, everyone said when they finally see my son again they would hit him, give him a piece of their mind.  All I could do when I laid eyes on him was hug him and let him know how much I loved him.
After giving my troubles over to the Lord, my daughter and I, everything seemed to immediatlely turn around.  I just want to thankyou Jesus.
In the name of your precious son 'Jesus'

1800,Emotion,PowerPoemsThereIsNothingWrongWithPowerPoembyFrancisDuggan,"'Tis sad to think that many with power abuse it those with power who abuse it weak not strong
There is nothing wrong with having power in the first place it is the abuse of it that is all wrong
For the abuse of power leads to serious crimes against the powerless though power in good hands it is quite okay
And good people with power never do abuse it they use it in the most constructive way
Some people with power are quite benign people and philanthropic one of them can say
But those who abuse their power to the law may never answer though to karma there's a price they have to pay
The abuse of power leads to dictatorial regimes that leads to serious crimes against humanity
In the despicable crimes against women and children the wrongs of power gone wrong for all to see
The people who abuse their power should never have it though to their power they desperately do cling
Power in the right hands an adavantage to others and power in the wrong hands is a dangerous thing
There is nothing wrong with power from once 'tis used well but some with power they do abuse their rule
And some with power they can become quite nasty and derive pleasure out of being cruel
But power in the right hands can be a blessing and kind people with power their praise we ought sing
Since they have the gift of empathy within them and happiness to others they do bring."

heartfelt passions spoken in a line.
What better place to find serenity
than in the prayer of a poet online.
Gathered in unity, divided in style;
souls searching for perfect peace
touching lives by a timely rhyme
giving solace and pain's release.
Seeking an emissary to heaven's throne?
To whisper entreaties to Angels there;
No better place to reach God's ear
than through the power of a poet's prayer."
1802,Emotion,PowerPoemsATowerOfPowerPoembyBenGieske,"We will build a tower
With unbridled spring-water attitudes
Flowing with fires of charity
For all the suffering multitudes
Dispossessed and swallowing poverty
We will give them power
We will build a tower
With lots of windows and no ears
With promises for those who have ceased their quest
For the young and old in years
For those who no longer turn west
We will give them power
We will give them power
Give them tomorrows and rainbows in tomorrow’s flowers
Help them fill pitchers with milk, honey, and cream
Reap the green of crops they have never seen
Shelter them from the cold, black screams
They will scale the tower
We will build a tower
They will scale like goats and soar like eagles
Who climbs higher than these birds?
They will peer through rose-colored gothic windows
And see the many rainbows of blooming flowers spilling colors
They will have the power
We will build a tower
For those near and far
Those who lost their dreams
Those who ceased the quest
Those no longer traveling west
Our actions will speak louder than words
They will sing the music of the birds
Learn to disregard the terms
Of all their unanswered yearns

1803,Emotion,PowerPoemsNuclearPowerPoembyIrenaKsepko,"How the time passes by.
We are unable to arrest it.
How quick the people are leaving this world.
We are unable to prolong our existence on this land.
We therefore should not take it away
As we are approaching to the end of the twentieth century.
Many nations of this world are racing to build their armaments.
Why are they doing it?
To destroy this land with the people living on it.
Can we be proud having an atom bomb.
Those who have it are announcing to the world their power.
Without thinking of a mistake and dimensions of destruction.
How funds are melting away to build them and be tested.
These funds can be used for the hungry masses,
To feel them and fertilize our land to make it richer.
A multitude of people would be satisfied
They would be happy and enormously grateful
Maybe that day will come.
That we will together save the nature and masses of people.
The bomb once thrown carries only death and destruction
Everything would be reduced to ashes.
All living things would die, even trees.
To the ones alive a bird would not sing
Because of the nuclear experiments people are becoming poorer
Lets give some thought how to conquer that evil.
Lets look differently on nature and perceive its beauty.
This world is indeed charming,
India is a mysterious and curious country.
Is the atom bomb for them a paradise?
Among the other countries it brought indignation,
Is it worth to change your own country into hate?
Atom bond will not solve problems and feed people
Why not anybody is thinking about it,
Lets use the atom for peaceful purposes
Lets leave the decisions to the highly developed countries,
How to save the land from being fed with poison,
How to fertilize, so that the masses will not be hungry,
Also war, but not nuclear,
Must be proclaimed to the element of nature.
Not necessarily atom weapons for destruction.
It is being done with perfectionism by cataclysm,
That is the real enemy of people.
We must learn hot to strive to subdue it,
Then we will not be the perpetrators
Of exterminating this beautiful globe,
As is our MOTHER EARTH."
1804,Emotion,PowerPoemsAhPowerPowerPoembyEmmanuelGeorgeCefai,"Ah power! Power

1805,Emotion,PowerPoemsDoYouHavePowerPoembyJuliusBabarinsa,"The word power is ambiguous and mystifying
Power is interrelated and measurable
The word power is vague and ambivalent
Everybody is believed to have some form of power
Nations and societies are said to have their own powers
The use of power depends on circumstances
Power can be used positively or negatively
The president as the commander-in-chief
Has power to declare war and federal emergency
The congress has power to enact laws
The bank has power to grant or deny you a
Loan to improve your status in life
The editor has power to decide what gets
Published in a book, dailies, or journals
Armed forces have power to defend the nation
Police have power to arrest and detain crooks
Medical doctors have power to heal the sick
Many of us have power to make a beggar smile
Voters have power to elect their representatives
For both the lower house and the senate
Employers have power to enrich and enhance
The lives and positions of their employees
Teachers have power to educate our mind
Husbands have power to please their wives
And keep their children happy and contented
As power cannot be used or exercised in isolation
We should realize that we are all citizens of this world
We owe it to our children to use our powers positively
To help make this world a better and friendly place
So that we can create a just and compassionate society"

You, Dinah!  Come and set me whar de ribber-roads does meet.
De Lord, HE made dese black-jack roots to twis' into a seat.
Umph, dar!  De Lord have mussy on dis blin' ole nigger's feet.
It 'pear to me dis mornin' I kin smell de fust o' June.
I 'clar', I b'lieve dat mockin'-bird could play de fiddle soon!
Dem yonder town-bells sounds like dey was ringin' in de moon.
Well, ef dis nigger IS been blind for fo'ty year or mo',
Dese ears, DEY sees the world, like, th'u' de cracks dat's in de do'.
For de Lord has built dis body wid de windows 'hind and 'fo'.
I know my front ones IS stopped up, and things is sort o' dim,
But den, th'u' DEM, temptation's rain won't leak in on ole Jim!
De back ones show me earth enough, aldo' dey's mons'ous slim.
And as for Hebben, -- bless de Lord, and praise His holy name --

As ef dat cabin hadn't nar' a plank upon de frame!
Who CALL me?  Listen down de ribber, Dinah!  Don't you hyar
Somebody holl'in' ""Hoo, Jim, hoo?""  My Sarah died las' y'ar;

De Debble's comin' round dat bend, he's comin' shuh enuff,
A-splashin' up de water wid his tail and wid his hoof!
I'se pow'ful skeered; but neversomeless I ain't gwine run away:
I'm gwine to stand stiff-legged for de Lord dis blessed day.
YOU screech, and swish de water, Satan!  I'se a gwine to pray.
O hebbenly Marster, what thou willest, dat mus' be jes' so,
And ef Thou hast bespoke de word, some nigger's bound to go.
Den, Lord, please take ole Jim, and lef young Dinah hyar below!
'Scuse Dinah, 'scuse her, Marster; for she's sich a little chile,
She hardly jes' begin to scramble up de homeyard stile,
But dis ole traveller's feet been tired dis many a many a mile.
I'se wufless as de rotten pole of las' year's fodder-stack.
De rheumatiz done bit my bones; you hear 'em crack and crack?
I cain'st sit down 'dout gruntin' like 'twas breakin' o' my back.
What use de wheel, when hub and spokes is warped and split, and rotten?
What use dis dried-up cotton-stalk, when Life done picked my cotton?
I'se like a word dat somebody said, and den done been forgotten.
But, Dinah!  Shuh dat gal jes' like dis little hick'ry tree,
De sap's jes' risin in her; she do grow owdaciouslee --

When Jacob got all underholt, de Lord he answered Yes!
And what for waste de vittles, now, and th'ow away de bread,

Stop; -- ef I don't believe de Debble's gone on up de stream!
Jes' now he squealed down dar; -- hush; dat's a mighty weakly scream!

1807,Emotion,PowerPoemsSonnet150OFromWhatPowerHastThouThisPowerfulMightPoembyWilliamShakespeare,"O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway?
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
That in the very refuse of thy deeds
There is such strength and warrantise of skill
That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,
The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
O, though I love what others do abhor,
With others thou shouldst not abhor my state.
If thy unworthiness raised love in me,
More worthy I to be beloved of thee."
1808,Emotion,PowerPoemsTheLustForPowerIsAnAddictionPoembyFrancisDuggan,"The lust for power is an addiction the Government their own praises do sing
And rubbish their main opposition as to Government they try to cling
The voters bombarded with propaganda right up until election day
The true fact of all politicians is they seldom do mean what they say
The winners take all of the glory and the winners they do celebrate
The prize it is great and worth lying for that's how they feel those who wish to rule the State
The lust for power is an addiction and not a harmless addiction 'twould seem
Without such power some people feel worthless and suffer of low self esteem
Some people become so power hungry that power to their egos is fuel
They feel it is their right to Govern that they have been born to rule
The Opposition as bad as the Government they too want power in the worst way
Any respect to their political opponents they have no desire for to pay
It is all about power and their egos power to them is the best thing of all
Their pride to them is all that matter though pride it can come before a fall."
1809,Emotion,PowerPoemsPowerOfTheSunPoembyPoetryGuy,"The lonliness of the night,
Is matched by the emptiness of my bed.
The emptiness of my heart,
Is equalled by the absence of hope.
The absence of a future,
Is akin to the depth of my need.
The depth of my memories,
Is beaten only by the heat of the Sun."
1810,Emotion,PowerPoemsPowerPoembyEdwinaMatthews,"To some power is guns
To some power is knifes
To some power is the ability to read, and write.
To some power is control
To some power is a fist
To some like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. power was words.
To some power is like a trapped animal trying to get out of a cage.
To some power is love
To some power is art
To some power is money
To me power is knowledge
So what is power to you?"
1811,Emotion,PowerPoemsThePowerOfSongPoembyMichelleTiddy,"When a tiny melody catches your breath
And wonderful lyrics impound your brain
The clarity of a voice stirs your heart
You know you've finally come home
A climbing spirit bursts through the clouds
Sharing emotions without constraint
Turning the key that opens the chambers
Making you believe again
The combination touches your soul
You feel, you explode, you're soaring high
How does this wonderful journey
Affect you so, make you live?
A rare gift stirs the senses so absolutely
A beautiful breeze to make you fly
This my friends is how it feels
It always amazes me, this ride"
1812,Emotion,PowerPoemsThePowerOfTheCrossPoembyBobGotti,"It was a special time indeed, when Christ chose to died upon a tree,
For He didn't die because of a crime, but He died for you and me.
On the morning before He died, as the garden was quiet and still,
He chose to do a work of Love and follow His Father's will.
He told the Disciples to wait and watch as he went away to pray,
But when He returned, He found them all asleep, much to His dismay.
He then went back to pray to The Father, not once but two more times,
Although He wanted the cup to pass he said Father your will not mine.
Filled with anguish He continued to pray to The One in whom He loved,
In so much pain as He prayed, His sweat fell to the ground like blood.
When He returned to the disciples, it was no surprise to The Lord,
As they saw Judas leading a crowd, with each man lifting a sword.
He was arrested that day, for you and I, and lead off to face a trial
While the Apostle who said that he never would, went into denial.
In their grief instead of holding fast to the Only One that mattered,
As The Scriptures clearly stated, the rest of the disciples scattered.
After they regathered, but filled with grief, much to their surprise,
As it was clearly taught by the prophets, The Lord truly did arise.
And as they understood that day, Christ's Resurrection set them free,
Today that same power is available to you, if you only would believe.

1813,Emotion,PowerPoemsThePowerOfIdeasPoembyAnthonyShurlandPhillander,"The power of ideas are immeasurable
They are the hidden treasures which lies
Deep within each and everyone of us
When we take the time to mind them we will find
That they are more precious than diamonds
Ideas which may seem insignificant
Has tremendous power within them
They are the genesis the initiation the foundation
Of all invention and everything which
Is created by humankind
The power of ideas are immeasurable
They have got the power to move mountains
To overcome any obstacle and to make
The seemingly impossible possible
Ideas are the levers which moves and the axis
On which the world revolves
The power of ideas are immeasurable
The power of ideas..."
1814,Emotion,PowerPoemsTheTwentyHossPowerShayPoembyEllisParkerButler,"You have heard of the wonderful one-hoss shay
That was built in such a logical way
It ran a hundred years to a day.
And then, of a sudden, it up and bust,
And all that was left was a mound of dust?
Holmes -- O. W. -- told it well
In a rhyme of his -- what there was to tell --
But the one-hoss shay wasn't ""one, two, three""
With a vehicle once belonged to me.
One hoss? No, sir! Not six nor nine --
Twenty there were in this rig of mine!
Twenty hosses as tough as rocks,
All caged up in a sort of box
That stood jist back of the forward wheels!
Right! She was one of those automobiles
With twenty hosses bottled inside -
Hosses that not only pull but ride!
Wonder what Holmes would have had to say
If the mare had rode in his one-hoss shay!
I reckon the shay would have logicked out
Before the century rolled about.
Well, this big touring car, I say,
Was built just like the one-hoss shay --
Some dependable, logical way --
Flipflaps, dujabs, wheels and things,
Levers, thing-gum-bobs and springs,
Hub, and felloe, and hoss-power chest --
One part just as strong as the rest;
So ""logic is logic,"" as Holmes would say,
And no one part could first give way.
Wonderful vehicle, you'll admit,
With not one flaw in the whole of it;
As long as I had it, I declare
I hadn't one cent to pay for repair,
It couldn't break down because, you see,
It was such a logical symphony.
Now for my tale. We're not so slow
These days as a hundred years ago,
And it's like enough that the one-hoss shay,
Ambling along in its sleepy way,
Should creep a century 'thout a break,
But nowadays we aim to make
A pace that is something like a pace,
And if that old shay got in our race
It would stand the pressure twenty days
And go to the home of played-out shays.
""Logic is logic."" Just figure this out --
For I know just what I'm talking about: --
If a one-hoss vehicle, genus shays,
Will stand our pressure twenty days,
Then, vice versa, a twenty-hoss shay
Should stand the pressure just one day; --
Well, mine is a logical automobile,
From rubber tire to steering wheel.
I bought it one morning at just 10.42,
And the very next morning what did it do,
Right on the second, but up and bust!
Talk of the old shay's pile of dust --
That's not logical; my mobile
Vanished completely! Brass and steel,
Iron and wood and rubber tire
Went right up in a gush of fire,
And in half a minute a gassy smell
Was all I had left by which to tell
I ever owned a touring car, --
And then that vanished, and there you are!
End of my twenty hoss-power shay.
Logic is logic. That's all I say.

Trust built on lies
Holding on to the wound
That will never heal
Beyond repair
Upon the betrayal of a friend.
I only have the strength
For one last word;
Good-bye
Good-bye to sleepless nights
Helplessness in your arms
To a lifetime of your dreams
Power of your screams
There is no strength left in me to fight
Pick your battles
Because you already lost this one
How can I be your friend?
When all that’s left is the strength to say
Good-bye."

Or was myself—too small?"
1818,Emotion,PowerPoemsThePowerOfWordsPoembyLetitiaElizabethLandon,"'Tis a strange mystery, the power of words!
Life is in them, and death. A word can send
The crimson colour hurrying to the cheek.

The current cold and deadly to the heart.
Anger and fear are in them; grief and joy
Are on their sound; yet slight, impalpable:--
A word is but a breath of passing air."

something my stupid past didn’t see.
May the outcome of my experience
allow God to transform me
I Long to be alive
for within I was dead.
Darkness emptiness was my company
and each day I dread.
Walking with a long lost soul
Understanding nothing at hand
I once had a goal
my dreams turned to sand.
I seek the face of soothing comfort
to captivate my vast distressed mind.
I can’t give up on this beautiful life
Hope, I must find.
Thank God I found hope
In the midst of this eerie dark
Pursuing, struggling to find some light
until it penetrates right through my heart.'"

1821,Emotion,PowerPoemsPowerOfSilencePoembyRAJNANDY,"In silence the flower buds gently bloom,
In silence they waft their sweet perfume.
In silence grows the blades of grass,
In silence I pen down my verse.
Speech is silver, silence gold,
Good deeds silently performed,
Is more eloquent than  words!
In silence lovers cuddle and sleep,
True love communicates through
oceans deep!
Look at the mountains towering so high,
Clouds kiss their tops and silently
float by!
In silence the monks move  their  prayer
beads,
In silence  they perform their charitable deeds.
In silence  the  sun  rises and shine,
In silence the moon beams softly  smiles.
In silence my God I invoke,
In silence rise my incense  smoke.
In silence my inner-self  unfolds,
In silent prayer my hands  I  fold.
In silence, with Him I communicate,
In silence I surrender to my fate.
In silence I beg Him to make me whole,
In silence to Him I surrender my soul!
In our noise polluted world, silence is
difficult to find,
But I know, one day, this Silence  shall be
mine!"

If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,
As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,
She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill

The dim and weary witness of life's race,

Through that same soul's distracting lethargy,
The patient angel waiting for a place
In the new Heavens,--because nor sin nor woe,
Nor God's infliction, nor death's neighbourhood,
Nor all which others viewing, turn to go,
Nor all of which makes me tired of all, self-viewed,--
Nothing repels thee,...Dearest, teach me so
To pour out gratitude, as thou dost, good!"

Up and down to run and win
Circled race yet powers in

Fins of fans are ran to pound
Wind with fin to spin around
Blowing gusts at me I found
2-d borders power bound
Atoms bound to different blight
Breaking in from left to right
Up and down from any sight
Front to back the powers fight
This would seem to beam the way
How power rolls in wild stray
So why do we confine its day
To running in this 2-d way?"
1827,Emotion,PowerPoemsWeGiveThemOurPowerPoembyFrancisDuggan,"From them only negative stuff we do hear
They tell us who to trust and tell us who to fear
We want to believe the lies to us they tell
They promise Utopia and give us Earthly Hell.
We want to believe every word that they say
And for to cling to power they create us and they
We help to create our own reality
The blind in the light of day never do see.
Their pre election promises they never do keep
We give them our power and we follow like sheep
They tell us who to fear and them we believe
And they laugh behind our backs and us they deceive.
Through false patriotism to power they do cling
And the praises of war heroes they gladly do sing
They cling on to power and they cheat and they lie
Whilst in the wars they created the innocents die."
1828,Emotion,PowerPoemsPowerCorruptsAndAbsolutePowerCorruptsAbsolutelyPoembyMuzahidulReza,"Once in jungle a rat was very frightened by a cat
Somehow it escaped from the attack,
There the rat met a Saint and prayed
To be a large cat,
So, it was turned into a cat
And it began to kill rats,
But dogs often used to chase it,
Being unhappy it prayed to be a mighty dog,
So it was then turned into a big dog
And it began to torture the cats,
But tigers began to chase it
So, again it prayed to be a tiger,
Finally the Saint turned it into a tiger,
This tiger began to feel very mighty
That made it so proud of power,
Ill thoughts entered its brain heavily
It planned to attack and kill the Saint;
Some evidences made the Saint understand
Instantly he turned it into the pre-rat."

1830,Emotion,PowerPoemsThePowerOfPrayerWhenAppliedToTheTheoryOfRelativityPoembyTedSheridan,"The old man had been channeling Albert for days
He had managed to make contact with him
while taking his morning constitution in the back
behind his custom built plywood paneled trailer
His wife's (actually his cousin's)  garden was doing extremely well
The sweet corn was high and the beans were really coming in...
The old guy had been unable to sleep for weeks up till then
This one burning question kept eating at his psychic
and the old man thought only an Einstein would know
If when in a person's life there is a spiritual void
Will Evil then be all which can fill his heart?
Or was there power enough in prayer to save him?
The answer came as a shocker....
When Albert who had taken the liberty of enlisting some help
from six of the twelve Apostles...
Spoke to him late last night....The old man was
taking a piss on the rhubarb and collard greens
He claims it keeps the varmints from eating them greens
'Old man' the voices of the combined seven called....
Bartholomew acting as spokesperson for the group....
Said....
'Two protons stuck together have less mass than two single separate protons'
Perplexed the old guy scratched his head with his free hand and asked,
'What does this mean to me?
To which there was only the sound of dead silence
and that of his stream hitting the broad leaf of the rhubarb....

Stand by the ocean, shouting, trying to
drown out the cry of the waves
with your voice.
Neptune, god of the sea, powerful while powerless,
in your human psychology
promises you your failure.
You-
Throw yourself to the waves, let go
of all you hold to be true,
find yourself floating.
Power in the waves, in the sun beating down, in the
wind whipping along the shore,
throwing sand like a child throwing a tantrum.

Leave the shore, laughing at jokes
of no importance, leaving behind

For tis only by good example that one can ever lead
And many with power over others their power they do abuse
And for those who abuse others there cannot be an excuse.
If you wish to be a leader some sort of form of power you crave
And what it takes to be a great leader is to be understanding kind and brave
But leaders with such qualities to say the least seem rare
To some very ordinary people they do favourably compare.
For to have power over others a good person does not desire
And many power hungry people are those we should not admire
Power over others and personal power are different from night and day
We all do need some personal power for to serve survival's way.
To have power over others is something one can do without
And on those who desire such powers one has to cast some doubt
They seem to be control freaks with darkness of the soul
The lives of other people they do need to control."
1833,Emotion,PowerPoemsPowerPowerPowerPoembyEdwardKofiLouis,"Power! Power! ! Power! ! !
Madness;
Mankind on earth!
Wolves in Power,
Destroying the whole world,
With their evil acts.
Power! Power! ! Power! ! !

Power! Power! ! Power! ! !

1834,Emotion,PowerPoemsPowerConferredByMoneyPoembyJuliusBabarinsa,"It is a fact that human beings cannot live without money
People go to work everyday because of money
The more money we have the greater the influence
The more influence we have the greater the control
The more control we have the greater the power
Therefore with lots of money, we acquire power
We classify some people as rich, affluent and prosperous
This is because they have lots and lots of money
By the way - what is this power conferred by money?
In other words - how powerful is money?
Several people agree that money is everything
Lack of money can lead to divorce
Labour unions will go on strike for money
Political campaign is doomed without money
Businesses close down when they have no money
Consultants sell their services for money
Without money we cannot acquire any property
In some countries, access to superior medical services
Is not possible if you do not have lots of money
Also in a number of societies, the caliber of education
You can have depends on how wealthy your parents are
To have money power is to have authority
Oh! Money, what are we going to do without you?
Many believe that money talks everywhere
Whoever has more money makes the loudest noise
The power conferred by money turn few people
To be labeled as the movers and shakers
Does this mean that the poor have less power?
Take a closer look at the society in general
The answer is everywhere and in all places"
1835,Emotion,PowerPoemsKissingPowerPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"Kisses upon kisses
Teases upon teases
Certain madness fills the air
It is termed as love I fear
Kisses upon kisses
Teases upon teases
Touches upon touches
My hearts broken pieces
Are once again at peace
Kisses upon kisses
Teases upon teases
Touches upon touches
Flattery upon Flattery
Love always sparkles without batteries
Lips upon lips
First a taste of your tongues tip
Admiration induces exploration
While love ignites imagination
I can feel your kissing power
And the sensational effect it showers
I can feel your kissing power
As you handle me like a delicate flower
Week legs
Pleasure begs
I can feel your kissing power
While you kiss me by the hour
Don't stop!
Be my hero not my flop!"

U did not love me
U never knew me
U never understood me
even you have never ever  tried
Finally, simply u left me
But now all I can say is
I love you
because this is something I have no power upon to

because this is not something I usually do"
1837,Emotion,PowerPoemsCircesPowerPoembyLouiseGluck,"I never turned anyone into a pig.
Some people are pigs; I make them
Look like pigs.
I'm sick of your world
That lets the outside disguise the inside. Your men weren't bad men;
Undisciplined life
Did that to them. As pigs,
Under the care of
Me and my ladies, they
Sweetened right up.
Then I reversed the spell, showing you my goodness
As well as my power. I saw
We could be happy here,
As men and women are
When their needs are simple. In the same breath,
I foresaw your departure,
Your men with my help braving
The crying and pounding sea. You think
A few tears upset me? My friend,
Every sorceress is
A pragmatist at heart; nobody sees essence who can't
Face limitation. If I wanted only to hold you
I could hold you prisoner."
1838,Emotion,PowerPoemsPowerOfWordPoembyKholekileMonakali,"A Word is capable of anything
It is capable of changing enemies

It is capable of penetrating

It is capable of changing the impossibility

It is capable of uniting man and woman into

It is capable of changing the Atheist into
Christian.
It is capable of changing illiterate into

It is capable of changing political crisis into
independence.
Beginning today let us not just utter words
but live by them, let your words be sweet and
caring to  all those around you.
Because we never know how far reaching
something we may think, say or do today

That do not do the thing, they most do show,
Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,

1840,Emotion,PowerPoemsThePowerOfArmiesIsAVisibleThingPoembyWilliamWordsworth,"The power of Armies is a visible thing,
Formal, and circumscribed in time and space;
But who the limits of that power shall trace
Which a brave People into light can bring
Or hide, at will,--for freedom combating
By just revenge inflamed? No foot may chase,
No eye can follow, to a fatal place
That power, that spirit, whether on the wing
Like the strong wind, or sleeping like the wind
Within its awful caves.--From year to year
Springs this indigenous produce far and near;
No craft this subtle element can bind,
Rising like water from the soil, to find
In every nook a lip that it may cheer."
1841,Emotion,PowerPoemsAlexandersFeastOrThePowerOfMusicPoembyJohnDryden,"'Twas at the royal feast for Persia won
By Philip's warlike son—
Aloft in awful state
The godlike hero sate
On his imperial throne;
His valiant peers were placed around,
Their brows with roses and with myrtles bound
(So should desert in arms be crowned);
The lovely Thais by his side
Sate like a blooming eastern bride
In flower of youth and beauty's pride:—
Happy, happy, happy pair!
None but the brave
None but the brave
None but the brave deserves the fair!
Timotheus placed on high
Amid the tuneful quire
With flying fingers touched the lyre;
The trembling notes ascend the sky
And heavenly joys inspire.
The song began from Jove
Who left his blissful seats above—
Such is the power of mighty love!
A dragon's fiery form belied the god
Sublime on radiant spires he rode
When he to fair Olympia prest,
And while he sought her snowy breast,
Then round her slender waist he curled,
And stamped an image of himself, a sovereign of the world.
- The listening crowd admire the lofty sound!
A present deity! they shout around:
A present deity! the vaulted roofs rebound!
With ravished ears
The monarch hears,
Assumes the god,
Affects to nod,
And seems to shake the spheres.
The praise of Bacchus then the sweet musician sung,
Of Bacchus ever fair and ever young:
The jolly god in triumph comes!
Sound the trumpets, beat the drums!
Flushed with a purple grace
He shows his honest face:
Now give the hautboys breath; he comes, he comes!
Bacchus, ever fair and young,
Drinking joys did first ordain;
Bacchus' blessings are a treasure,
Drinking is the soldier's pleasure:
Rich the treasure,
Sweet the pleasure,
Sweet is pleasure after pain.
Soothed with the sound, the king grew vain;
Fought all his battles o'er again,
And thrice he routed all his foes, and thrice he slew the slain.
The master saw the madness rise,
His glowing cheeks, his ardent eyes;
And while he Heaven and Earth defied
Changed his hand and checked his pride.
He chose a mournful Muse
Soft pity to infuse:
He sung Darius great and good,
By too severe a fate
Fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen,
Fallen from his high estate,
And weltering in his blood;
Deserted, at his utmost need,
By those his former bounty fed;
On the bare earth exposed he lies
With not a friend to close his eyes.
- With downcast looks the joyless victor sate,
Revolving in his altered soul
The various turns of Chance below;
And now and then a sigh he stole,
And tears began to flow.
The mighty master smiled to see
That love was in the next degree;
'Twas but a kindred-sound to move,
For pity melts the mind to love.
Softly sweet, in Lydian measures
Soon he soothed his soul to pleasures.
War, he sung, is toil and trouble,
Honour but an empty bubble;
Never ending, still beginning,
Fighting still, and still destroying;
If the world be worth thy winning,
Think, O think, it worth enjoying:
Lovely Thais sits beside thee,
Take the good the gods provide thee!
- The many rend the skies with loud applause;
So Love was crowned, but Music won the cause.
The prince, unable to conceal his pain,
Gazed on the fair
Who caused his care,
And sighed and looked, sighed and looked,
Sighed and looked, and sighed again:
At length with love and wine at once opprest
The vanquished victor sunk upon her breast.
Now strike the golden lyre again:
A louder yet, and yet a louder strain!
Break his bands of sleep asunder
And rouse him like a rattling peal of thunder.
Hark, hark! the horrid sound
Has raised up his head:
As awaked from the dead
And amazed he stares around.
Revenge, revenge, Timotheus cries,
See the Furies arisel
See the snakes that they rear
How they hiss in their hair,
And the sparkles that flash from their eyes!
Behold a ghastly band,
Each a torch in his hand!
Those are Grecian ghosts, that in battle were slain
And unburied remain
Inglorious on the plain:
Give the vengeance due
To the valiant crew!
Behold how they toss their torches on high,
How they point to the Persian abodes
And glittering temples of their hostile gods.
- The princes applaud with a furious joy:
And the King seized a flambeau with zeal to destroy;
Thais led the way
To light him to his prey,
And like another Helen, fired another Troy!
- Thus, long ago,
Ere heaving bellows learned to blow,
While organs yet were mute,
Timotheus, to his breathing flute
And sounding lyre,
Could swell the soul to rage, or kindle soft desire.
At last divine Cecilia came,
Inventress of the vocal frame;
The sweet enthusiast from her sacred store
Enlarged the former narrow bounds,
And added length to solemn sounds,
With Nature's mother-wit, and arts unknown before.
- Let old Timotheus yield the prize
Or both divide the crown;
He raised a mortal to the skies;
She drew an angel down!"

One whisper can wake the dream.
One tree can start a forest,
One bird can herald spring.
One smile begins a friendship,
One moment can make one fall in luv.
One star can guide a ship at sea,
One word can frame the goal
One vote can change a nation,
One sunbeam lights a room
One candle wipes out darkness,
One laugh will conquer gloom.
One step must start each journey.
One word must start each prayer.
One hope will raise our spirits,
One touch can show you care.
One voice can speak with wisdom,
One heart can know what's true,
One life can make a difference,
You see, it's up to you!"
1843,Emotion,PowerPoemsPowerAndMoneyPoembyFrancisDuggan,"A bad habit they form as a young girl or boy
To have power over others some people enjoy
With personal power some are not satisfied
Their desire for top job they don't try for to hide
They need more than personal power to be seen to succeed
It is all about money and all about greed
One might say they do have big egos to feed
The more money they have the more they seem to need
Power and money are siblings it does seem that way
And money speaks every language some are known to say
The non greedy and non power hungry people one has to admire
The lust for large sums of money or power over others they never desire
They are not the type for to put others down
Or wish to be known as the best in the town."

until some tiny part of it

'til at last you are near heaven's gate

This, then, the freedom that I seek

To strike off lingering chains of doubt

1846,Emotion,PowerPoemsAPoetLosesHisPowerForPoetryPoembyShalomFreedman,"A POET LOSES HIS POWER FOR POETRY
A poet loses his power for poetry
He can put down words
But they no longer have poetry in them
Something of the feeling of what real poetry is
is gone.
He strives
He writes again and again
He puts words down in the forms and in the shapes his poems usually take
But he has no poetry in him
He has lost what he is
And all he can do
is strive again and again
Word after word
Silence after silence
To hear within himself again
A voice he does not have.
The poet is writing poetry
And it is not poetry
The poet is dead
And he is pretending to be alive
Is this a poem?
Is he a poet
Is he dead?
Is he alive?"
1847,Emotion,PowerPoemsPowerOfLovePoembyAnneBrontë,"Love, indeed thy strength is mighty
Thus, alone, such strife to bear --
Three 'gainst one, and never ceasing --
Death, and Madness, and Despair!
'Tis not my own strength has saved me;
Health, and hope, and fortitude,
But for love, had long since failed me;
Heart and soul had sunk subdued.
Often, in my wild impatience,
I have lost my trust in Heaven,
And my soul has tossed and struggled,
Like a vessel tempest-driven;
But the voice of my beloved
In my ear has seemed to say --
'O, be patient if thou lov'st me!'
And the storm has passed away.
When outworn with weary thinking,
Sight and thought were waxing dim,
And my mind began to wander,
And my brain began to swim,
Then those hands outstretched to save me
Seemed to call me back again --
Those dark eyes did so implore me
To resume my reason's reign,
That I could not but remember
How her hopes were fixed on me,
And, with one determined effort,
Rose, and shook my spirit free.
When hope leaves my weary spirit --
All the power to hold it gone --
That loved voice so loudly prays me,
'For my sake, keep hoping on,'
That, at once my strength renewing,
Though Despair had crushed me down,
I can burst his bonds asunder,
And defy his deadliest frown.
When, from nights of restless tossing,
Days of gloom and pining care,
Pain and weakness, still increasing,
Seem to whisper 'Death is near,'
And I almost bid him welcome,
Knowing he would bring release,
Weary of this restless struggle --
Longing to repose in peace,
Then a glance of fond reproval
Bids such selfish longings flee
And a voice of matchless music
Murmurs 'Cherish life for me!'
Roused to newborn strength and courage,
Pain and grief, I cast away,
Health and life, I keenly follow,
Mighty Death is held at bay.
Yes, my love, I will be patient!
Firm and bold my heart shall be:
Fear not -- though this life is dreary,
I can bear it well for thee.
Let our foes still rain upon me
Cruel wrongs and taunting scorn;
'Tis for thee their hate pursues me,
And for thee, it shall be borne!
A.E."

With your trophy wife
Do you feel fulfilled?
In your comfort zone
Are you bored to the bone?
Has your spirit been killed?
Do you dance in the rain?
Do you feel the pain
That makes you know you're alive?
All things work to a plan
You're a corporate man
For wealth and power you strive.
Your materialist god
Has an iron ruling rod
No room for free thought.
In the Brave New World
Your flag is unfurled
Your status you've bought.
All the things that you've promised
Have you really been honest?
People's lives are your tools.
And when you are wrong
You then sing a new song
I think 'Who are the fools? '
Have you ever been loved?
Is your handshake steel gloved?
Can you really unwind?
Have you drank to excess?
Is your true happiness
In your business like mind?
A blip in the market
Turns your mood very dark, it
Puts your nose out of joint.
Who do you want to be?
All the best things are free
You're missing the point."

Because temptation is so hopelessly strong
While the power of right is substantially hard
You must overcome the power of wrong
But the power in you is much greater than all
In you, his power is born
So when the unfairness of life takes your power away
Remember to whom the power belongs..."

Sinking into slumber deep,
It's not so restful as it seems.
Agony's relived time and again,
Magnified by the helplessness
I feel in my dreams and then
I mourn lost love and happiness
I find more relief in time than sleep,
Although I still relive my loss,
I feel the pain less acutely,
Still there, but not as it once was."

Battling against its stalwart stone,
Devouring its surface bit by bit,
And leaving it gullible and prone.
The rocks hit back with warlike will,
Facing the churning water's rage,
With ceaseless power, the ocean spars,
And tries, at all times to upstage.
So firm and strong the crags were formed,
And tough and sheer its rock face stands,
But slow erosion there will always be,
As the bluff gives way to the deep's demands."

1854,Emotion,PowerPoemsThePowerOfSongPoembyFriedrichSchiller,"The foaming stream from out the rock
With thunder roar begins to rush,--
The oak falls prostrate at the shock,
And mountain-wrecks attend the gush.
With rapturous awe, in wonder lost,
The wanderer hearkens to the sound;
From cliff to cliff he hears it tossed,
Yet knows not whither it is bound:
'Tis thus that song's bright waters pour
From sources never known before.
In union with those dreaded ones
That spin life's thread all-silently,
Who can resist the singer's tones?
Who from his magic set him free?
With wand like that the gods bestow,
He guides the heaving bosom's chords,
He steeps it in the realms below,
He bears it, wondering, heavenward,
And rocks it, 'twixt the grave and gay,
On feeling's scales that trembling sway.
As when before the startled eyes
Of some glad throng, mysteriously,
With giant-step, in spirit-guise,
Appears a wondrous deity,
Then bows each greatness of the earth
Before the stranger heaven-born,
Mute are the thoughtless sounds of mirth,
While from each face the mask is torn,
And from the truth's triumphant might
Each work of falsehood takes to flight.
So from each idle burden free,
When summoned by the voice of song,
Man soars to spirit-dignity,
Receiving force divinely strong:
Among the gods is now his home,
Naught earthly ventures to approach--
All other powers must now be dumb,
No fate can on his realms encroach;
Care's gloomy wrinkles disappear,
Whilst music's charms still linger here,
As after long and hopeless yearning,
And separation's bitter smart,
A child, with tears repentant burning,
Clings fondly to his mother's heart--
So to his youthful happy dwelling,
To rapture pure and free from stain,
All strange and false conceits expelling,
Song guides the wanderer back again,
In faithful Nature's loving arm,
From chilling precepts to grow warm."
1855,Emotion,PowerPoemsDevastatingPowerPoembyUriahHamilton,"I happen to be terrified
By cut-throat competition
And sinister backroom deals
Rendering all treasures and rewards
To the obscenely decadent and rich
While the land I love
Descends into a trash heap
Where the poor and dispossessed must weep.
.
There has to be revolution
And the turning of everything
Upside down!
The politics of cruelty
Must be supplanted by compassion,
There must be an underground reaction
To the overt violence and greed
Of those in devastating power
Who currently hold the keys in this dark hour
To the prison cell of this existence."

Than if let loose, 'twere wholly infinite.
He could have made an endless sea by this,
But then it had not been a sea of bliss.
Did waters from the centre to the skies
Ascend, 'twould drown whatever else we prize.
The ocean bounded in a finite shore,
Is better far because it is no more.
No use nor glory would in that be seen,
His power made it endless in esteem.
Had not the Sun been bounded in its sphere,
Did all the world in one fair flame appear,
And were that flame a real Infinite
'Twould yield no profit, splendor, nor delight.
Its corps confined, and beams extended be
Effects of Wisdom in the Deity.
One star made infinite would all exclude,
An earth made infinite could ne'er be viewed:
But one being fashioned for the other's sake,
He, bounding all, did all most useful make
And which is best, in profit and delight
Tho' not in bulk, they all are infinite."

When the wind blows, and the trees sway.
God speaks and has much to say.
When the snowflakes fall and glisten.
God whispers, we must listen.
When the earth trembles and opens to swallow.
God tells us, there may be no tomorrow.
When the sea lifts and the waters tower.
God warns all of his great power.
When the sounds of thunder are heard.
God insists we follow his word.
When the funnel winds shatter our existence
God gives us tremendous resistence.
When we witness the forces of nature.
There is no doubt of it’s creator.
God reigns in heaven and rules the earth.
We shall remain in awe, of his worth.

1863,Emotion,PowerPoemsASweetPowerPoembyMaryWismer,"When we would convince men of any error by
the strength of truth, let us additionally pour
the sweet balm of love upon their heads. Truth
and love are two of the most powerful things
in the world; and when they both go together,
they cannot easily be withstood. The golden
beams of truth, and the silken cords of love,
twisted together, will draw men on with a
sweet power, whether they will or not.
Let us take heed we do not sometimes call that
'zeal for God and His gospel' which is nothing else
but our own tempestuous and stormy passion.
True zeal is a sweet, heavenly, and gentle flame,
which makes us active for God-but always within
the sphere of love. It never calls for fire from heaven
to consume those who differ a little from us. It
strives to save the soul-but hurts not the body.
True zeal is a loving thing, and makes us always
active to edification, and not to destruction.

1864,Emotion,PowerPoemsHadIThePowerThatHaveTheWillPoembyRobertLouisStevenson,"HAD I the power that have the will,
The enfeebled will - a modern curse -
This book of mine should blossom still
A perfect garden-ground of verse.
White placid marble gods should keep
Good watch in every shadowy lawn;
And from clean, easy-breathing sleep
The birds should waken me at dawn.
- A fairy garden; - none the less
Throughout these gracious paths of mine
All day there should be free access
For stricken hearts and lives that pine;
And by the folded lawns all day -
No idle gods for such a land -
All active Love should take its way
With active Labour hand in hand."
1865,Emotion,PowerPoemsThePowerOfArtPoembyGeorgeSantayana,"Not human art, but living gods alone
Can fashion beauties that by changing live,--
Her buds to spring, his fruits to autumn give,
To earth her fountains in her heart of stone;
But these in their begetting are o'erthrown,
Nor may the sentenced minutes find reprieve;
And summer in the blush of joy must grieve
To shed his flaunting crown of petals blown.
We to our works may not impart our breath,
Nor them with shifting light of life array;
We show but what one happy moment saith;
Yet may our hands immortalize the day
When life was sweet, and save from utter death
The sacred past that should not pass away."
1866,Emotion,PowerPoemsThePowerToBeTrueToYouPoembyEmilyDickinson,"464
The power to be true to You,
Until upon my face
The Judgment push his Picture—
Presumptuous of Your Place—
Of This—Could Man deprive Me—
Himself—the Heaven excel—
Whose invitation—Yours reduced
Until it showed too small—"
1867,Emotion,PowerPoemsCandlePowerPoembyWilliamFDougherty,"The unction cools my brow; the candle shines
and braids a line of sacramental brede;
the priest half-chants the text, and makes the signs,
jogging my mind with the redemptive creed
I learned to lisp in church. A night-shift nurse
shows up with rosary beads and borrowed shawl:
I squeeze my morphine pump; the pain is worse.
A gurney clatters down the empty hall.
I wonder what my blur of meaning meant
to warrant such precautionary flush;
I wonder why the candle's Sunday scent
expands and cloys the sterile room. A hush
folds up all sound; the candle snuffs its flame:
a wisp absconds with my stowaway name."
1868,Emotion,PowerPoemsHesComingBackInPowerPoembyBobGotti,"Jesus is coming to set all straight and you may have no time to wait.
For no one knows the day or hour when He’ll return in all His Power.
And every eye will see that day when all His power He does display.
The power He set aside for me when He chose to die upon that tree.
He had the power to save His life but He chose to be our sacrifice.
But unlike a sacrifice that lay dead, The Lord my friend rose again.
And in the view of many men, back up to Heaven Christ did ascend.
As they looked intently in the sky, they may have asked how and why.
Then two angels appeared on the way with the following words to say,
This same Jesus that did ascend is coming back the same way again.
From this you and I should learn we should be looking for His return.
To believers Christ sent His Power to teach about that awesome hour,
Although Christ died, He rose again, to become the Savior of all men.
The power He could have used was a power that He could not lose.
Jesus Christ set aside His Majesty, but as God, retained His Deity.
He will return in Total Majesty and again, every single eye will see.
Many on that day will perish refusing to embrace The Lord we cherish,
As Christ destroys the man of sin, with the brightness of His coming.
While men who wait in every nation, to them He brings His Salvation.
It may be today or tomorrow, so embrace Him now and have no sorrow.

1869,Emotion,PowerPoemsOneGreatPowerPoembyRameshTA,"Bead-String in one hand and Book in another hand
Goddess Saraswathi sits on a White Lotus
Victoriously invoking art with her beautiful Veena
Eternally divine notes infinite
To grace the ardent one with knowledge to stand in this world
And have a permanent place in that world!
Sitting on a Pink Lotus Goddess Lakshmi shines bright
In all her glory wearing Ornaments of Gold and Diamonds
Gracing the suitably great persons with
Progress, prosperity and wealth;
Briefly, beautiful Sri Lakshmi symbolizes all
Wealth, comfort and jollity wherever she is present!
Goddess Sakti majestically sits on the Red Lotus with
A Trisul in one hand and a Tambourine in another hand
Ready to slay down the formidable foes,
Who act arrogantly against dharma in the world;
Also, without Sakthi no one can survive fighting
Courageously against adharma in the world!
So, Saraswathi is the source and for the development of
Knowledge for everyone in the world;
Lakshmi is the source and for the development of
Wealth for everyone in the world;
And Sakti is the source and for the development of
Power for everyone in the world!
Without knowledge creation of any kind
Cannot be good and great;
Without wealth protection of lives
Cannot last longer;
Without power destruction of evil
Cannot be perfectly complete!
To accomplish those aspects the Consorts of these Goddesses,
Brahma, Vishnu and Siva are there respectively
Looking after the duties of Creation, Protection and Destruction
Both in the world and in the Universe
In many Forms of Incarnations variously pointing out
The One All Pervading Great Power!
Four Vedas in the four hands of the four headed Brahma
Sits on a beautiful Lotus Flower,
Whose stem is connected to
The abdominal navel point of Lord Vishnu
Doing the duty of creation of Stars, planets
And living beings in the Universe!
Lord Vishnu reclining over the five headed Snake Bed
Comforted by the hand pressings of Lakshmi of His leg calves,
And surrounded by the Gods of Heaven ponders over
The ways to protect the Good against the Bad
Keeping ever ready in His hands weapons like
Chakra, Conch and Club to do His duty of protecting dharma!
Sitting on the highest Snow Mountain top
In a best possible yogic position
With a String of Beads, Holy Water Pot
And Trisul in His hands
Lord Siva coolly calculates each and everything
And performs His duty of destruction in time!"
1870,Emotion,PowerPoemsPowerOfWordsPoembyRayLucero,"Written words are powerful
Able to influence and elicit change
More powerful yet are spoken words
Birthed in the mind, delivered through
Tongue, diaphragm and lungs
Working in concert to deliver voice
Intelligent vibrations creating reality
Somewhere an angry someone screams
“I hate you”
Words moving through space unhindered
Past countless stars in countless galaxies
Wreaking endless havoc on God’s Creation
Thinking with one's heart before speaking
Glorifies the positive power of words
Destruction ceases, balance restored

1871,Emotion,PowerPoemsPowerIsPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"Power is love and strength
Showered on others at any length
Power is a woman
Standing delicately like a flower
Power is intelligence
Without pretence that is so intense
Power is knowledge
We all acknowledge
As politicians take the oath and pledge
Along comes the usual greed
With the desire to feed
On weaknesses with speed
So careful, take heed!
Before you dry up and bleed
Power knows no friends
Powers shows and sends
A message of uneven ends
Power is spoken words
When battles and wars are won
Without the need of the gun
Power is the human touch
That soothes the heart so much
While we observe, stand and watch
But on the whole
Power is control
Its one and only ultimate goal!"
1872,Emotion,PowerPoemsThePowerOfFriendshipPoembyJasonAnderson,"Pain is the feeling you endure when you are alone,
It is great torture when you have no friends at all
Pain is the feeling you endure when you break a bone,
You endure great humiliation and pain when you slip and fall
However, you possess the spirit to get back on your feet,
Even if the path in front of you becomes too rough
There will be friends along the path that you will meet,
That will help make you become strong and tough
Also, they will help cure you when you are sick,
They will be friends with you through thick and thin
And they will never think about playing a mean joke nor trick,
Your friends will be as close to you as your own kin
Now I know I cannot quit during the fight,
Because I know my friends will help me see the light."

1874,Emotion,PowerPoemsThePowerOfWomanPoembyFriedrichSchiller,"Mighty art thou, because of the peaceful charms of thy presence;
That which the silent does not, never the boastful can do.
Vigor in man I expect, the law in its honors maintaining,
But, through the graces alone, woman e'er rules or should rule.
Many, indeed, have ruled through the might of the spirit and action,
But then thou noblest of crowns, they were deficient in thee.
No real queen exists but the womanly beauty of woman;
Where it appears, it must rule; ruling because it appears!"
1875,Emotion,PowerPoemsRememberHimWhomPassionsPowerPoembyGeorgeGordonByron,"Remember him, whom Passion's power
Severely---deeply---vainly proved:
Remember thou that dangerous hour,
When neither fell, though both were loved.
That yielding breast, that melting eye,
Too much invited to be blessed:
That gentle prayer, that pleading sigh,
The wilder wish reproved, repressed.
Oh! let me feel that all I lost
But saved thee all that Conscience fears;
And blush for every pang it cost
To spare the vain remorse of years.
Yet think of this when many a tongue,
Whose busy accents whisper blame,
Would do the heart that loved thee wrong,
And brand a nearly blighted name.
Think that, whate'er to others, thou
Hast seen each selfish thought subdued:
I bless thy purer soul even now,
Even now, in midnight solitude.
Oh, God! that we had met in time,
Our hearts as fond, thy hand more free;
When thou hadst loved without a crime,
And I been less unworthy thee!
Far may thy days, as heretofore,
From this our gaudy world be past!
And that too bitter moment o'er,
Oh! may such trial be thy last.
This heart, alas! perverted long,
Itself destroyed might there destroy;
To meet thee in the glittering throng,
Would wake Presumption's hope of joy.
Then to the things whose bliss or woe,
Like mine, is wild and worthless all,
That world resign---such scenes forego,
Where those who feel must surely fall.
Thy youth, thy charms, thy tenderness---
Thy soul from long seclusion pure;
From what even here hath passed, may guess
What there thy bosom must endure.
Oh! pardon that imploring tear,
Since not by Virtue shed in vain,
My frenzy drew from eyes so dear;
For me they shall not weep again.
Though long and mournful must it be,
The thought that we no more may meet;
Yet I deserve the stern decree,
And almost deem the sentence sweet.
Still---had I loved thee less---my heart
Had then less sacrificed to thine;
It felt not half so much to part
As if its guilt had made thee mine."
1876,Emotion,PowerPoemsSonnetXcivTheyThatHavePowerToHurtAndWillDoNonePoembyWilliamShakespeare,"They that have power to hurt and will do none,
That do not do the thing they most do show,
Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,
Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow:
They rightly do inherit heaven's graces
And husband nature's riches from expense;
They are the lords and owners of their faces,
Others but stewards of their excellence.
The summer's flower is to the summer sweet
Though to itself it only live and die,
But if that flower with base infection meet,
The basest weed outbraves his dignity:
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds."
1877,Emotion,PowerPoemsBeyondThePowerOfYourPrayersPoembyTedSheridan,"I am beyond the help of prayer...I am in the abyss of a double life
One which I brought upon myself and another Fate has dealt me

Its lies and deceit washed me in a digestive saliva
Breaking down all of my defenses and leaving me ready
To become nothing more than excrement...
Prayers can't help that kind of shit....

1878,Emotion,PowerPoemsOThouDreadPowerPoembyRobertBurns,"O Thou dread Power, who reign'st above,
I know thou wilt me hear,
When for this scene of peace and love
I make this prayer sincere.
The hoary Sire - the mortal stroke,
Long, long be pleas'd to spare;
To bless his little filial flock,
And show what good men are.
She, who her lovely offspring eyes
With tender hopes and fears,
O bless her with a mother's joys,
But spare a mother's tears!
Their hope, their stay, their darling youth,
In manhood's dawning blush,
Bless him, Thou God of love and truth,
Up to a parent's wish.
The seauteous, seraph sister-band -
With earnest tears I pray -
Thou know'st the snares on ev'ry hand,
Guide Thou their steps alway.
When, soon or late, they reach that coast,
O'er Life's rough ocean driven,
May they rejoice, no wand'rer lost,
A family in Heaven"
1879,Emotion,PowerPoemsTheLustForPowerAndMoneyPoembyFrancisDuggan,"The lust for power and money to corruption lead
And some cheat and lie to satisfy their greed
And big Corporations do not have a soul
The avarice that afflicts them their thinking control.
The distribution of wealth as ever seems so unfair
And thousands grow poorer for every new millionaire
Oil tycoons and arms dealers make millions every day
Whilst thousands are dying of hunger like flowers in decay.
To be born of poor parents is their only crime
And they look thin, old and gray though only in their prime
In refugee camps they are forced to reside
In a Land ravaged by drought and by war men destroyed.
'Tis true power can be a corruptible thing
Of the wealthy and famous some poets only sing
Why laud people who have far more than enough
When millions are homeless and have to sleep rough.
The lust for power seems to be thriving of late
And only the wealthy and famous the media celebrate
Whilst each day thousands die of hunger doesn''t life seem unfair
In a World where empathy and compassion are rare."
1880,Emotion,PowerPoemsThePoliticalPowerGamePoembyFrancisDuggan,"The little power we have to others we give away
They rule our lives for us we go by what they say
The media they control and only lies from them we hear
They warn of terrorists and terrorism and fill our hearts with fear
Of people we do not know or may never even meet
They even have us looking out for terrorists as we walk down the street
Each stranger that we meet we look on with mistrust
Though they may be kind of heart and they may be good and just.
They are our enemy yet we see them as a friend
For their Political survival on our fears they do depend
And those we see as our enemy their leaders are the same
They instill in them a fear of us they too play the Political power game.
We are ruled by self centred men and us they do deceive
When they tell us who to fear them we want to believe
They create us and they and to conquer they divide
And tell us with a smirk we have God on our side.
To lie to cling to power to them is not a sin
Some call it propaganda and others call it spin
And when our so called enemy civilians die in a bombing raid collateral damage is what they say
Is it right that loss of Human life be dismissed in such a way?
The little power we have to ourselves we never keep
To the power hungry we give it away we value it as cheap
They lubricate our fears to insure they cling to power
In a garden full of noxious weeds you may not find a flower."
1881,Emotion,PowerPoemsThePowerOfOnePoembyMaryHavran,"One second might not tell
When held against an hour
One hour might not count
When weighed against a day
One day may not matter
When considering a life
One word may mean little
From the conversation whole
One line may not be missed
When stricken from the book
One thought may be dismissed
In comprehension of the mind
One flaw might be overlooked
When evaluating character
One mistake means little
When summing up a man
One sin may be forgiven
In the judgement of a soul
So how is it a single glance
Can make one wither so?"

Power or no power
Your words carry it further
Your image, in public eyes, gets it stronger
You become recognized and acceptable figure
You damage your own personality
And get nowhere to the reality
Your artificial leanings worsens the image
No one takes you seriously in terms of critical phase
The dynasty rule goes in your disfavor
Your public utterances don't earn you any favor
Your party line in terms of policy matters
Creates you as an unimpressive figure
To take help from like-minded parties is alright
But to cash on unholy lines makes your position not right
You are guided by people who are causing your fall
Create sagging image and no one responds to call
It is clear from your move
In any way, it will not improve your position
The party may gown further
You shall be seen nowhere
The regional parties have their own agenda
They have only one plea
Remove the B.J.P from power
They want to use you as cover
They have no intention to accept you as leader
It will get harder and harder
You shall be compelled to comprise
And accept their man as a leader with promises"

1888,Emotion,PowerPoemsPowerPoembyAleisterCrowley,"The mighty sound of forests murmuring
In answer to the dread command;
The stars that shudder when their king
extends his hand,
His awful hand to bless, to curse; or moves
Toward the dimmest den
In the thick leaves, not known of loves
Or nymphs or men;
(Only the sylph's frail gossamer may wave
Their quiet frondage yet,
Only her dewy tears may lave
The violet;)
The mighty answer of the shaken sky
To his supreme behest; the call
Of Ibex that behold on high
Night's funeral,
And see the pale moon quiver and depart
Far beyond space, the sun ascend
And draw earth's globe unto his heart
To make an end;
The shriek of startled birds; the sobs that tear
With sudden terror the sharp sea
That slept, and wove its golden hair
Most mournfully;
The rending of the earth at his command
Who wields the wrath of heaven, and is dumb;
Hell starts up - and before his hand
Is overcome.
I heard these voices, and beheld afar
These dread works wrought at his behest:
And on his forehead, lo! a star,
And on his breast.
And on his feet I knew the sandals were
More beautiful than flame, and white,
And on the glory of his hair
The crown of night.
And I beheld his robe, and on its hem
Were writ unlawful words to say,
Broidered like lilies, with a gem
More clear than day.
And round him shone so wonderful a light
As when on Galilee
Jesus once walked, and clove the night,
And calmed the sea.
I scarce could see his features for the fire
That dwelt about his brow,
Yet, for the whiteness of my own desire,
I see him now;
Because my footsteps follow his, and tread
The awful bounds of heaven, and make
The very graves yield up their dead,
And high thrones shake;
Because my eyes still steadily behold
And dazzle not, nor shun the night,
The foam - born lamp of beaten gold
And secret might;
Because my forehead bears the sacred Name,
And my lips bear the brand
Of Him whose heaven is one flame,
Whose holy hand
Gathers this earth, who built the vaults of space,
Moulded the stars, and fixed the iron sea,
Because His love lights through my face
And all of me.
Because my hand may fasten on the sword
Of my heart falter not, and smite
Those lampless limits most abhorred
Of iron night,
And pass beyond their horror to attack
Fresh foemen, light and truth to bring
Through their untrodden fields of black,
A victor king.
I know all must be well, all must be free;
I know God as I know a friend;
I conquer, and most silently
Await the end."
1889,Emotion,PowerPoemsSpiderManWithGreatPowerComesGreatResponsibilityPoembyDenisMartindale,"Each man on Earth who strives for good
And seeks to bless the neighbourhood
Should ask himself what gifts he owns
To fight the evil crime condones!
Yet what of you who walks, runs, flies,
With spinning webs to cross the skies,
With strength and even prophecy?
Show great responsibility!
Split-second moves can save a life,
Thus bring peace to what was strife,
Defeating death before it laughs
And thus preventing epitaphs...
Inaction leads to utter loss -
A headstone and a tragic cross!
To overcome such infamy
Show great responsibility!
When greatness comes, it turns the mind -
Perhaps to benefit Mankind...
Perhaps to compensate your pains
Yet conscience blesses and restrains.
Therefore it's best to hear the call
Though it may drive you up the wall!
Don't think it's random destiny!
Show great responsibility!
So Peter Parker persevere -
Despite your doubt, despite your fear...
Despite your hate, despite your love...
Despite your thoughts, just rise above...
Tenacity is needed now -
Not posing for some gracious bow...
Superhero, do all you can
To honour the name of Spider-Man!"

With love
And it's passionless limbs
That drape over my bed
In a lethargic state of impotence
While wearing the same red heart
My soul picked up
Hitchhiking off highway
Now here we are
Alone in togetherness
Trying to build dreams
With two by fours
And glue
But even a home
Won't tie us together
When our hearts
Live alone
Poetic vows clinched
Into nothingness
Like all words do
Eventually
And we allowed
Our bodies
To become another pair
Of hollow shadows
That make love
To a wall
Instead of each other
And we wonder why
The roses are dying"

Make the hours last forever

Nothing can divide us
We have hope to guide us
That aura that surrounds us
Gives a glow that astounds us
All the colors of the rainbow shining through
Bringing paradise closer for me and you
Our love is elevated to the highest star
And getting there doesn’t seem very far
You came into my life like a flower
Full of color every waking hour
You came into my dreams like a butterfly
With kisses soft and sweet as pie
I get a fever of high alarms
When I wake up in your arms

Let’s dance the night away forever
Make happiness our new endeavor

There will be times for resting and healing our wounds
And time for working to just make it through,
We will ache and face sorrows,
As well as celebrate triumphs,
Some nights will be dark with nothing to guide us,
Others bright, as the moon will shine on us,
Days that are frigid that chill our deep bones,
Followed by afternoon breezes that warm our souls,
We will take turns, One can lead and one can follow
filling the other when hopes seem so hollow.
Mount Everest is a beast but well worth the climb
as life is a tower, we must follow time.
Today may not be the same as tomorrow,
it may bring us hope or it may bring us sorrow.
But one thing I know that I can assure you,
I promise you this, I never will leave you,
I may fall behind, or get far ahead,
But I will always wait, or catch up instead.
We are partners traveling together.
Even if we get lost we will still be in good company..."
1901,Emotion,TogetherPoemsCanWeTogetherChaseRainbowsOnceDonePoembyLawrenceSPertillar,"What we use to do.
And what we now can find no time,
Together.
Chasing rainbows once done!
Neglecting the Sunrays...
To prefer sitting under clouds,
Expecting rain and thunder to come!
Did we welcome that?
And when did it begin?
I wish what we use to do,
Could return back to us again!
But that would mean,
We would have to forgive and forget!
And revive the love,
That swept us off our feet.
And remove the dirt...
Kept swept under the rug!
Can we together,
Chase rainbows once done?
Or are we here...
To victimize each other's dreams?"
1902,Emotion,TogetherPoemsTogetherPoembyKellyVinal,"When I see the world, for you
When you became the world to me
A rainbow arched beyond the storms
To green pastures of destiny
Where our paths converge
As if God Himself determined
That this was the time
That we had walked enough alone
On those sad and winding roads
When I see the world, for you
By you, this is now a beautiful place
In the sun that parts the darkened clouds
In the presence of His grace
Your hand in my hand, together
We face the uncharted horizon
Of hope, of promise, of love
That God's gift of time is ours to share
As we walk by the calm and shimmering sea
Down the glorious road now set before us
Onward to eternity"
1903,Emotion,TogetherPoemsWorkTogetherPoembyJoJoBean,"Work Together*
Every creature on earth has feelings no matter the age
And the 'Go Getters' want to set their own stage
They forget how they got to be so smart
For they were taught by the older one's heart
We learn from our elders on what we should do
and we should all work together to see all things through

1904,Emotion,TogetherPoemsTogetherHandInHandPoembyMichaelPJohnson,"“Be quick and give your chocolate kid
Or else you’ll feel my toe
Let’s stay off school and spend your quid
Don’t let your mother know
Well that was you! Remember how
You always played the fool?
But here you are a preacher now
From all us kids at school
So rough you were, you’d always fight
You used to pull my hair
You scratched my face. You’d kick and bite
My clothes; you’d often tear”
“Yes that was true, I’m sad to say
Though no one ever knew
When first I saw you kneel and pray
‘Twas I who envied you
I knew you always thought me rough
In truth! I’d just pretend
Outside I only acted tough
Because I had no friend
But praise the Lord, you’re preaching too!
Yet when I heard you phone
I gave no thought, that that was you!
Yet all to God was known”
“Yes looking back, it now seems odd
From you; I’d run a mile
But now we’re brothers serving God
And all we do is smile”
“I’m also pleased, I won’t pretend
Yet now; I understand
So come! Let’s praise God’s name dear friend
Together! Hand in hand….."
1905,Emotion,TogetherPoemsPleasePutMeBackTogetherPoembyLindaWinchell,"Someone put me back together!
I seem to be falling all apart!
It started when my lover went away
leaving a hole in my chest
where once there had beat a heart.
I'm feeling like the Straw man
In the movie, the Wizard of Oz!
Where all of the straw mans straw parts
all fell off, his legs, his arms, his schnoz!
My head can't seem to stay up
my eyes are watering all the time!
My legs are weak, my smile is gone
I'm falling apart and my parts seem out of line!
Please someone put me back together!
so that I might live and love again!
Is there anyone out there who can help me?
Who might know how, to put me back together again."
1906,Emotion,TogetherPoemsTogetherAgainPoembyAnthonyTaimangloTaitano,"This road is always an easy road at the beginning,
but time has a funny way of turning things around. The
passion and the love you have for life, you still have,
but I just never saw it, till it was too late. Time has a strange way of healing. The years have now
passed and for some reason, destiny has brought us back
together. Why! There is a reason for this, I don't know
why but, I wouldn't question it. It's now your turn for happiness and for receiving
that gift of peace and love, for your years of giving.
My love, the light now shines through my window. I see
the light shining, I can see the lake of peace, which will
now be calm and serene for us both. For till time finally stands still, I will be here for
you and never to abandon you, as long as we are together. So till the end of time, I will be yours."
1907,Emotion,TogetherPoemsWeTwoBoysTogetherClingingPoembyWaltWhitman,"WE two boys together clinging,
One the other never leaving,
Up and down the roads going--North and South excursions making,
Power enjoying--elbows stretching--fingers clutching,
Arm'd and fearless--eating, drinking, sleeping, loving,
No law less than ourselves owning--sailing, soldiering, thieving,
threatening,
Misers, menials, priests alarming--air breathing, water drinking, on
the turf or the sea-beach dancing,
Cities wrenching, ease scorning, statutes mocking, feebleness
chasing,
Fulfilling our foray."
1908,Emotion,TogetherPoemsLetUsSingTogetherLovePoembyprasannakumari,"Let us sing together, Love
I want you to drown in my songs, Love
And be lost in me...
But how do I sing...
My flute is only a hollow pipe
My harp is with broken strings
My numb fingers on my drum
Nor have I got a nightingale’s throat
Come and be with me, my Love
Let’s sing together...
from those unheard melodies
To fill our nights....
with the music of the stars
and the humming of the moonlight
To fill our days...
with the song of the breeze flirting with the flowers
and the murmur of the wind seducing the leaves to dance
Are you not listening, my Love
I am singing...
from the music of  raindrops falling on the grass
from the soft sound of buds blossoming into flowers
from the murmur of darkness embracing our love
and the soft sound of light enveloping us
And from the last dance of the falling leaves.....
A fleeting smile on your lips...?
Heard my songs, Love...?
Are you not intoxicated...
By the sweet and enchanting music of our love"
1909,Emotion,TogetherPoemsTheMoonVersusUsEverSleepingTogetherAgainPoembyRichardBrautigan,"I sit here, an arch-villain of romance,
thinking about you. Gee, I'm sorry
I made you unhappy, but there was nothing
I could do about it because I have to be free.
Perhaps everything would have been different
if you had stayed at the table or asked me
to go out with you to look at the moon,
instead of getting up and leaving me alone with
her."
1910,Emotion,TogetherPoemsSeperatelyTogetherPoembyBiancaWalker,"We arrived at our home that night separately in the same car.
He needed to speak.
I needed silence.
He needed time together.
I needed time alone.
He needed to prove a point.
I had nothing to prove.
He said he was leaving.
I said leave the key on the table.
He asked did I even care?
I just stared…
He glared…
He wanted to fight.
I had no fury.
I have nothing left…
We've been through this before.
Another battle in an on going war.
It's time to put down our bags,
And wave the flag.
Love did not win.
She may live deep within, but's it's too long of a journey to the surface.
He says I'm moody
And after all this time  he'scompletely blind
How? ? ? ? after 6 years can he not understand me?
We wasted so much time,
But still produced beautiful memories.
We don't have to ask what happened to us.
It happened...and now we will deal with it.
We'll heal.
Grieve.
Cuss.
Spit.
& blame.
Be ashamed, and have to explain,
to family and friends who will takes sides.
Your family will blame me because they can't see,
The side of you that lives with me, and vise versa...
It could've been something beautiful
I gave plentifully
But even completely, at times is not enough
We've tested the weather
Yet still live separately together
It's time to live completely alone.

Let us run away from this society

Let us get rid of this anxiety
and make a lovely story.
Nobody would keep you away from me

United we stand to fight all odds,
United we cheer our victories out loud.

We move forward towards our goal,

If ever man were lov'd by wife, then thee.
If ever wife was happy in a man,
Compare with me, ye women, if you can.
I prize thy love more than whole Mines of gold
Or all the riches that the East doth hold.
My love is such that Rivers cannot quench,
Nor ought but love from thee give recompetence.
Thy love is such I can no way repay.
The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray.
Then while we live, in love let's so persever
That when we live no more, we may live ever."
1915,Emotion,TogetherPoemsWhenWeWereHereTogetherPoembyKennethPatchen,"when we were here together in a place we did not know, nor one
another.
A bit of grass held between the teeth for a moment, bright hair on the
wind.
What we were we did not know, nor even the grass or the flame of
hair turning to ash on the wind.
But they lied about that. From the beginning they lied. To the child,
telling him that there was somewhere anger against him, and a
hatred against him, and the only reason for his being in the
world.
But never did they tell him that the only evil and danger was in
themselves; that they alone were the prisoners and the betrayers;
that they - they alone - were responsible for what was being done
in the world.
And they told the child to starve and to kill the child that was within
him; for only by doing this could he become a useful and adjusted
member of the community which they had prepared for him.
And this time, alas, they did not lie.
And with the death of the child was born a thing that had neither
the character of a man nor the character of a child, but was a
horrible and monstrous parody of the two; and it is in this world
now that the flesh of man’s spirit lies twisted and despoiled under
the indifferent stars.
When we were here together in a place we did not know, nor one
another.
O green the bit of warm grass between our teeth. O beautiful the hair
of our mortal goddess on the indifferent wind."

1917,Emotion,TogetherPoemsRememberingTogetherPoembyJosephTRenaldi,"The old, oak tree stands firm,
So full of historical memories
That only can be expressed fully
By the documented words in diaries.
Beside a tarnished statue it stands,
Its stiff old branches pointed upward
Toward the puffy, white clouds in the sky,
And some of its limbs hung downward
Above the statue's bowing head
As though they would protect
It from the weather elements,
And the caretaker's gross neglect.
Many years of tribulation have gone by,
But the tarnished statue and the old, oak tree
Remember together the vast suffering
Of the bloody conflict that used to be."

we forget about the world
and we go into paradise
in a world of our own.
When we are together united
as one we speak no words
For our bodies say it all.
We take our time to explore
the wonders and rejoice the
moments when our bodies have
surrendered.
We laugh and we talk until
Our bodies refuel with our
passionate kisses and our
love so true, we continue
to explore the wonders in
a paradise of our own, a
place we call home, when we
are together."
1921,Emotion,TogetherPoemsTogetherWeReAlonePoembyPaulMoosberg,"There is no place or grace, for all the human race
The race of will, to race and kill
As anger fills and kills the thrill
That we hold near and dear, we cherished children fear
The wraith of God, the wraith of man
The wraith of future shines the plan
That we can maul it all, from front to back we saw
The answer here, the answer there
And never thought to question where
Did anger’s state of hate, combined collaborate
That one is right, and powering
Then one will fight for might to sing
The battle long of song, dividing right from wrong
The death of you, the death of me
The death of us for all to see
No one can own this bone, together we’re alone"

Nor is this about you...
Then what on Earth are we attracted to?
If I like what I see...
And you say the same of me,
Then what is it together
Are we really seeking?
You say I don't listen,
To your scattered conversations.
I want to understand...
But you take off with new sensations.
And I'm to comprehend,
Which one ends before another begins?
If it isn't about me
Nor is this about you...
Then what on Earth are we attracted to?
This hasn't been mentioned...
But I think you are seeking attention.
And I wouldn't mind,
To receive that from you sometimes!
If I like what I see...
And you say the same of me,
Then what is it together
Are we wishing the other to be?"
1923,Emotion,TogetherPoemsHereThePoetsSingTogetherPoembyBillGrace,"The net has united what civil commerce could not join -
Frost laboring twenty years for a two bill tip
No wonder there was a darkness to his soul,
For isolation was his true reward and punishment.
We who have come after have no excuse
For we too must write but have the grace
Of knowing of each others words and place
And in appreciation cheering on
The terrible isolation broken by the power of distant love.
How would Emily if she were with us now
Ever withstand the corruption of such adulation by her peers?
A safety - it seems - that only death or the greatest faith can guarantee."

1925,Emotion,TogetherPoemsRidingTogetherPoembyWilliamMorris,"For many, many days together
The wind blew steady from the East;
For many days hot grew the weather,
About the time of our Lady's Feast.
For many days we rode together,
Yet met we neither friend nor foe;
Hotter and clearer grew the weather,
Steadily did the East wind blow.
We saw the trees in the hot, bright weather,
Clear-cut, with shadows very black,
As freely we rode on together
With helms unlaced and bridles slack.
And often, as we rode together,
We, looking down the green-bank'd stream,
Saw flowers in the sunny weather,
And saw the bubble-making bream.
And in the night lay down together,
And hung above our heads the rood,
Or watch'd night-long in the dewy weather,
The while the moon did watch the wood.
Our spears stood bright and thick together,
Straight out the banners stream'd behind,
As we gallop'd on in the sunny weather,
With faces turn'd towards the wind.
Down sank our threescore spears together,
As thick we saw the pagans ride;
His eager face in the clear fresh weather,
Shone out that last time by my side.
Up the sweep of the bridge we dash'd together,
It rock'd to the crash of the meeting spears,
Down rain'd the buds of the dear spring weather,
The elm-tree flowers fell like tears.
There, as we roll'd and writhed together,
I threw my arms above my head,
For close by my side, in the lovely weather,
I saw him reel and fall back dead.
I and the slayer met together,
He waited the death-stroke there in his place,
With thoughts of death, in the lovely weather,
Gapingly mazed at my madden'd face.
Madly I fought as we fought together;
In vain: the little Christian band
The pagans drown'd, as in stormy weather
The river drowns low-lying land.
They bound my blood-stain'd hands together,
They bound his corpse to nod by my side:
Then on we rode, in the bright March weather,
With clash of cymbals did we ride.
We ride no more, no more together;
My prison-bars are thick and strong,
I take no heed of any weather,
The sweet Saints grant I live not long."

1928,Emotion,TogetherPoemsTogetherPoembyDanBrown,"We rise together, up into the sky,
We join together, watch the world pass by.
We are together, together as a cloud,
Standing out to each other in the worldly crowd.
We fall together, as hard, heavy rain,
On hitting the ground we both experience the hard, heavy pain.
We ride the wind together, with Understanding at the reigns,
Despite the upset, a bond remains.
You are my wind, but together we fly,
We’re very apart, but together we cry.
You will always be that wind, pushing me high,
I will always be that heartache making you cry.
Together we hurt, and that feeling reigns,
Each heart being eaten by the love it contains.
We’ll fall to the ground together, once again as rain,
For someone I have found, to share my pain.
We’ll come together once more, as a tear-soaked cloud,
Emerge to each other from beneath our shroud.
We will rise again together, on the day we die.
We’ll hold hands together, on the path to the sky."

Together we'll lie
Held tightly in your arms

Together at last
How did I ever go on without you in my past
Each moment
Sweet kiss
I simply can't resist
Everytime you touch me
I feel comeplete
When our eyes meet
My hand is yours

Walking along these shores
We're perfect for each other

We're just two people
Whose lives we can share"

But apart!
Together in body,

Out of the love
Which we had
At the start.
Only the children
Hold us together,
And the lives
We live each day.
But when you lie beside me,
In our cold bed at night,
We just lie there, together, apart,
And nothing is right.
I long for what we had,
When all that we did,
We did together,
But your heart left me,
And we only remain
Together, Apart.

Transient in nature but stolid in form

Moorings are broken, stability torn
From deep in a hole these changes accelerate
Blending and blurring the pieces within
No safe haven for me to extrapolate
No end in sight, nowhere to begin

Consciousness shared is one never lost
Striping me of my valued humanity
Solace in union at very high cost"

This fact is nothing new
Each day she sees she’s growing less
But what on earth’s to do?
Allow my children air their views
Let wisdom, take command –1Ti.4: 11
Take care that no one should confuse –Pr.18: 2
Who fail to understand
A child’s soon bored, when nought’s to do
They cry, when hurt or spurned –2Ti.2: 24
But quick to see when something’s new
And show it, they’ve learned
To hinder them, would be absurd –Mt.19: 14
Could cause a deep divide
Could make them think, the truth they’ve heard
Is better off to hide
What are the needs of every child?
How can their souls; be saved?
What hinders them, from running wild?
What makes them well behaved?
The King of kings can see it well
So down in black on white –1Co.14: 26
I wrote that ALL the saved should tell
The gospel of His Light –Mt.28: 18-20
The truth’s not left to one alone –Ex.18: 17-26
Although ordained with oil
Yet ALL may help the plough to hone –Pr.27: 17

Nor quench my Spirit’s flow –1Ti.5: 19

In unity; can grow…"

Or the soft breeze at dusk
Nor the dizzying midnight moon

Always whispering love
Into your ear,
Wanting you to hear
The rhythm of my heartbeats,
Never doubt what you mean to me,
I saw you growing up,
Adorable and dream-like and laughing
With your older sister,
And I cannot resist saying
Time has been your ally,
Your beautiful, feminine mystique
Only increases with intensity,
I know we’ll be together again
On café streets
Reciting sacred poetry
As small birds serenade us
On an avenue of trees."

Let us go far away where the world is silent
Hold my heart close to your heart with love
Let us feel the beauty of love in our soul
When those stars make romantic nights
Let our hearts melt down with our deep emotions
When those nights bring moonlight on our body
Let us cover and roll with our 'love blanket'
When those trees dance with evening breeze
Let us dance with our world of dreams
When those ocean waves rolling high with sound
Let our heat waves touch our body with our feelings
When our arms around each others and makes us comfort
Let us give ourselves to each others for the endless love
Till those gates of the heaven open for us
Let you and me live in this world together forever

1937,Emotion,TogetherPoemsTogetherForeverAgainPoembyPamelaORucker,"That exciting moment was finally here, we didn't have to wait any more
It's a girl I heard the doctor say, the joy in my heart cannot be described
We held each other close as we cried with joy till we realized it was quiet
As we turned to look at the doctors they were looking at us in a sad way
I'm sorry to tell you this but your daughter has a few problems in her body
She probably won't live to be but a few days old if she makes it that long
I'm so sorry, but you can hold her for as long as you would like to for now
They said she didn't have any eyes and she would never be able to see
She didn't have a brain so her body wouldn't be able to function properly
These were only a few of the problems that my daughter was born with
We only had the joy of having her in our life for about one month
Then the Lord took her home so that he could make her whole
I can't wait until the day when I see the miracles that were performed
And I'll feel that joy all over again just like the day that she was born
But this time we'll be together forever in eternity never to face any tears"
1938,Emotion,TogetherPoemsTheLastRideTogetherPoembyRobertBrowning,"I.
I said---Then, dearest, since 'tis so,
Since now at length my fate I know,
Since nothing all my love avails,
Since all, my life seemed meant for, fails,
Since this was written and needs must be---
My whole heart rises up to bless
Your name in pride and thankfulness!
Take back the hope you gave,---I claim
---Only a memory of the same,
---And this beside, if you will not blame,
Your leave for one more last ride with me.
II.
My mistress bent that brow of hers;
Those deep dark eyes where pride demurs
When pity would be softening through,
Fixed me, a breathing-while or two,
With life or death in the balance: right!
The blood replenished me again;
My last thought was at least not vain:
I and my mistress, side by side
Shall be together, breathe and ride,
So, one day more am I deified.
Who knows but the world may end tonight?

Hush! if you saw some western cloud
All billowy-bosomed, over-bowed
By many benedictions---sun's
And moon's and evening-star's at once---
And so, you, looking and loving best,
Conscious grew, your passion drew
Cloud, sunset, moonrise, star-shine too,
Down on you, near and yet more near,
Till flesh must fade for heaven was here!---
Thus leant she and lingered---joy and fear!
Thus lay she a moment on my breast.
IV.
Then we began to ride. My soul
Smoothed itself out, a long-cramped scroll
Freshening and fluttering in the wind.
Past hopes already lay behind.
What need to strive with a life awry?
Had I said that, had I done this,
So might I gain, so might I miss.
Might she have loved me? just as well
She might have hated, who can tell!
Where had I been now if the worst befell?
And here we are riding, she and I.
V.
Fail I alone, in words and deeds?
Why, all men strive and who succeeds?
We rode; it seemed my spirit flew,
Saw other regions, cities new,
As the world rushed by on either side.
I thought,---All labour, yet no less
Bear up beneath their unsuccess.
Look at the end of work, contrast
The petty done, the undone vast,
This present of theirs with the hopeful past!
I hoped she would love me; here we ride.
VI.
What hand and brain went ever paired?
What heart alike conceived and dared?
What act proved all its thought had been?
What will but felt the fleshly screen?
We ride and I see her bosom heave.
There's many a crown for who can reach,
Ten lines, a statesman's life in each!
The flag stuck on a heap of bones,
A soldier's doing! what atones?
They scratch his name on the Abbey-stones.
My riding is better, by their leave.
VII.
What does it all mean, poet? Well,
Your brains beat into rhythm, you tell
What we felt only; you expressed
You hold things beautiful the best,
And pace them in rhyme so, side by side.
'Tis something, nay 'tis much: but then,
Have you yourself what's best for men?
Are you---poor, sick, old ere your time---
Nearer one whit your own sublime
Than we who never have turned a rhyme?
Sing, riding's a joy! For me, I ride.
VIII.
And you, great sculptor---so, you gave
A score of years to Art, her slave,
And that's your Venus, whence we turn
To yonder girl that fords the burn!
You acquiesce, and shall I repine?
What, man of music, you grown grey
With notes and nothing else to say,
Is this your sole praise from a friend,
``Greatly his opera's strains intend,
``Put in music we know how fashions end!''
I gave my youth; but we ride, in fine.
IX.
Who knows what's fit for us? Had fate
Proposed bliss here should sublimate
My being---had I signed the bond---
Still one must lead some life beyond,
Have a bliss to die with, dim-descried.
This foot once planted on the goal,
This glory-garland round my soul,
Could I descry such? Try and test!
I sink back shuddering from the quest.
Earth being so good, would heaven seem best?
Now, heaven and she are beyond this ride.
X.
And yet---she has not spoke so long!
What if heaven be that, fair and strong
At life's best, with our eyes upturned
Whither life's flower is first discerned,
We, fixed so, ever should so abide?
What if we still ride on, we two
With life for ever old yet new,
Changed not in kind but in degree,
The instant made eternity,---
And heaven just prove that I and she
Ride, ride together, for ever ride?"
1939,Emotion,TogetherPoemsCantHoldMyselfTogetherPoembyReshmaRamesh,"Can u hear the squeals of laughter,
the laugh i laughed when i was a little girl?
The princess i wanted to grow into
The prince i would never find.
I never learn my lessons,
I gave up looking for reasons,
rushing by me are all the seasons,
cant hold myself together,
breaking into a million pieces.
I always wanted the sun to shine
I never wanted to cross the line
but baby u left me without the sun
and tied my laces so that I could not run.
I laugh when my heart cries
the sadness I feel it denies
the truth is like a dream
that would make anyone scream
In all this nightmare is a life
which I live now and then
I dream of love and happiness
tears of joy running down my eyes
I dream of kites flying  high in the sky
which I cant reach no matter how hard i try
iam a little girl scared of the monsters under my bed
somehow they crawled up and got into my head
'god you are so beautiful' they say
I am gonna love you all the way
but darling cant you see
you love yourself more than me
I bleed where you have cut me
I hurt where you have hit me
you wipe your hands and look surprised
when I lay broken and bleeding by your side
Wish I could run and hide
reach a day where there would be no tomorrow
believe me when i say
please please please don't go away
Wish I could make more sense
build up more in my defense
wish I could turn off this living
that would end this heart's grieving
And when Iam gone the world will move on
at my grave the flowers will dry
the earth my mother and water my father
I am safe and my soul heals in the tomb."
1940,Emotion,TogetherPoemsTogetherWithThoseApprovingItPoembyLawrenceSPertillar,"If you are not sure what you are looking for...
What makes you think you are going to find it,
Stumbling through life?
If you can not identify what it is that makes you tick...
Why get on someone else's nerves,
Putting up with something you haven't dealt with?
There are many who blame others for what is not right,
In a world uptight!
Everyone is looking for solutions to 'quick fix'!
But few are willing to sit down to admit...
Pulling tricks out of a hat to create magic,
May be great for amusements...
To 'shock and awe' those who sit!
But this doesn't cure a search for purpose,
Or heal those in disturbing conflicts!
Because they find in their minds this is okay....
And gather together with those approving it!"
1941,Emotion,TogetherPoemsFamilyComesTogetherPoembyGlaedrthepoet,"Family comes together
For always and forever
In sickness and in health
In poverty or in wealth
Family comes together
For always and forever
Without any reason
Anytime or any season
Family comes together
For always and forever
In death or in life
In happiness or in strife
Family comes together
For always and forever
In anger or in kindness
Whether all seeing or in blindness
Family comes together
For always and forever
Whether for work or for play
They somehow find a way
For family to come together
Because families are forever"
1942,Emotion,TogetherPoemsFiftyYearsTogetherPoembyMarilynLott,"It was over fifty years ago
They met and something clicked
After all the folks they had met before
They found the perfect person to pick
Larry and Lois had a purpose
They knew the direction they’d go
Nothing would stand in their way
Because they loved each other so
So marriage was inevitable
In time the couple had three boys
Working together to raise their family
Patience was always employed
They took their vows seriously
Trudging down life’s worn pathway
Keeping that strong firm direction
Always meeting one another half way
Of course there were a few hills
And at times some stormy weather
But the main thing that was important
Was they climbed those hills together
And now those fifty years are past
And their happiness isn’t just a rumor
Their beautiful smiles are evidence
Along with a great sense of humor!"
1943,Emotion,TogetherPoemsAliveTogetherPoembyLiselMueller,"Speaking of marvels, I am alive
together with you, when I might have been
alive with anyone under the sun,
when I might have been Abelard's woman
or the whore of a Renaissance pope
or a peasant wife with not enough food
and not enough love, with my children
dead of the plague. I might have slept
in an alcove next to the man
with the golden nose, who poked it
into the business of stars,
or sewn a starry flag
for a general with wooden teeth.
I might have been the exemplary Pocahontas
or a woman without a name
weeping in Master's bed
for my husband, exchanged for a mule,
my daughter, lost in a drunken bet.
I might have been stretched on a totem pole
to appease a vindictive god
or left, a useless girl-child,
to die on a cliff. I like to think
I might have been Mary Shelley
in love with a wrong-headed angel,
or Mary's friend. I might have been you.
This poem is endless, the odds against us are endless,
our chances of being alive together
statistically nonexistent;
still we have made it, alive in a time
when rationalists in square hats
and hatless Jehovah's Witnesses
agree it is almost over,
alive with our lively children
who-but for endless ifs-
might have missed out on being alive
together with marvels and follies
and longings and lies and wishes
and error and humor and mercy
and journeys and voices and faces
and colors and summers and mornings
and knowledge and tears and chance."
1944,Emotion,TogetherPoemsEatingTogetherPoembyLiYoungLee,"In the steamer is the trout
seasoned with slivers of ginger,
two sprigs of green onion, and sesame oil.
We shall eat it with rice for lunch,
brothers, sister, my mother who will
taste the sweetest meat of the head,
holding it between her fingers
deftly, the way my father did
weeks ago. Then he lay down
to sleep like a snow-covered road
winding through pines older than him,
without any travelers, and lonely for no one."
1945,Emotion,TogetherPoemsWereIInHeavenWeDBeAbleToDanceTogetherPoembykiteremedy,"I plunk at a beach,
silence herein,
I am, bit by bit,
shredded by winds
I pause all alone,
nowhere to go,
as if I were lost,
in a crossroad
Fall on my knees,
and it is you I see
dancing gracefully
in a place I can't be
Flash before me,
our memories,
I close my eyes
and it's I perceive,
But, piece by piece,
those memories,
fading away,
leaving me at a bay
Silence hurts me,
tears me apiece
but inside my heart,
there goes a story
won't ever last,
though my body
is torn apiece
by winds before me....
'All of our trance,
won't ever end
Until we can dance,
together again'"
1946,Emotion,TogetherPoemsTogetherPoembyHeatherWilliams,"together through thick and thin
together till the end
nothing can come between
im sure you know what i mean
from the first time you said hi
i felt my heart begin to fly
and the fact that your around
i find it hard just to frown
as your with me for a while
all i can give is a smile
as you leave to go home
i began to feel all alone
but i know it's not for long
though to me it's a sad sad song
together we'll be together we'll stay
that is all i want you to say"
1947,Emotion,TogetherPoemsStayingTogetherPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"It was as if my trusted hand
had sought and reached autonomy
and snapped that old familial band
then wandered off, just to be free.
Why, so  I asked, the need to leave
the body took good care of it
it was a wintry, snowy eve
I'd used it then, with charme and wit
when from the darkness of the woods
from shades of fiction's paradise
a maiden stepped -she had the goods!
I saw her body and her eyes.
My hand, now separate from me,
its motherboard and full alert
advanced uphill from bony knee
as if in search of a big hurt.
A healing hand it had become,
I watched as fingers did the walk
as dew reflected, I was numb
and could not breathe and barely talk
the show was carnal in extreme.
Two teary eyes were in a blur
and dreaming of the sweetest cream,
we could not take our eyes off her.
A sudden stirring caught my mind
another part was game to go
it stretched and grew, so that a blind
and dead man could not miss the show.
Though I had never known the fact
that parts could see without two eyes
it was what bones and muscles lacked
what kept them loyal, also wise.
This time was different, pheromones
were heard to come from deep inside
such lovely, sweet and magic tones
they left the entrance open wide.
That day I could have lost those two
if sanity had been away
but from experience I knew
that one must come to really play.
So, with a cry of 'I agree',
I joined the fun where rebels played
and re-united but still free
we were together, and we stayed."

1949,Emotion,TogetherPoemsAChristmasTogetherPoembyBeggarBoy,"We need not snow,
Or electrical glow.
It's not a matter of weather,
Because we're together.
We need not a 'magic',
Love's not in a gadget.
There's only one matter:
It's that we're together.
Need we the songs,
Or the movies that come on?
We've the best of what's better,
When we're together.
There's a look on our faces
That surely displaces
All the boxes and cases,
and the ribbon and laces.
It's the beauty of Together.
There's something about our time
That bears the fruit of the vine,
Making a sweeter wine.
The fingerprints of the Divine,
On the truth of Together.
When we've all gathered round,
And harken to the sound,
Of God's presence all around,
The perfect setting being found...
We're Together."

Alone together in the darkness
May your touch always be sweet..."
1951,Emotion,TogetherPoemsSleepingTogetherPoembyKatherineMansfield,"Sleeping together... how tired you were...
How warm our room... how the firelight spread
On walls and ceiling and great white bed!
We spoke in whispers as children do,
And now it was I--and then it was you
Slept a moment, to wake--""My dear,
I'm not at all sleepy,"" one of us said....
Was it a thousand years ago?
I woke in your arms--you were sound asleep--
And heard the pattering sound of sheep.
Softly I slipped to the floor and crept
To the curtained window, then, while you slept,
I watched the sheep pass by in the snow.
O flock of thoughts with their shepherd Fear
Shivering, desolate, out in the cold,
That entered into my heart to fold!
A thousand years... was it yesterday
When we two children of far away,
Clinging close in the darkness, lay
Sleeping together?... How tired you were...."

1954,Emotion,TogetherPoemsLetsPrayTogetherPoembyMichaelPJohnson,"Come join me now in prayer my friend
Unite our souls in praise
Together let our knees now bend
To The Ancient Of Days
In spirit let us be as one
Let’s bow before God’s throne
Let’s thank Him for the victory won
Upon The Tree alone
In gratitude let’s raise our voice
Let’s celebrate and sing
Let love within our hearts rejoice
That Christ is truly King
Salvation’s come in truth my friend
God’s Spirit dwells inside
Now life for us will never end
Beyond the great divide
Let’s pray our friends and families see
Our selfish world may hear
Let’s pray The Truth their souls will free
And learn their God to fear
Thank God that death has lost its sting
The devil’s seen defeat
That soon as if on eagle’s wing
We’ll join His royal elite
We’ll fight the fight as none before
In armour shining bright
With victory through our Father’s door
We’ll sit arrayed in light
Let’s praise The Lord for all He’s done
Let’s thank The Holy Dove
Let’s lift up high God’s Lamb & Son
And thank Him for His love"
1955,Emotion,TogetherPoemsLetsReasonTogetherPoembyMichaelPJohnson,"God’s bidding all before His throne
In spite of spot and flaw
Whilst man is oft a stumbling stone
Sharing burdens galore
We talk with marbles stuffed in cheek
We stand aloof and cold
Preaching, teaching the lost and weak
What ought or not be told
We raise our voice with pious phrase
Uttering words divine
Yet see God’s sheep these latter days
Refuse our bread and wine
“You can’t do this, that’s not allowed
You can’t wear this or that”
Whilst Heaven calls both man and crowd
With welcome on the mat
We disregard God’s mighty word
We disregard His laws
We disregard the facts we’ve heard
Behind religious doors
We prophecy in aisle and pew
In red and gold we pray
Telling God’s children what to do
With every known cliché
The church should speak as Christ would do
Like children on the street
Should walk The Walk that others too
May rise with joy complete
Welcoming all to come inside
Though saint or common whore
Let Jesus be our Lord and guide
Toward our Father’s Door"
1956,Emotion,TogetherPoemsAnAwkwardComingTogetherPoembyDanBrown,"I see him as I walk in.
I see him looking at me.
He sees me looking at him, too.
He looks away instantly, and so do I.
Out the corner of my eye, I see him glancing at me.
He sees me looking again, and turns away, as do I.
I think we’re both embarrassed.
I noticed he was pretty cute, though.
I stand with my back to him, composing myself.
I turn round, and he’s stood ahead of me.
Looking at me,
like I’m looking at him.
I forget myself, and just lose myself in his big, blue eyes.
Big, blue eyes that hold me captivated,
and guide me through the gateway to his soul.
They reflect every emotion I knew existed.
Hurt, hatred, love and compassion.
Happiness, loneliness, pain and depression.
As a glimmer of an attraction shines,
I find myself smiling. He smiles with me.
Wow, that’s a killer smile.
I stand in front of him, openly staring,
and feeding the fire rumbling in me
with his gorgeous features.
My heart was racing,
but it couldn’t keep up with my thoughts.
Ideas and questions rushed haphazardly through my head
How do I tell him I like him?
Will he believe me?
I took one deep breath,
and spoke.
“Dan, pull yourself together, you look amazing, and there is nothing to be shy and self-conscious about. Get out there and knock ‘em dead! ”"

And Jill will bring some sausages and John a slab of beer
And David will bring lamb chops and Jean a kilo of sirloin steaks or two
And we will have a sing song around the barbecue.
And Jan will bring some dessert for to have with our tea
And Ian will bring his guitar for to lead in the revelry
And Carol she will bring her voice she has the gift of song
And we'll all join in the chorus and with her sing along.
We'll have a get together come rain or hail or shine
And around the smoky barby we'll sing For Auld Lang Syne
The grub and grog won't cost us that much and the entertainment's free
And Joe will make us all laugh with his jocularity.
We'll have a get together and Jenny will be there
And the beautiful Belinda with blue eyes and golden hair
And foxy haired Jimmy Rucker one quite fond of his beer
A twenty year old who enjoys the party atmosphere.
And Fiveways Dave a happy sort now showing his years in gray
Will join our get together for to welcome New Year's Day
And we'll eat drink and make merry around the barbecue
And sing farewell to the old and welcome in the new."
1958,Emotion,TogetherPoemsBeautifulDaysTogetherPoembyWinnieAngel,"Beautiful are the days when we used to be together,
beautiful will be the days again when we will be together,
Every moment, every day which we spent together,
Will be always there as beautiful memories.
Time brings changes, time brings distance,
time is power, time is strength,
time decides where we will be,
Time decides when we will be together again.
Days since childhood,
We have always played, fought, cared  for each other.
Days in present we are still the same,
sharing every thought we have and every happiness and pain.
Still the strong bond of sisterhood,
tends to mean more than just sisters or friends.
Many still do find place in my heart,
But none can ever be replace in your place in my heart! ! !

1961,Emotion,TogetherPoemsForeverJoinedTogetherAtTheHipPoembyTedSheridan,"nine minutes and thirty seven seconds
was the time it took for her to fire up her temper and car
while deciding how she was going to end her life or his
the sex had been good for a while but not good enough
that he would keep his promised vows to her
she knew he was going to be with the other woman
she had smelled her all over him at dinner
cheap perfume....he was always a sucker
for lots of lipstick and cheap perfumes...
deep in the mayhem and turmoil of very female emotions
she lunged with a left turn and then hung a wide right
into a highly distracted intersection of cat and mouse
where her small vulnerable car was yonically impacted
by that of his brute Hummer's phallic killer instincts
nine minutes and thirty seven seconds
was the time it took for them to be forever.....joined at the hip"

my delightful, melodious girl;
let us sit in the shade
sipping pink lemonade
as awakening blossoms unfurl.
We can twitter a tune by The Beatles, my love,
if we lounge for a time in the park;
I will sing 'Love Me Do'
then grin widely as you
pipe 'A Day In The Life' on a lark.
If we harmonize well, a Fab-Fourian spell
might enrapture the city, my sweet -
then each cabbie and cop
in Manhattan will hop
to a hip, Beatlemanian-Beat.
Should the spirit of Lennon appear to us, dear,
with George Harrison close to his side,
I will beam as you cling
to my arm when they sing
a rendition of 'Ticket To Ride'.
When we venture at sunset
from Strawberry Fields
and meander down Central Park West,
I will nod when you say: “Other bands are okay -
but The Beatles were surely the best.”"

Those who did not choose to flaunt correctness.
Or exposed a weakened disposition.
Some have rode as passengers...
Seated with sights that ignited clearer perceptions.
Others have been treated to a scenic view.
Either way...
All will arrive at the same destination.
Not at the same time!
However,
Everyone will have opportunities...
To describe their journey.
And the picture observed will no longer be in pieces!
Once complete and put together to share!"

Her scent lingers on his clothes
Her lips want nothing more than a kiss
His hands want nothing else but her
With nothing to say is every word
They're meant to be forever entwined
No matter the scene no matter the world
T'was love at first sight no plan no time
The beauty inside is for eyes he holds
Behind his looks what her heart desires
Only had he ever lusted and dreamt
Until this day she's in his arms
Didn't want her for lust or her sight
He wanted her heart he knew t'was right
He questioned not once on how he felt
He knew t'was love and nothing else
So pure and so gentle he'd never pick fights
Unless t'was for his lover his wife
Met young and grew old together hand in hand
They found their love in a grain of sand
It came out of nothing though some may say
It came from the stars where the moon doth lay
It came from their life their love in their hearts
Apassion in soul a love in an art
Together and always
Soulmates forever

1966,Emotion,TogetherPoemsLastRideTogetherThePoembyRobertBrowning,"I.
I said---Then, dearest, since 'tis so,
Since now at length my fate I know,
Since nothing all my love avails,
Since all, my life seemed meant for, fails,
Since this was written and needs must be---
My whole heart rises up to bless
Your name in pride and thankfulness!
Take back the hope you gave,---I claim
---Only a memory of the same,
---And this beside, if you will not blame,
Your leave for one more last ride with me.
II.
My mistress bent that brow of hers;
Those deep dark eyes where pride demurs
When pity would be softening through,
Fixed me, a breathing-while or two,
With life or death in the balance: right!
The blood replenished me again;
My last thought was at least not vain:
I and my mistress, side by side
Shall be together, breathe and ride,
So, one day more am I deified.
Who knows but the world may end tonight?
III.
Hush! if you saw some western cloud
All billowy-bosomed, over-bowed
By many benedictions---sun's
And moon's and evening-star's at once---
And so, you, looking and loving best,
Conscious grew, your passion drew
Cloud, sunset, moonrise, star-shine too,
Down on you, near and yet more near,
Till flesh must fade for heaven was here!---
Thus leant she and lingered---joy and fear!
Thus lay she a moment on my breast.
IV.
Then we began to ride. My soul
Smoothed itself out, a long-cramped scroll
Freshening and fluttering in the wind.
Past hopes already lay behind.
What need to strive with a life awry?
Had I said that, had I done this,
So might I gain, so might I miss.
Might she have loved me? just as well
She might have hated, who can tell!
Where had I been now if the worst befell?
And here we are riding, she and I.
V.
Fail I alone, in words and deeds?
Why, all men strive and who succeeds?
We rode; it seemed my spirit flew,
Saw other regions, cities new,
As the world rushed by on either side.
I thought,---All labour, yet no less
Bear up beneath their unsuccess.
Look at the end of work, contrast
The petty done, the undone vast,
This present of theirs with the hopeful past!
I hoped she would love me; here we ride.
VI.
What hand and brain went ever paired?
What heart alike conceived and dared?
What act proved all its thought had been?
What will but felt the fleshly screen?
We ride and I see her bosom heave.
There's many a crown for who can reach,
Ten lines, a statesman's life in each!
The flag stuck on a heap of bones,
A soldier's doing! what atones?
They scratch his name on the Abbey-stones.
My riding is better, by their leave.
VII.
What does it all mean, poet? Well,
Your brains beat into rhythm, you tell
What we felt only; you expressed
You hold things beautiful the best,
And pace them in rhyme so, side by side.
'Tis something, nay 'tis much: but then,
Have you yourself what's best for men?
Are you---poor, sick, old ere your time---
Nearer one whit your own sublime
Than we who never have turned a rhyme?
Sing, riding's a joy! For me, I ride.
VIII.
And you, great sculptor---so, you gave
A score of years to Art, her slave,
And that's your Venus, whence we turn
To yonder girl that fords the burn!
You acquiesce, and shall I repine?
What, man of music, you grown grey
With notes and nothing else to say,
Is this your sole praise from a friend,
``Greatly his opera's strains intend,
``Put in music we know how fashions end!''
I gave my youth; but we ride, in fine.
IX.
Who knows what's fit for us? Had fate
Proposed bliss here should sublimate
My being---had I signed the bond---
Still one must lead some life beyond,
Have a bliss to die with, dim-descried.
This foot once planted on the goal,
This glory-garland round my soul,
Could I descry such? Try and test!
I sink back shuddering from the quest.
Earth being so good, would heaven seem best?
Now, heaven and she are beyond this ride.
X.
And yet---she has not spoke so long!
What if heaven be that, fair and strong
At life's best, with our eyes upturned
Whither life's flower is first discerned,
We, fixed so, ever should so abide?
What if we still ride on, we two
With life for ever old yet new,
Changed not in kind but in degree,
The instant made eternity,---
And heaven just prove that I and she
Ride, ride together, for ever ride?"
1967,Emotion,TogetherPoemsTogetherPoembySiegfriedSassoon,"Splashing along the boggy woods all day,
And over brambled hedge and holding clay,
I shall not think of him:
But when the watery fields grow brown and dim,
And hounds have lost their fox, and horses tire,
I know that he’ll be with me on my way
Home through the darkness to the evening fire.
He’s jumped each stile along the glistening lanes;
His hand will be upon the mud-soaked reins;
Hearing the saddle creak,
He’ll wonder if the frost will come next week.
I shall forget him in the morning light;
And while we gallop on he will not speak:
But at the stable-door he’ll say good-night."
1968,Emotion,TogetherPoemsTogetherPoembyAllysonGordon,"We will hold hands together
Laugh and smile together
Share our secrets together
And help each other together
We will confess our fears together
Wipe each other’s tears together
Confort each other together
And confide in each other together
We will talk about the darkness together
Write depressing poems together
Slit our wrists together
Scream in pain together
We will embrace sorrow together
Feel each other’s pain together
Plan our deaths together
And endure our suicides together"
1969,Emotion,TogetherPoemsAmos33Can2WalkTogetherExceptTheyBeAgreedPoembyLukeEaster,"Amos 3: 3, 'Can 2 walk together, except they be agreed? '
Main problem in the world today is too much controversy,
With an understanding that no one will ever be perfection,
It sure makes it a lot easier to walk in the same direction.
I've said it many times before and I will say it again,
The person saying, 'you can't' is not a true friend,
While you see a new beginning as they see the end,
Seeking to repair, they feel it's impossible to mend.
You're not a gangster so do you hang out with thugs?
You never get high but your best friend does drugs?
Who is engaged to a smoker while they hate the stink?
Why go bar hopping every night and you don't drink?
A doubter has what in common with one who believes?
Do givers like people whose only function is to receive?
Can joy or happiness be found in those that like to grieve?
What genius buys and keeps a pet that makes them sneeze?
You want the right thing; your partner yearns for the wrong,
Is there any mystery why the two of you can never get along?
Friendship in your life is never determined by color or race,
While the 'in crowd' you run with preach and practice hate?
Your soul mate is at Duke and you attend UNC, all is cool,
One is at the game, the other watches on TV that's ok too,
As long as both individuals live by and follow all the rules,
It doesn't matter that you are students in different schools.
Matthew 18: 19, 'Again I say, if two of you shall agree, '
Ecclesiastes 4: 12, talks about the greater power of three,
Psalm 133: 1, 'how good for brethren to dwell in unity, '
I trust the bible so I have no reason not to believe in 'we.'
Have you ever fixed something using tubes of Epoxy glue?
It will not become effective until you've combined the two,
Numbers 13, only Joshua and Caleb believed they could do,
From the twelve tribes of Israel in which category are you?
A basic concept behind the multiplied power of synergy,
Adding another to myself is a greater force than only me,
Giving credence to the intense pressure in common ability,
Not just left or right, with both eyes open more we'll see.
Something that I do although in scripture you will not find,
Make a confession in unison between my heart and mind,
It's a statement made when I'm in my prayer closet alone,
We all know that charity not only begins but ends at home.
To move forward we must be likeminded in our decision,
For blurred slight distorts and will only result in division,
Who can proceed in unison along the road named divide?
As allies unite to win a battle while fighting side by side.
The fastest mule will never compete with the slowest horse,
And over 60% of marriages worldwide shall end in divorce,
So, how can wedded bliss turn into bitterness and remorse?
Failure to communicate via compromise and stay the course.
What is the purpose of this poem, why this particular write?
The color of darkness is never only disguised by the night,
Be careful when choosing someone to patch or fill a need,
Amos 3: 3, 'Can 2 walk together, except they be agreed? '"

1971,Emotion,TogetherPoemsHereWeAreTogetherPoembyauthorunknown,"In this world of bitter ends,
Long lost letter to a friend:
This is my entry.
I hope this finds you pleasantly,
Without long regrets or sad bitterness.
I always thought you were the strong one
Out of all my useless friends.
Look at you now! How long it's been!
Heard you were some famous artist,
And you fell in love again.
I always thought you'd save your love for me...
Oh well...
Can you believe what they're saying on the news?
All them fakers stealing their own lines
They call these bandits 'reality stars, '
What a laugh it is now.
I could never imagine selling myself.
That's something I saved for you.
Do you remember me?
Remember how it used to be?
When we'd share our music in the park,
We'd whisper lines of poetry in the dark,
I always loved you.
I don't even know who I'm writing this to.
If I met them now or later,
Or maybe it was another lifetime,
When I was a flower or a bird,
Or maybe in another world,
Another galaxy, far off, unknown.
But you were always the one, the one I shared my stories to,
And no one really gets it like you do:
You are my chosen one."

so promise me will always be together"
1973,Emotion,TogetherPoemsPiecedTogetherFromShredsPoembyLawrenceSPertillar,"You say you don't understand,
What it is I am trying to convey?
And you read again and again...
Still not comprehending?
In a way you think,
What I've said should be understood...
For a quick dot connection,
To determine if it's bad or good!
To digest after reading?
For an analyst it...
Or I may be needing.
But I like the thought of bleeding...
A multiple meaning instead.
I love it when that double entendre is done!
And whatever I have said,
Gets to be a memory in one's head!
I'm not going to make an interpretation easy.
Especially after I have to sit and wonder...
What is 'it' that I mean?
And if I've said anything,
I may later dread.
This 'Rubik's Cube' of teasing thoughts...
Would be more acceptable,
If presented to readers...
Pieced together from shreds!
Maybe I should introduce,
A variety of colors one could use?
'Blue' would be confusion.
'Yellow'?
Too far off track to get!
'White'?
Neither one of us are right!
And 'red'?
Something has been fed...
That can put this 'mess' to bed!

In life
And in dreams"
1975,Emotion,TogetherPoemsLivingTogetherPoembyRaymondCRussell,"Why does mankind hate people based on religion and race?
Is it ignorance, education, or governments deciding our place.
For people are people regardless of the color of their face.
And the love in our hearts is an example of God's grace.
European people are the most powerful people under the sun.
Asians, Blacks, and Jews are constantly under the economic gun.
But people should not be exploited because of the color of skin.
White people must reject racism for a world of love to begin.
But are not Blacks, Jews, and Asians also guilty of racism?
For some of their religious leaders are advocates of separatism.
Now all people, whites, Asians, Jews,and Blacks, live on earth.
For racism will show God how much our souls are really worth.
All people will die and their bodies will stink becoming dirt.
And the devil will have the souls of all racist to forever hurt.
For Love is the most powerful force throughout the world.
Conquering all obstacles and causing racist minds to whirl.
We can't take money religion family or hate when we die.
But we can take love, and send it back to those who will cry.
For only love will cure any grieving and lonely heart.
And cause a no-good son or daughter to give life another start.
People are just human beings regardless of their ethnic pride.
So people should try to constantly look spiritually inside.
So forget about religion racism and discriminating government.
Because only Brotherhood will eliminate all bills and the rent."
1976,Emotion,TogetherPoemsTheLastRideTogetherAfterBrowningPoembyJamesKennethStephen,"(From Her Point of View)
When I had firmly answered 'No',
And he allowed that that was so,
I really thought I should be free
For good and all from Mr B.,
And that he would soberly acquiesce:
I said that it would be discreet
That for a while we should not meet;
I promised I would always feel
A kindly interest in his weal;
I thanked him for his amorous zeal;
In short, I said all I could but 'yes'.
I said what I'm accustomed to,
I acted as I always do;
I promised he should find in me
A friend, - a sister, if that might be:
But he was still dissatisfied:
He certainly was most polite;
He said exactly what was right,
He acted very properly,
Except indeed for this, that he
Insisted on inviting me
To come with him for 'one more last ride'.
A little while in doubt I stood:
A ride, no doubt, would do me good:
I had a habit and a hat
Extremely well worth looking at:
The weather was distinctly fine:
My horse too wanted exercise,
And time, when one is riding, flies:
Besides it really seemed, you see,
The only way of ridding me
Of pertinacious Mr B.:
So my head I graciously incline.
I won't say much of what happened next:
I own I was extremely vexed:
Indeed I should have been aghast
If anyone had seen what passed:
But nobody need ever know
That, as I leaned forward to stir the fire,
He advanced before I could well retire,
And I suddenly felt, to my great alarm,
The grasp of a warm unlicensed arm,
An embrace in which I found no charm;
I was awfully glad when he let me go.
Then we began to ride: my steed
Washer fresh, too fresh indeed,
And at first I thought of little, save
The way to escape an early grave,
As the dust rose up on either side.
My stern companion jogged along
On a brown old cob both broad and strong:
He looked as he does when he's writing verse,
Or endeavouring not to swear and curse,
Or wondering where he has left his purse,
Indeed it was a sombre ride.
I spoke of the weather to Mr B.,
But he neither listened nor spoke to me;
I praised his horse, and I smiled the smile
Which was wont to move him once on a while;
I said I was wearing his favourite flowers:
But I wasted my words on the desert air,
For he rode with a fixed and gloomy stare:
I wonder what he was thinking about:
As I don't read verse, I shan't find out:
It was something subtle and deep, no doubt,
A theme to detain a man for hours.
Ah! there was the corner where Mr S.
So nearly induced me to whisper 'yes':
And here it was that the next but one
Proposed on horseback, or would have done,
Had his horse not most opportunely shied;
Which perhaps was due to an unseen flick
He received from my whip: 'twas a scurvy trick,
But I never could do with that young man:
I hope his present young woman can.
Well, I must say, never, since time began,
Did I go for a duller or longer ride.
He never smiles and he never speaks:
He might go on like this for weeks:
He rolls a slightly frenzied eye
Towards the blue and burning sky,
And the cob bounds on with tireless stride,
If we aren't at home for lunch at two
I don't know what Papa will do;
But I know full well he will say to me
'I never approved of Mr B.;
It's the very devil that you and he
Ride, ride together, for ever ride.'"
1977,Emotion,TogetherPoemsBetterTogetherForeverPart1PoembyMichaelSmith,"Love.
Indeed the strongest word ever.
Love + You = Our Life Together.
Now I know it's obvious.
That you love me more than ever.
Let's cut the small talk & be together.
On a candlelit evening.
I imagine us together.
Happiness & good weather.
All the good times with you get better & better.
But the bad times with you.
I'm still glad that we're together.
So love me in the morning, noon, and the evening.
Forever.
Always stay true to this.
And we'll always be together.

1978,Emotion,TogetherPoemsTheComingTogetherPoembyUshaPisharody,"Joy
In the birdsong
At dawn;
In the little children's laughter
At play.
Faith
In the eye that waits
To see the homecoming;
In the anticipation
Of a smile coming one's way.
Hope
As that angel,
Hidden, yet guiding, always;
With a knowledge of a light
At the tunnel's end.
And Love-
Yes, Love, that culmination
Of emotion, glad and sad.
That surrender,
To the soul,
And soulmate.
It was with an
Unextinguished hope,
And the certain faith,
That I found that
Simple Joy-
When Love came calling,
With you.
As you!"
1979,Emotion,TogetherPoemsWalkingTogetherPoembyswateesripada,"Long back
When you were you
And I was I
We walked together side by side
Trying to keep our thoughts
Hand in hand
Fumbling for sameness
And painting for an abstract future
We walked together awake or in slumber
Holding the thought of togetherness
In the midst of a vortex
Then
We walked together
Step in step
When I became you
And you became me
We walked miles together
Having together a sip of life
Even if it was sweet or elixir
Bitter or with venom
Tasting each other's tears
imaging inner souls and
flying high and falling down to hell
we walked together
Suddenly
a thought of teasing
you vanish as a dewdropp
but still we walk together
it's not for others but I feel your touch
holding my little finger
to transfer unseen strength
to complete the journey
we walk together
my slow steps in your long strides
my tired soul
getting consoled in your unseen hands
my feathery body
leaning on your shoulder
we walk together
day and night
till the twilight of life
we walk together"
1980,Emotion,TogetherPoemsWeFlowTogetherPoembyMaryWismer,"There's must be some hard times
As we're learning to give and to share.
But we'll find there strength
In every Prayer.
Like sweet Music we flow together.
Like a song that last forever
We share out love that's so much better,
Than this world could ever know.
We'll stay in-love
In love of the lasting kind,
That binds our hearts together.
That wont be over till forever.
Like the wind that keeps on blowing.
Like the star's that keep on glowing.
Like a river that keeps on flowing
Our love will surely grow.

1981,Emotion,TogetherPoemsWeHaveBeenFriendsTogetherPoembyCarolineElizabethSarahNorton,"WE have been friends together,
In sunshine and in shade;
Since first beneath the chestnut-trees
In infancy we played.
But coldness dwells within thy heart,
A cloud is on thy brow;
We have been friends together—
Shall a light word part us now?
We have been gay together;
We have laugh’d at little jests;
For the fount of hope was gushing
Warm and joyous in our breasts.
But laughter now hath fled thy lip,
And sullen glooms thy brow;
We have been gay together—
Shall a light word part us now?
We have been sad together,
We have wept, with bitter tears,
O’er the grass-grown graves, where slumber’d
The hopes of early years.
The voices which are silent there
Would bid thee clear thy brow;
We have been sad together—
Oh! what shall part us now?"
1982,Emotion,TogetherPoemsTheEnvironmentalCleansingOfSoulsWhereBirdsOfAFeatherFlockTogetherPoembyTedSheridan,"There were church bells ringing
and the sound of their beautiful music attracted
flocks of people who looked like pelicans and quail;
some with web feet and others with talons,
some with strong beaks and others with broken wings;
some came to sing and others came to dance
but all were in need of someone, someone to love
and care for them. And the church bells guided them
into the sanctuary of the Birdman; where they could
be washed and cleansed of the crude oil. Even those
who were like crows and whose sheer nature it was to
scavenge on the weak and dying, even they
had been thoroughly soaked in the evil sludge.
But blessed are all who call his name.
From the sparrow to the vulture,
by his promise all shall fly once more…

Let us spend a few moments together,

Holding hands, laughing.
It's over for us...
Except for Death.
You picked that awful blouse
At Penny's...never approved
Of your taste...
You knew it.
Laughed each time I made
A face...
You looked good in anything.
You knew it.
You smiled in memory...
Weren't they good
Weren't they happy...
The long hours of work.
I don't want to remember.
Went to your house one day.
You were talking funny,
Walking funny.
'Oh, I just feel bad.'
You liar! You damned liar!
We were Thelma and Louise.
You named us that...I had the
Convertible. You...no Time.
Let us go, hand in hand, into
The horizon. Always the West.
You always knew Sunsets
Always become Sunrises.
Let's go over the cliff together.
You always wanted to see God.
You'll not be seeing Him
For the first time.
God saw you...and kept you.
Goodbye, my friend."

We work as one
Though there may be times

Like saying 'good-bye'
When this happens
We shouldn't lose heart
For of 'something greater'
We are all a part
Each one of us
Has a role to play
In making this
A brighter day
We work together
For the good of all
It's in our hearts
Where we feel the call

Every heart that shares

Just listen to your heart
For it wants you to stay.

1989,Emotion,TogetherPoemsForeverTogetherPoembyJessicaJessica,"He's often sad, rarely smiles for a reason,
He’s always numb, even in the summer season.
He loves the cold, the wind and the rain,
He does not sleep, he's in so much pain.
He wants to leave this life behind,
But there is one girl who stays on his mind.
He tells her he loves her, then whispers goodbye,
He grabs the rope and hangs it up high.
Tears start to run as she grabs the knife,
And on that night they both took their life."

Or expect respect.
That should be given.
Of that I do not neglect.
And you expect it?
When you neglect it?

I don't welcome with attacks.
To bite and then regret.
To greet and meet to leave upset.

I welcome not condescend.
Nor do I solicit attention,
To be focused on me.
Using that as a forum,
To exploit me on the scene.
I am not like you.
I could never be like that.
But I can be quite indignant,
When I learn I've been scandalized...
Behind my back,
By you.
I am not like you,
And you are just like that.
Bitter.
And unable to forgive.
Baiting to become the center of attention.
And using me as the subject,
Of your sorrows.
I am not you,
But you are just like that.
And that is why you and I,
Have no tomorrows...
To await for apologies to soothe.
With alibis and excuses too.
I am not you,
But you are just like that.
And that is why you and I,
Could never experience another forever,
Ever together,
Again."
1991,Emotion,FirePoemsTheBoyWithFireInHisEyesPoembyDanielNairn,"The boy with fire in his eyes
Stands there waiting.
It is his soul inside;
It keeps him standing.
And if ever the fire goes out,
He will freeze in the cold.
It is his heat
And all that  keeps him living.
Or if it never is put to use,
It will consume him;
He will burn to the ground
His ashes left behind.
But if the fire blazes,
If kindled, kept and carried,
If the boy with fire in his eyes
Finds life inside that fire,
His fire will light the world,
Will pierce the mist,
A fire to drive the dark away
Forever and ever more."
1992,Emotion,FirePoems10CaughtInTheFirePoembynicolaburkett,"At that moment in time, the point of no return
You’re standing inside the fire watching yourself burn
You don't feel the pain as you stand comfortably numb
Watching your life unfold, watching it come undone
You’re caught in the fire as you break down and cry
Watching your life fade as you wave it goodbye
You touch the fire but it freezes you, you want the feeling back
Watching the smoke fill your eyes as it turns to a void of black
You'll do anything, whatever it takes not to fade away
Anything instead of watching your life burn everyday
You'll do anything to stop your heart from turning to dust
Anything to stop your tears creating a life turned to rust
You need to find that once bright encompassing spark
The reason that will pull you into the light and out of the dark
Words of wisdom can save you, if only you can be told
You need to hide from the flames and run from the cold
You no longer want to wave your life a tearful goodbye
You no longer wish to stand inside the fire and cry
At that moment in time, the point of no return
You no longer wish to watch yourself burn"
1993,Emotion,FirePoemsToSomeIHaveTalkedWithByTheFirePoembyWilliamButlerYeats,"WHILE I wrought out these fitful Danaan rhymes,
My heart would brim with dreams about the times
When we bent down above the fading coals
And talked of the dark folk who live in souls
Of passionate men, like bats in the dead trees;
And of the wayward twilight companies
Who sigh with mingled sorrow and content,
Because their blossoming dreams have never bent
Under the fruit of evil and of good:
And of the embattled flaming multitude
Who rise, wing above wing, flame above flame,
And, like a storm, cry the Ineffable Name,
And with the clashing of their sword-blades make
A rapturous music, till the morning break
And the white hush end all but the loud beat
Of their long wings, the flash of their white feet."

the fire inside of me
that will burn my soul
and i will die
b/c they fed the fire
they call me names
mock me
and worse of all
make fun of my freinds
when they do this
the fire grows
burning my insides
starting with my toes
it gets bigger
then goes to my liver stomoch and lungs
then finally my heart
then im gone
some will cry and feel bad
some will laugh and say im psycho
the ones that laugh
will move on
and build a fire

1995,Emotion,FirePoemsAFirePoembyHerbertNehrlich,"It was so fulminating.
A fire burned within
from spindly kindling
and a breath of air
it sprang to life
consuming obstacles
and dull objections
and stark conventions.
Iit jumped all gaps
yet was not seen
by those who could
and bravely would
rise in defence
in bold offence.
So unexpected,
not wished for even,
it took on quickly
and without mercy
a life of egotistic
and autonomic
well, somewhat comic
and drooling presence.
So unprepared
so stunned and scared
yet breathing in
this deadly fragrance
and longing for
the nectar of
a soul ordained
for me alone
and nought is left
to say or do
we were as such
simply because
we had to be
it was a law
of nature
one which can not
be broken
by mere humans.
A fire burns
so cleanly when
the darkness
of our doubts
is absent.
And as I float
in saddened waves
of smoke and seek
those mirrors
which could give,
perhaps be saviours
for answers
from my soul
and heart
my tortured mind
does not perceive
what she must know,
perhaps relieved
and rescued in
the nick of love
from devastation.
I miss you so
my heartease flower
but hope you will
not hear those words
or feel the heat
or smell the smoke.
And if you see
a distant fire
be not alarmed
the smoke has gone."
1996,Emotion,FirePoemsMomentOfFirePoembyTheBlackRose,"Heavens on fire as the last day burns out the sky,
Setting the world with an eerie orange glow,
Streaked through with pinks and reds,
Stealing the breath of those below,
I wish i could steal your breath in another way,
Passion,
Lust,
Desire,
driving me on,
on to the moment...
You can feel it,
tingle in your lips,
to your fingers,
down to your toes,
Electric like your bodys never known,
If i touched you now,
I could see it,
Leap between skin,
Hand on your shoulder,
my breath in your ear,
the fire is in me,
a romantic desire that ill never let die,
The question is,
with the air alight,
& the moment forever close,
What do you Desire?"
1997,Emotion,FirePoemsFireAndIcePoembyDavidHagberg,"We come into this world with nothing and we depart with nothing. You departed with nothing. Yet you took everything.
There was something omnious about that night, something gloomy, something fateful. Maybe it was the wind and the rain. Maybe just a feeling. I suppose a fitting night to leave this world as we all eventually must. With nothing. Our final flight wont be delayed.
Why you had to leave I do not know. I do not understand. Maybe it is not for me to know, not for me to understand.
You where fire. I was ice. You melted me. I soothed you.
Alas, a burning soul will always leave this world in flames, as was your fate. Myself?  I returned to my cold home in the north where ice belongs, with nothing.
Nothing."
1998,Emotion,FirePoemsLoveIsAFriendshipThatHasCaughtFirePoembyCaronFarnham,"It appears as a quiet understanding
trust, sharing and forgiving
Love remains loyal through good and bad
it settles for less than perfection
and makes allowances for human weakness
Love feels content with the present
it hopes for the future
it doesn't brood over the past
Love includes the day in day of chronicle
of irrations, problems and compromises
the small disappointmets, big victories and common goals
If you have love in your life
it can make up for a great many things you be
If you don't have it
no matter what else you have
it never feels enough."
1999,Emotion,FirePoemsTheTractorFirePoembyHerbertNehrlich,"It was decided that the shed
- an eyesore - had to go,
so, after rolling out of bed
at  5, I'd  start the show.
A careful fire now, to burn
the boards, dismantled, one by one.
I use  the tractor - push and turn,
support beams fall  - I'm having fun.
When suddenly my front wheels stick
deep in the ground, I try reverse.
I may, if this fails, have to dig,
so now I start to yell and curse.
The fire, fuelled by roof tar,
is getting closer by the minute!
I'm trying! - something is bizarre,
it's sticky mud and I am in it.
'So get the hose ', I yell out loud,
'and call the  neighbour, hurry, kids! '
there's just a trickle coming out,
it's getting hot, I lose my wits.
As Maurice comes with his John Deere
and chain and hooks and other gear,
the flames have reached the tractor tyre.
I pray that God would douse the fire.
Accelerate, now pull and yank
but nothing moves, it's getting hot.
My eyes are on the petrol tank,
I wonder 'will I now blow up? '
At last the efforts are succeeding
and all the wheels are slowly turning.
With Maurice and his monster leading
it's high time 'cause my seat is burning!
And so we saved the day, yes Mister.
The damage was  a half-burned tyre,
a charcoaled seat, a rear-end blister,
but we escaped - and WHAT a fire!
The fire engines screaming in,
with lights a-flashing, sirens, tooting,
they're knocking down the garbage bin,
the trucks look shiny, high fallutin'.
The chief is known to us - a local.
He asks what I will not forget,
presents himself, high-pitched and vocal:
'So, put it out? '    -   I say  'You bet! '"
2000,Emotion,FirePoemsUponFirePoembyJohnBunyan,"Who falls into the fire shall burn with heat;
While those remote scorn from it to retreat.
Yea, while those in it, cry out, O! I burn,
Some farther off those cries to laughter turn.
Comparison.
While some tormented are in hell for sin;
On earth some greatly do delight therein.
Yea, while some make it echo with their cry,
Others count it a fable and a lie."
2001,Emotion,FirePoemsWineByTheFireOnAColdWinterNightPoembyJThomasJr,"Wine by the fire on a cold winter night a Gelid concordant. The snows of winter has fallen; and the
Winds are decrescent
Wildlife are
Indefatigable
In
Winter-land
Wine by the fire on a cold winter night. Monumental snows are glaciated; and the
Valleys below are elongated
In an alabaster,
Powdery
Splendor.
Engaging winter, where polar bears are denning
And accumbented in a long
Winter sleep. Winter's prelusory; for the translucent amber,
Gild, of autumn to a dulcify
In their joining. As we dine epicurean, in the comforts of clover;
And bonivant on tasty
Wines.
Wine by the fire on a cold winter night as we
Amorously commingle as one in  A fervent that's
Second to  None And the taste of
Wine by the fire on a cold winter
Night."
2002,Emotion,FirePoemsFireFlyCityPoembyHenryVanDyke,"Like a long arrow through the dark the train is darting,
Bearing me far away, after a perfect day of love's delight:
Wakeful with all the sad-sweet memories of parting,
I lift the narrow window-shade and look out on the night.
Lonely the land unknown, and like a river flowing,
Forest and field and hill are gliding backward still athwart my dream;
Till in that country strange, and ever stranger growing,
A magic city full of lights begins to glow and gleam.
Wide through the landscape dim the lamps are lit in millions;
Long avenues unfold clear-shining lines of gold across the green;
Clusters and rings of light, and luminous pavilions, --
Oh, who will tell the city's name, and what these wonders mean?
Why do they beckon me, and what have they to show me?
Crowds in the blazing street, mirth where the feasters meet, kisses and wine:
Many to laugh with me, but never one to know me:
A cityful of stranger-hearts and none to beat with mine!
Look how the glittering lines are wavering and lifting, --
Softly the breeze of night, scatters the vision bright: and, passing fair,
Over the meadow-grass and through the forest drifting,
The Fire-Fly City of the Dark is lost in empty air!
Girl of the golden eyes, to you my heart is turning:
Sleep in your quiet room, while through the midnight gloom my train is whirled.
Clear in your dreams of me the light of love is burning, --
The only never failing light in all the phantom world."
2003,Emotion,FirePoemsFSilentFirePoemby,"Tell me which fight do you fight deep in you
My body shakes in waves of pain you feel
I see your fear is too dark to look through
No moon can help when I want you to heal
I say no words for fear that they can’t help
While seeds on fire burn the future wood
Though all I wish for is to make walls melt
While cries in silence doubt what I found good
Please trust me for just that I just trust you
Please fight the fear and show to me your face
There is this world but you and I are too
Don't be a rose hidén behind a vase
Oh please be brave to speak to me now true
Whatever happens I will still love you"
2004,Emotion,FirePoemsARefusalToMournTheDeathByFireOfAChildInLondonPoembyDylanThomas,"Never until the mankind making
Bird beast and flower
Fathering and all humbling darkness
Tells with silence the last light breaking
And the still hour
Is come of the sea tumbling in harness
And I must enter again the round
Zion of the water bead
And the synagogue of the ear of corn
Shall I let pray the shadow of a sound
Or sow my salt seed
In the least valley of sackcloth to mourn
The majesty and burning of the child's death.
I shall not murder
The mankind of her going with a grave truth
Nor blaspheme down the stations of the breath
With any further
Elegy of innocence and youth.
Deep with the first dead lies London's daughter,
Robed in the long friends,
The grains beyond age, the dark veins of her mother,
Secret by the unmourning water
Of the riding Thames.
After the first death, there is no other."
2005,Emotion,FirePoemsFireOnTheHillsPoembyRobinsonJeffers,"The deer were bounding like blown leaves
Under the smoke in front the roaring wave of the brush-fire;
I thought of the smaller lives that were caught.
Beauty is not always lovely; the fire was beautiful, the terror
Of the deer was beautiful; and when I returned
Down the back slopes after the fire had gone by, an eagle
Was perched on the jag of a burnt pine,
Insolent and gorged, cloaked in the folded storms of his shoulders
He had come from far off for the good hunting
With fire for his beater to drive the game; the sky was merciless
Blue, and the hills merciless black,
The sombre-feathered great bird sleepily merciless between them.
I thought, painfully, but the whole mind,
The destruction that brings an eagle from heaven is better than mercy."
2006,Emotion,FirePoemsTheFireStillBurnsPoembyDavidHarris,"Fire never dies, just smoulders,
like love you need to fan it,
to keep the flame alive.
Like the smouldering embers,
that needs only a little attention,
to become a flame again.
So the parting lovers,
need only to kiss to ignite the flame,
and start the passion again."
2007,Emotion,FirePoemsSirenOfFirePoembyTatiannaReiMoonshadow,"Fire:
When the water turns to mist
And the flames are rising high
I'll appear to you my darling
To wipe the tears from your eyes
I'll dance around the fire pit
Running wild with the flames
But as soon as the fire is out
I'll leave you without so much as my name
Water:
When water extinguishes the flame
It will also extinguish me
I will leave you to yourself
To soak in memory
When the land is watered down
And you stand beside the sea
Look for the bonfires
For that is where you'll find me
Burned:
Don't play with fire dearest
You know you will be burned
Leave the flames to me my love
They remind me of how I've yearned
For the sensation of my fire
That keeps our passions hot
I'll stay with you until the tide comes in
But after, I cannot
Drowned:
They douse the flames with water
Putting out the light
I drown with the flames
That ensnared you all night
I cannot stay with you now
My flames have been drowned out
But remember whenever you need me
Fire will bring me about"
2008,Emotion,FirePoemsSittingByTheFirePoembyHannahSmith,"Sitting by the fire,
Warming up my toes,
Last year is over,
But a new year has come
Packed with lots of things,
Sleeping at night,
Staring up at the ceiling.
Waking up at the morning
Streching my armes out wide,
It's so nice waking up to a new day.
Lots of adventures on their way! ! !"
2009,Emotion,FirePoemsTheMalleeFirePoembyCharlesHenrySoutar,"I SUPPOSE it just depends on where you’re raised,
Once I met a cove as swore by green belar!
Couldn’t sight the good old mallee-stump I praised;
Well!—I couldn’t sight belar, and there you are!
But the faces in the fire where the mallee stump’s a-blinking
Are the friendliest I ever seen, to my way o’ thinking!
In the city where the fires is mostly coal—
There! I can’t a-bear to go and warm my feet!
Spitting, fizzing things as hasn’t got no soul!
Things as puffs out yaller smoke instead of heat!
But at home—well, it is home when the mallee-stump’s a-burning,
And the evenin’s drawing chilly and the season is a-turning.
And there’s some as runs ’em down because they’re tough.
Well? And what’s the good of anythink as ain’t?
No. It’s nary use to serve ’em any bluff,
For they’d use up all the patience of a saint.
But they’ll split as sweet as sugar if you know the way to take ’em;
If you don’t, there isn’t nothink in the world as’ll make ’em.
They’re tremenjus hard to kindle, tho’, at first:
Like the friendship of the kind that comes to stay.
You can blow and blow and blow until you burst,
And when they won’t, they won’t burn, anyway!
But when once they gets a start, tho’ they make no showy flashes,
Well, they’ll serve you true and honest to the last pinch of ashes"
2010,Emotion,FirePoemsTheFireBellsAreRingingPoembyHenryClayWork,"One, two, three--hark, hark, boys!
One, two, three, four!
The fire-bells are ringing, this wild wintry night;
They ask aid from District Thirty-four,
There somebody's riches are now taking flight;
On flame-wings away, away they soar.
But hark!
With shriek and wail,
How raves the gale!
Like demon steeds it speeds--
like galloping gangs from Pandemonium hurl'd.
Yes, firemen, take courage! did valiant deeds avail,
Then you were the victors of the world.
Ring the bells again!
Wake the electric wire!
And flash abroad the warning words--
""FIRE! FIRE!""

When fierce flames with wintry winds conspire,

But God help in District Thirty-four,
What's that?
Look there! look there!
A lurid glare
Lights up the sky--aye, aye!
and columns of red, devouring flame appear.
And see! for departure our neighbors prepare;
Perchance there is danger even here.
One, two, three--hark, hark, boys!
One, two, three, four!

How vast must the conflagration be!
Our own roof is blazing! yet where, free from harm,
Oh! where shall we our treasures flee?
Let's haste!
'Twill fall! 'Twill fall--
That granite wall;
I see it crumbling, tumbling!
Fly for your lives, from out this fiery grave!
Laid low, crush'd, buried are some beyond recall;
But thank God! my little flock I save."

2012,Emotion,FirePoemsTheGreatChicagoFirePoembyJuliaAnnMoore,"The great Chicago Fire, friends,
Will never be forgot;
In the history of Chicago
It will remain a darken spot.
It was a dreadful horrid sight
To see that City in flames;
But no human aid could save it,
For all skill was tried in vain.
In the year of 1871,
In October on the 8th,
The people in that City, then
Was full of life, and great.
Less than four days it lay in ruins,
That garden City, so great
Lay smouldering in ashes,
In a sad and pitiful state.
It was a sad, sad scene indeed,
To see the fire arise,
And hear the crackling of the flames
As it almost reached the skies,
And sadder still, to hear the moans,
Of people in the flames
Cry for help, and none could get,
Ah, die where they remained.
To see the people run for life;
Up and down the blazing streets,
To find then, their escape cut off
By the fiery flaming sheets,
And others hunting for some friend
That perhaps they never found,
Such weeping, wailing, never was known,
For a thousands miles around.
Some people were very wealthy
On the morning of the 10th.
But at the close of the evening,
Was poor, but felt content,
Glad to escape from harm with life
With friends they loved so well,
Some will try to gain more wisdom,
By the sad sight they beheld.
Five thousand people were homeless,
Sad wanderers in the streets,
With no shelter to cover them,
And no food had they to eat.
They wandered down by the lake side,
Lay down on the cold damp ground,
So tired and weary and homeless,
So the rich, the poor, was found.
Mothers with dear little infants,
Some clinging to the breast.
People of every description
All laid down there to rest,
With the sky as their covering,
Ah, pillows they had none.
Sad, oh sad, it must have been,
For those poor homeless ones.
Neighboring Cities sent comfort,
To the poor lone helpless ones,
And God will not forget them
In all the years to come.
Now the City of Chicago
Is built up anew once more,
And may it never be visited
With such a great fire no more."
2013,Emotion,FirePoemsTheFireThatFilledMyHeartOfOldPoembyJamesThomson,"The fire that filled my heart of old
Gave luster while it burned;
Now only ashes gray and cold
Are in its silence urned.
Ah! better was the furious flame,
The splendor with the smart;
I never cared for the singer's fame
But, oh! for the singer's heart
Once more--
The burning fulgent heart!
No love, no hate, no hope, no fear,
No anguish and no mirth;
Thus life extends from year to year,
A flat of sullen dearth.
Ah! life's blood creepeth cold and tame,
Life's thought plays no new part;
I never cared for the singer's fame,
But, oh! for the singer's heart
Once more--
The bleeding passionate heart!"
2014,Emotion,FirePoemsSonnetDeathByFirePoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"What gory deaths by fire, we see today!
Gone is ‘sati’ but brides burn still by stove;
In accidents too, people die this way;
Self-immolate, some people out of love!
Air-crash victims get burnt like wood and hay;
Bomb-blasts produces smell of burning flesh;
Bus burns with men in pugilistic way!
And nuclear accidents too happen fresh.
A cracker-unit burns its children down;
A Temple-fire engulfs so many souls;
Some men are dowsed, lit live in a big town;
Fire-extinguishers have but scarcer roles.
’Tis strange to see why people burn alive!
What kind of pleasure, Satans such derive?"
2015,Emotion,FirePoemsYeaTheRosesAreStillOnFirePoembyMathildeBlind,"Yea, the roses are still on fire
With the bygone heat of July,
Though the least little wind drifting by
Shake a rose-leaf or two from the brier,
Be it never so soft a sigh.
Ember of love still glows and lingers
Deep at the red heart's smouldering core;
With the sudden passionate throb of yore
We shook as our eyes and clinging fingers
Met once only to meet no more."
2016,Emotion,FirePoemsThereWasAManWhoLivedALifeOfFirePoembyStephenCrane,"There was a man who lived a life of fire.
Even upon the fabric of time,
Where purple becomes orange
And orange purple,
This life glowed,
A dire red stain, indelible;
Yet when he was dead,
He saw that he had not lived."
2017,Emotion,FirePoemsMyFirePoembyCordellRich,"I have been lonely before.
Listing between friends.
Going through the motions again and again.
Adding the moments together,
like salty drops of tears in a bitter pool.
Living a life of tepid comfort.
Without passion, fire, flame.
Like a man in a cold room
Warm and wrapped in a blanket
Comfortable, but longing for fire
For the feeling of heat on his back
With his shoulder naked
And his eyes closed
This is how I see you.
You are the fire.
You are the warm glowing embers.
The black and red hot coals
And the blue fire licking the edges
I have been lonely before.
If only I had the courage to open my eyes
You would be my fire.

2018,Emotion,FirePoemsByAnAutumnFirePoembyLucyMaudMontgomery,"Now at our casement the wind is shrilling,
Poignant and keen
And all the great boughs of the pines between
It is harping a lone and hungering strain
To the eldritch weeping of the rain;
And then to the wild, wet valley flying
It is seeking, sighing,
Something lost in the summer olden.
When night was silver and day was golden;
But out on the shore the waves are moaning
With ancient and never fulfilled desire,
And the spirits of all the empty spaces,
Of all the dark and haunted places,
With the rain and the wind on their death-white faces,
Come to the lure of our leaping fire.
But we bar them out with this rose-red splendor
From our blithe domain,
And drown the whimper of wind and rain
With undaunted laughter, echoing long,
Cheery old tale and gay old song;
Ours is the joyance of ripe fruition,
Attained ambition.
Ours is the treasure of tested loving,
Friendship that needs no further proving;
No more of springtime hopes, sweet and uncertain,
Here we have largess of summer in fee­
Pile high the logs till the flame be leaping,
At bay the chill of the autumn keeping,
While pilgrim-wise, we may go a-reaping
In the fairest meadow of memory!"
2019,Emotion,FirePoemsIceAndFirePoembyEdmundSpenser,"My love is like to ice, and I to fire:
How comes it then that this her cold so great
Is not dissolved through my so hot desire,
But harder grows the more I her entreat?
Or how comes it that my exceeding heat
Is not allayed by her heart-frozen cold,
But that I burn much more in boiling sweat,
And feel my flames augmented manifold?
What more miraculous thing may be told,
That fire, which all things melts, should harden ice,
And ice, which is congeal'd with senseless cold,
Should kindle fire by wonderful device?
Such is the power of love in gentle mind,
That it can alter all the course of kind."
2020,Emotion,FirePoemsIHaveAFireForYouInMyMouthPoembyMewlanaJalaluddinRumi,"218
I have a fire for you in my mouth, but I have a hundred seals
on my tongue.
The flames which I have in my heart would make one mouth-
ful of both worlds.
Though the entire world should pass away, without the world
I possess the kingdom of a hundred worlds.
Caravans which are loaded with sugar I have in motion for
the Egypt of nonexistence.
The drunkenness of love makes me unaware whether I have
profit of loss therefrom.
The body’s eye was scattering pearls because of love, till now
I have a pearl-scattering soul.
I am not housebound, for like Jesus I have a home in the fourth
Heaven.
Thanks be to Him who gives soul to the body; if the soul
should depart, yet I have the soul of the soul.
Seek from me that which Shams-e Tabrizi has bestowed, for
I have the same."

You cannot put a Fire out—

2023,Emotion,FirePoemsFireInIcePoembyVidushiKhera,"From underneath the frozen smile,
My heart melts to silently cry.
The burning emotions from the days
When these embers were all ablaze,
Now rekindled by the fire in your eyes,
They burn with revenge for all the times
Every eye coldly looked the other way.
Brutally wasted, they left me where I lay.
Slowly I could feel the chill in my spine
Spread more and more each and every time
The cold blind stares refused to see
The horror and pain they unleashed on me.
Had to learn to become fiercer than ice,
Colder than their coldest vice.
Had to learn to welcome with frozen smiles
All those I met as I walked the miles.
Not many bothered to stop and hold,
To seek the fire beyond the wall ice-cold.
Those who cared to stay found their place
In my heart and it’s warm embrace.
The glow of embers behind the icy wall
Beckons you as it shouts it's call,
“Break the Wall! ” it pleads to your glowing gaze
Come into my world; make your place to stay."
2024,Emotion,FirePoemsWarmthInFirePoembyMothHarris,"Embers light the fire
Brake down the bark
Fueling heart and desire
Lost from the start
Oh, but I love being lost with you
I'd say the fire lights up my life
but I don't have to
because I think you feel it too
I just want to stay here
and be warm
Right next to you
Made it passed the wire
Painted like art
Keep on rolling like a tire
You have my heart
and the blood is swirling so beautifully
I thought you'd like to hear
My every thought and word
The only problem is
It's summed up in three simple words
I love you
Singing with the choir
Never to part
You're the one I admire
Fire was the spark
and now my world is lit up so beautifully."
2025,Emotion,FirePoemsTheFireAtRosssFarmPoembyHenryLawson,"The squatter saw his pastures wide
Decrease, as one by one
The farmers moving to the west
Selected on his run;
Selectors took the water up
And all the black soil round;
The best grass-land the squatter had
Was spoilt by Ross's Ground.
Now many schemes to shift old Ross
Had racked the squatter's brains,
But Sandy had the stubborn blood
Of Scotland in his veins;
He held the land and fenced it in,
He cleared and ploughed the soil,
And year by year a richer crop
Repaid him for his toil.
Between the homes for many years
The devil left his tracks:
The squatter pounded Ross's stock,
And Sandy pounded Black's.
A well upon the lower run
Was filled with earth and logs,
And Black laid baits about the farm
To poison Ross's dogs.
It was, indeed, a deadly feud
Of class and creed and race;
But, yet, there was a Romeo
And a Juliet in the case;
And more than once across the flats,
Beneath the Southern Cross,
Young Robert Black was seen to ride
With pretty Jenny Ross.
One Christmas time, when months of drought
Had parched the western creeks,
The bush-fires started in the north
And travelled south for weeks.
At night along the river-side
The scene was grand and strange --
The hill-fires looked like lighted streets
Of cities in the range.
The cattle-tracks between the trees
Were like long dusky aisles,
And on a sudden breeze the fire
Would sweep along for miles;
Like sounds of distant musketry
It crackled through the brakes,
And o'er the flat of silver grass
It hissed like angry snakes.
It leapt across the flowing streams
And raced o'er pastures broad;
It climbed the trees and lit the boughs
And through the scrubs it roared.
The bees fell stifled in the smoke
Or perished in their hives,
And with the stock the kangaroos
Went flying for their lives.
The sun had set on Christmas Eve,
When, through the scrub-lands wide,
Young Robert Black came riding home
As only natives ride.
He galloped to the homestead door
And gave the first alarm:
`The fire is past the granite spur,
`And close to Ross's farm.'
`Now, father, send the men at once,
They won't be wanted here;
Poor Ross's wheat is all he has
To pull him through the year.'
`Then let it burn,' the squatter said;
`I'd like to see it done --
I'd bless the fire if it would clear
Selectors from the run.
`Go if you will,' the squatter said,
`You shall not take the men --
Go out and join your precious friends,
And don't come here again.'
`I won't come back,' young Robert cried,
And, reckless in his ire,
He sharply turned his horse's head
And galloped towards the fire.
And there, for three long weary hours,
Half-blind with smoke and heat,
Old Ross and Robert fought the flames
That neared the ripened wheat.
The farmer's hand was nerved by fears
Of danger and of loss;
And Robert fought the stubborn foe
For the love of Jenny Ross.
But serpent-like the curves and lines
Slipped past them, and between,
Until they reached the bound'ry where
The old coach-road had been.
`The track is now our only hope,
There we must stand,' cried Ross,
`For nought on earth can stop the fire
If once it gets across.'
Then came a cruel gust of wind,
And, with a fiendish rush,
The flames leapt o'er the narrow path
And lit the fence of brush.
`The crop must burn!' the farmer cried,
`We cannot save it now,'
And down upon the blackened ground
He dashed the ragged bough.
But wildly, in a rush of hope,
His heart began to beat,
For o'er the crackling fire he heard
The sound of horses' feet.
`Here's help at last,' young Robert cried,
And even as he spoke
The squatter with a dozen men
Came racing through the smoke.
Down on the ground the stockmen jumped
And bared each brawny arm,
They tore green branches from the trees
And fought for Ross's farm;
And when before the gallant band
The beaten flames gave way,
Two grimy hands in friendship joined --
And it was Christmas Day."

2027,Emotion,FirePoemsCourageUnderFirePoembyAdryanBarnathan,"they'll
fall away
one by one
as strands of you
milk the moments
you had
for what they were worth,
still smouldering
in the hand
even though
you knew
in your hearts mind
that
it was pretence
as they smiled
behind soft
contemptuous lips
that offer you
quiet resentment
instead of love
just because
you breathe
and are
uniquely you,
and that
makes them
uncomfortable
against their
square jawed
perfect,
materialistic plan
that can't afford
you
but can
their every whim
which makes them
sorely aware
of their
superlative selves
so they
push you away
thinking
you are less
then them
because
you don't fit
but you keep
steering steadfast
in the sanctity
of truth
inside of trust
as the most valuable
integer
and they fear
''your being''
because
through you
they see
themselves
impoverished,
and their superior
ways collapse
in blind belief
as they continue
to make spaces
''for time''
more than sharing
or listening
or caring
for anyone else
because
what they want
is never enough-
so let them fall away
to be left
as dust
when matter
does not matter
and when you are
feeling raw and
naked and
real
then you can
afford
the comfort
of being
with another
and that is
what is true
and right
and real
and what you
are all about.

2028,Emotion,FirePoemsBallsOfFirePoembyHerbertNehrlich,"It was his first, and smuggled in at that,
the Commies hadn't yet approved of things
that made the forces of free market grow.
Blue Jeans, they said were just a symbol,
they stood for what they knew as exploitation,
like nylon stockings, even pantyhose,
they were not needed in the State of workers,
and peasants who adored their stoic loyalty.
But, as so often happens, things did change,
hard currency could plug so many holes,
and tastes of those old clowns were all the same.
Thus, Trabbis mixed with Stuttgart limousines,
and colour came to visit all the grey facades,
where he was now accelerating, metal heels
were echoing back from the Brandenburger Gate.
He'd followed the instruction of the merchant then,
to soak inside a tub of frigid water, wearing them,
all Levis Jeans demanded this, it made them fit.
He recognised the STASI by their armpit bulges,
they questioned him at length about his views
of their beloved Workers' Paradise and more.
He could not speak, no words were formed
or could be heard, he stood in silence, motionless,
and visualised how millions of those little sperms
were dying as he stood, near Brandenburger Gate
with shrunken Levis Jeans, and heat inside his crotch.
A killer, so the STASI said, came always from the West.
Imperialists, warmongers who roamed in the night.
And, as the voices built toward a new crescendo
he lost his cool and screamed right into faces who
were solemn symbols of authority here in this land,
the meaning was not out of place or time, the words,
in perfect English now: 'Great balls of fire.'"
2029,Emotion,FirePoemsBalladByTheFirePoembyEdwinArlingtonRobinson,"Slowly I smoke and hug my knee,
The while a witless masquerade
Of things that only children see
Floats in a mist of light and shade:
They pass, a flimsy cavalcade,
And with a weak, remindful glow,
The falling embers break and fade,
As one by one the phantoms go.
Then, with a melancholy glee
To think where once my fancy strayed,
I muse on what the years may be
Whose coming tales are all unsaid,
Till tongs and shovel, snugly laid
Within their shadowed niches, grow
By grim degrees to pick and spade,
As one by one the phantoms go.
But then, what though the mystic Three
Around me ply their merry trade? --
And Charon soon may carry me
Across the gloomy Stygian glade? --
Be up, my soul! nor be afraid
Of what some unborn year may show;
But mind your human debts are paid,
As one by one the phantoms go.
ENVOY
Life is the game that must be played:
This truth at least, good friend, we know;
So live and laugh, nor be dismayed
As one by one the phantoms go."

While sitting backwards
Waiting for your love……

Great seduction -
A delightful foreplay
I came to prepare.
O honey! Come to me.

Please me……….hot and wild
Bring me to ecstasy land.
Don’t stop – addicted to survive!
Frame us both to fulfill our desires.
Tame my burning passion,

Boiling the waters inside
As sweet juices and lava flows,

2031,Emotion,FirePoemsPassionOfFirePoembyMistralLove,"My heart was started by a spark,
burst into flames.
Now I am like a lamp on a hill,
everyone sees me and my passion.
I'm on fire, I'm burning bright.
You made the spark,
kindled the flame,
gave this fire the passion of the night.
Its burning bright, through the night,
its never going out or dimming.
Its the passion of the fire,
its the passion of life.
The life you gave,
was meant to amaze.
Now with you in me,
I illuminate the darkness.
I'm on fire,
running with the flame, the passion
touching people,
letting them catch the fire, catch your Love.
It never fades away,
this passion deep in me,
it'll burn till the end of day."
2032,Emotion,FirePoemsBaptismByFirePoembyGainorVentrescoLaney,"How long will this go on?
Consumed daily by this passionate fire
...the way I tempt fate
tease the flame closer to my eager skin
I have taken this nameless obsession
and set it  to music
For each year that has passed
when my heart remained frozen
I have taken a vow
dedicating myself to the thawing
I feel, touch, taste each exquisite moment
Whether stolen or given as a gift
Mine now, to wrap in black velvet
keep as a treasure
One by one, I lit the candles
watched them burn
Blue, for my soul in turmoil
Red, for my one true love
Black, for that place unspoken
White....
I save for you alone
Although logic and history dispute this:
we will light it together on the darkest night
illuminate eachothers shadow
at the alter of my desire"

My eyes touch where you turn
The shouts from the fire line crew

Overrunning the west side road
We run the escape route
I hold your face to me
Always where you are"
2034,Emotion,FirePoemsTheDisastrousFireAtScarboroughPoembyWilliamTopazMcGonagall,"'Twas in the year of 1898, and on the 8th of June,
A mother and six children met with a cruel doom
In one of the most fearful fires for some years past
And as the spectators gazed upon them they stood aghast
The fire broke out in a hairdresser's, in the town of Scarborough,
And as the fire spread it filled the people's hearts with sorrow;
But the police and the fire brigade were soon on the ground,
Then the hose and reel were quickly sent round.
Oh! it was horrible to see the flames leaping up all around,
While amongst the spectators the silence was profound,
As they saw a men climb out to the parapet high,
Resolved to save his life, or in the attempt to die!
And he gave one half frantic leap, with his heart full of woe,
And came down upon the roof of a public-house 20 feet below;
But, alas! he slipped and fell through the skylight,
And received cuts and bruises: oh, what a horrible sight!
He was the tenant of the premises, Mr Brookes,
And for his wife and family he enquires, with anxious looks,
But no one could tell him, it did appear,
And when told so adown his cheeks flowed many a tear.
He had been sleeping by himself on the second floor,
When suddenly alarmed, he thought he'd make sure,
And try to escape from the burning pile with his life,
And try and save his family and his wife.
The fire brigade played on the first door with greet speed,
But the flames had very inflammable fuel upon which to feed,
So that the fire spread with awful rapidity,
And in twenty minutes the building was doomed to the fourth storey.
The firemen wrought with might and main,
But still the fire did on them gain,
That it was two hours before they could reach the second floor,
The heat being so intense they could scarcely it endure.
And inside all the time a woman and six children were there,
And when the firemen saw them, in amazement they did stare;
The sight that met their eyes made them for to start
Oh, Heaven! the sight was sufficient to rend the strongest heart.
For there was Mrs Brookes stretched dead on the floor,
Who had fallen in trying her escape for to procure.
She was lying with one arm over her ten months old child,
And her cries for help, no doubt, were frantic and wild;
And part of her arm was burned off as it lay above
The child she was trying to shield, which shows a mother's love.
For the baby's flesh was partly uninjured by the flames,
Which shows that the loving mother had endured great pains;
It, however, met its death by suffocation,
And as the spectators gazed thereon, it filled their hearts with consternation.
The firemen acted heroicallv, without any dread,
And when they entered the back premises they found the six children dead;
But Mr Brookes, 'tis said, is still alive,
And I hope for many years he will survive.
Oh, Heaven! it is cruel to perish by fire,
Therefore let us be watchful before to our beds we retire,
And see that everything is in safe order before we fall asleep,
And pray that God o'er us in the night watch will keep."
2035,Emotion,FirePoemsChimneyFirePoembyHerbertNehrlich,"Only forty more sleeps
and then Santa will come
with the bells and the beeps
and the presents for some.
Only good kids will get
what all good kids have earned
so there's no need to fret
where our tribe is concerned.
Now the stockings are swaying
near the chimney's old brick
and the snowflakes are playing
all in honour of Nick.
It is bedtime and after
but all riled are the boys
we can hear their sweet laughter
as they think about toys.
They've turned on  in a hurry
their  CB radios
will they work in the flurry
of the blizzard, who knows?
They were talking on air
to a deep and stern voice
and with all-knowing flair
over loud static noise,
were discussing details
as to when the big shipment
with the things it entails
thanks to proper equipment,
would arrive then to fill
all the stockings at last
when the room became still,
and young Greg yelled it fast:
' Hold your reindeers,  St. Nick
when you get here and use
it is equally quick
the front door, do not choose
our old chimney today
you will burn in the flames
and our stockings will sway
with no toys and no games.'
Now you know the tradition
of the stockings still works
and each year it's his mission
to stop by at those jerks
who with timber and coal
light their Christmas  Eve fire
from the distant North Pole
comes the man we admire,
and he slides with Ho Ho
down the chimney to bring
all the goodies we know
and his praises we sing.
But the sound  Ho Ho Ho
is a real good answer
it's an arctic air blow
as suggested by Prancer.
And no fire keeps going
to prevent bringing gifts
it is cold out and snowing
and they fly over drifts.
Merry Christmas to Santa
and to all living things
from the Pole to Atlanta
and for paupers and kings."

Fire hamper growth,
Fire is my illness,
Fire is sap my
Life force and wisdom.

And fire is also outside.
Fire is my own doubts,
My own uncertainty
And my own confusion.
Let me overtake my fire,
Let me fight with this fire
Within first."
2037,Emotion,FirePoemsOhDayOfFireAndSunPoembySaraTeasdale,"Oh day of fire and sun,
Pure as a naked flame,
Blue sea, blue sky and dun
Sands where he spoke my name;

That the spirit flew off free,
Lifting into the sky
Diving into the sea;
Oh day of fire and sun
Like a crystal burning,
Slow days go one by one,
But you have no returning."
2038,Emotion,FirePoemsAnOliveFirePoembyRobertWilliamService,"An olive fire's a lovely thing;
Somehow it makes me think of Spring
As in my grate it over-spills
With dancing flames like daffodils.
They flirt and frolic, twist and twine,
The brassy fire-irons wink and shine. . . .
Leap gold, you flamelets! Laugh and sing:
An olive fire's a lovely thing.
An olive fire's a household shrine:
A crusty loaf, a jug of wine,
An apple and a chunk of cheese -
Oh I could be content with these.
But if my curse of oil is there,
To fry a fresh-caught fish, I swear
I do not envy any king,
As sitting by my hearth I sing:
An olive fire's a lovely thing.
When old and worn, of life I tire,
I'll sit before an olive fire,
And watch the feather ash like snow
As softly as a rose heart glow;
The tawny roots will loose their hoard
Of sunbeams centuries have stored,
And flames like yellow chicken's cheep,
Till in my heart Peace is so deep:
With hands prayer-clasped I sleep . . . and sleep."

'fire with fire' is no answer
You need to sprinkle water
Get all the options to stop destruction
It shall put off immediately with timely prevention
It is mere an example
Faced by all people
Fire may be raging in our mind
But solution is only an answer to find
Not force with force
Or action with reaction
But response with calmness
And smile always on face
This can create different situation
Peace shall find its continuation
Love shall rule and hate shall disappear
People may have no fear
We are all human brings
And can bring
Situation to normal stage
This should be our motto and craze"
2044,Emotion,FirePoemsAFireSkyPoembyMarilynLott,"The sunset was like a fire-sky
That truly lit up my world
Clouds were orange and yellow
Like a paintbrush making swirls
The beauty was overwhelming
But a little bit frightening as well
It raged as though with fury
As it all began to swell
The colors were also reflected
In the lake where trees surround
It was quiet as I stood mesmerized
There was barely a single sound
I saw some fellows out fishing
Their bodies in semi-dark
Nothing looked quite real
The lake looked cold and stark
I doubt that I will ever see
A sunset just like this again
The entire sky so unimaginable
In a shocking kind of blend!"
2045,Emotion,FirePoemsFireAndSleetAndCandlelightPoembyElinorMortonWylie,"For this you've striven
Daring, to fail:
Your sky is riven
Like a tearing veil.
For this, you've wasted
Wings of your youth;
Divined, and tasted
Bitter springs of truth.
From sand unslakèd
Twisted strong cords,
And wandering naked
Among trysted swords.
There's a word unspoken,
A knot untied.
Whatever is broken
The earth may hide.
The road was jagged
Over sharp stones:
Your body's too ragged
To cover your bones.
The wind scatters
Tears upon dust;
Your soul's in tatters
Where the spears thrust."

and he scribbled on the wall.
'Tomorrow morning a prince comes
to take me away, a better world,
my little fire-fly you try to show me the way
and I see that real world from your faint light.
Thank you so much my dear

When the sun sets in the night
Red and yellow engulf the world
In a vivid and glorious sight
It’s seems so unexplainable
How the sky lights up this way
I can’t think of a more perfect
Way to end the day
Sometimes purple adds itself
To the colors up above
A fever in the sky it seems
Or God showing His thoughtful love
Whatever is the reason
We enjoy the sights so much
When the sun drops from the sky
And leaves its brilliant touch!"

Bright as day, yet, gives no light

Remove sin from Heavens sight
Fire, twist and taint the once pure light
Heaven fought against your might
In the end, He lost the fight
Pure souls surrender to the evil light
As shadows move to reign the night
Angel's wings flutter in fearful flight
In the shadow of your light
Fire, sweet and sin filled bane
Make the devil go insane
As you burn his skin with acid rain
His screams are songs wrought in pain
His wake of Hell’s dark fire wanes
Death and pain are what he gains
Shadows of the devil’s bane
Wash away his sin with His holy name
Fire of the dragon’s heart
Don’t let us tear the world apart"

in the immensity of the night, lighting my destiny.
Although, with the implacable passing of time,
the brightness of the fire of your lovely green eyes
became tinged with sadness, and the wild thing became fondness,
they still smile with sweetness every time they meet with mine.
My love, the wild fire of your pretty green eyes
still warms my heartbroken being in cold mornings,
when the morning nostalgia rides hopelessly,
looking for restless souls like mine.
My love, the wild fire of your beautiful green eyes,

the hidden fire of my sad, sad eyes,

2054,Emotion,FirePoemsACitysDeathByFirePoembyDerekWalcott,"After that hot gospeller has levelled all but the churched sky,
I wrote the tale by tallow of a city's death by fire;
Under a candle's eye, that smoked in tears, I
Wanted to tell, in more than wax, of faiths that were snapped like wire.
All day I walked abroad among the rubbled tales,
Shocked at each wall that stood on the street like a liar;
Loud was the bird-rocked sky, and all the clouds were bales
Torn open by looting, and white, in spite of the fire.
By the smoking sea, where Christ walked, I asked, why
Should a man wax tears, when his wooden world fails?
In town, leaves were paper, but the hills were a flock of faiths;
To a boy who walked all day, each leaf was a green breath
Rebuilding a love I thought was dead as nails,
Blessing the death and the baptism by fire."
2055,Emotion,FirePoemsAsKingfishersCatchFirePoembyGerardManleyHopkins,"As king fishers catch fire, dragonflies draw flame;
As tumbled over rim in roundy wells
Stones ring; like each tucked string tells, each hung bell's
Bow swung finds tongue to fling out broad its name;
Each mortal thing does one thing and the same:
Deals out that being indoors each one dwells;
Selves -- goes itself; myself it speaks and spells,
Crying What I do is me: for that I came.
I say more: the just man justices;
Keeps grace: that keeps all his goings graces;
Acts in God's eye what in God's eye he is --
Christ. For Christ plays in ten thousand places,
Lovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his
To the Father through the features of men's faces."

For we shall remember how to dream, it's like watching a
quite fire.
For a quite fire is like timeless echos in the winds.
A quite fire can soothe a lonely soul in passing.
quite is the fire.
A quite fire can take you over in a moment, it's magic,
A quite fire can burn deep with in your soul for hope,
for peace and for love.
Quite is the fire to hear a silent whisper and think of love.
Quite is the fire.

Quite is the time for passion
A quite fire is like timeless echos in the winds."

To my small Hearth His fire came—
And all my House aglow

2058,Emotion,FirePoemsArmiesInTheFirePoembyRobertLouisStevenson,"The lamps now glitter down the street;
Faintly sound the falling feet;
And the blue even slowly falls
About the garden trees and walls.
Now in the falling of the gloom
The red fire paints the empty room:
And warmly on the roof it looks,
And flickers on the back of books.
Armies march by tower and spire
Of cities blazing, in the fire;--
Till as I gaze with staring eyes,
The armies fall, the lustre dies.
Then once again the glow returns;
Again the phantom city burns;
And down the red-hot valley, lo!
The phantom armies marching go!
Blinking embers, tell me true
Where are those armies marching to,
And what the burning city is
That crumbles in your furnaces!"
2059,Emotion,FirePoemsTheSongOfTheCampFirePoembyRobertWilliamService,"Heed me, feed me, I am hungry, I am red-tongued with desire;
Boughs of balsam, slabs of cedar, gummy fagots of the pine,
Heap them on me, let me hug them to my eager heart of fire,
Roaring, soaring up to heaven as a symbol and a sign.
Bring me knots of sunny maple, silver birch and tamarack;
Leaping, sweeping, I will lap them with my ardent wings of flame;
I will kindle them to glory, I will beat the darkness back;
Streaming, gleaming, I will goad them to my glory and my fame.
Bring me gnarly limbs of live-oak, aid me in my frenzied fight;
Strips of iron-wood, scaly blue-gum, writhing redly in my hold;
With my lunge of lurid lances, with my whips that flail the night,
They will burgeon into beauty, they will foliate in gold.
Let me star the dim sierras, stab with light the inland seas;
Roaming wind and roaring darkness! seek no mercy at my hands;
I will mock the marly heavens, lamp the purple prairies,
I will flaunt my deathless banners down the far, unhouseled lands.
In the vast and vaulted pine-gloom where the pillared forests frown,
By the sullen, bestial rivers running where God only knows,
On the starlit coral beaches when the combers thunder down,
In the death-spell of the barrens, in the shudder of the snows;
In a blazing belt of triumph from the palm-leaf to the pine,
As a symbol of defiance lo! the wilderness I span;
And my beacons burn exultant as an everlasting sign
Of unending domination, of the mastery of Man;
I, the Life, the fierce Uplifter, I that weaned him from the mire;
I, the angel and the devil, I, the tyrant and the slave;
I, the Spirit of the Struggle; I, the mighty God of Fire;
I, the Maker and Destroyer; I, the Giver and the Grave.

Few are you, and far and lonely, yet an army forms behind:
By your camp-fires shall they know you, ashes scattered to the wind.
Peer into my heart of solace, break your bannock at my blaze;
Smoking, stretched in lazy shelter, build your castles as you gaze;
Or, it may be, deep in dreaming, think of dim, unhappy days.
Let my warmth and glow caress you, for your trails are grim and hard;
Let my arms of comfort press you, hunger-hewn and battle-scarred:
O my lovers! how I bless you with your lives so madly marred!
For you seek the silent spaces, and their secret lore you glean:
For you win the savage races, and the brutish Wild you wean;
And I gladden desert places, where camp-fire has never been.
From the Pole unto the Tropics is there trail ye have not dared?
And because you hold death lightly, so by death shall you be spared,
(As the sages of the ages in their pages have declared).
On the roaring Arkilinik in a leaky bark canoe;
Up the cloud of Mount McKinley, where the avalanche leaps through;
In the furnace of Death Valley, when the mirage glimmers blue.
Now a smudge of wiry willows on the weary Kuskoquim;
Now a flare of gummy pine-knots where Vancouver's scaur is grim;
Now a gleam of sunny ceiba, when the Cuban beaches dim.
Always, always God's Great Open: lo! I burn with keener light
In the corridors of silence, in the vestibules of night;
'Mid the ferns and grasses gleaming, was there ever gem so bright?
Not for weaklings, not for women, like my brother of the hearth;
Ring your songs of wrath around me, I was made for manful mirth,
In the lusty, gusty greatness, on the bald spots of the earth.
Men, my masters! men, my lovers! ye have fought and ye have bled;
Gather round my ruddy embers, softly glowing is my bed;
By my heart of solace dreaming, rest ye and be comforted!
III
I am dying, O my masters! by my fitful flame ye sleep;
My purple plumes of glory droop forlorn.
Grey ashes choke and cloak me, and above the pines there creep
The stealthy silver moccasins of morn.
There comes a countless army, it's the Legion of the Light;
It tramps in gleaming triumph round the world;
And before its jewelled lances all the shadows of the night
Back in to abysmal darknesses are hurled.
Leap to life again, my lovers! ye must toil and never tire;
The day of daring, doing, brightens clear,
When the bed of spicy cedar and the jovial camp-fire
Must only be a memory of cheer.
There is hope and golden promise in the vast portentous dawn;
There is glamour in the glad, effluent sky:
Go and leave me; I will dream of you and love you when you're gone;
I have served you, O my masters! let me die.
A little heap of ashes, grey and sodden by the rain,
Wind-scattered, blurred and blotted by the snow:
Let that be all to tell of me, and glorious again,
Ye things of greening gladness, leap and glow!
A black scar in the sunshine by the palm-leaf or the pine,
Blind to the night and dead to all desire;
Yet oh, of life and uplift what a symbol and a sign!
Yet oh, of power and conquest what a destiny is mine!
A little heap of ashes -- Yea! a miracle divine,
The foot-print of a god, all-radiant Fire."
2060,Emotion,FirePoemsFirePagesPoembyCarlSandburg,"I will read ashes for you, if you ask me.
I will look on the fire and tell you from the gray lashes
And out of the red and black tongues and stripes,
I will tell how fire comes
And how fire runs far as the sea."
2061,Emotion,FirePoemsBallOfFirePoembyErnestineNorthover,"Our Sun beats down, its rays so strong,
It heats this earth, where we belong,
Ripening to gold the waving corn,
Rising up high to start the morn.
Its sunshine pleasures all it greets,
And brightens so, our darkest streets.
With warmth it transforms a frosty day,
And bright beams sweep the gloom away.
Oh, ball of fire, shine radiant for me,
And all your famed glory, let me see.

2062,Emotion,FirePoemsFireLovePoembyPatriciaGale,"Golden orangish flames
Hinted with a hue of blue
Circling round hardened wood
Consuming the outer
Streaking through the grain
Down to its very core
Strange.. the comparison to love
How it begins with a spark
Then a glowing consuming feeling
Circling round the outer till it reaches the very core of the soul
As it streaks through the body then reaching the heart
Fire and love different as night is to day
But none the less….
Both consume and may warm a being
Or leave one with nothing but ashes"
2063,Emotion,FirePoemsFireIcePoembyAJMcKinley,"I am the creator who cannot find
The soul in which I burn
A witch of fire, frozen in ice
Freedom is a flight I yearn
Cold and numb, asleep
Yet my eyes are open wide
A cast of iron prison through which
My inner light resides
I yearn to be awakened.
My fire to melt this icy brocade
I yearn for reckless oblivion
My facade has been self-made
A river made of loneliness
My soul has been branded numb
A leave from absolute sadness
I seek the blue-eyed one"
2064,Emotion,FirePoemsLadyFirePoembyGeoffWarden,"'Tis a fine Lady..,
I was connected too
Her words of poetry
Cut me right through
'Tis the Lady I chance
Cross a very thin line
Her sway of romance
melts my frozen heart..
Somehow, someway I am drawn to verse
It pulls me closer
absorbing my very soul
consuming my very being
Strangers...
though her words taught my mind
with an unspeakable desire..
for her golden hand I wish to hold
She is the ink
I long to be the paper
Oh write your words of passion
Upon my needing heart........
A fine Lady full of passion
Fulfilling the needs of my want
Ink meets paper, my world a fire
She..the Lady...Fills my desire..
Such Princess of passionate dream
Golden hand upon my cheek
such sweet gentle touch
Makes my soul so speak....."
2065,Emotion,FirePoemsFirePoembyDorotheaMackeller,"This life that we call our own
Is neither strong nor free;
A flame in the wind of death,
It trembles ceaselessly.
And this all we can do
To use our little light
Before, in the piercing wind,
It flickers into night:
To yield the heat of the flame,
To grudge not, but to give
Whatever we have of strength,
That one more flame may live."
2066,Emotion,FirePoemsTheFireAtTranterSweatleysPoembyThomasHardy,"They had long met o' Zundays--her true love and she--
And at junketings, maypoles, and flings;
But she bode wi' a thirtover uncle, and he
Swore by noon and by night that her goodman should be
Naibor Sweatley--a gaffer oft weak at the knee
From taking o' sommat more cheerful than tea--
Who tranted, and moved people's things.
She cried, ""O pray pity me!"" Nought would he hear;
Then with wild rainy eyes she obeyed,
She chid when her Love was for clinking off wi' her.
The pa'son was told, as the season drew near
To throw over pu'pit the names of the peäir
As fitting one flesh to be made.
The wedding-day dawned and the morning drew on;
The couple stood bridegroom and bride;
The evening was passed, and when midnight had gone
The folks horned out, ""God save the King,"" and anon
The two home-along gloomily hied.
The lover Tim Tankens mourned heart-sick and drear
To be thus of his darling deprived:
He roamed in the dark ath'art field, mound, and mere,
And, a'most without knowing it, found himself near
The house of the tranter, and now of his Dear,
Where the lantern-light showed 'em arrived.
The bride sought her cham'er so calm and so pale
That a Northern had thought her resigned;
But to eyes that had seen her in tide-times of weal,
Like the white cloud o' smoke, the red battlefield's vail,
That look spak' of havoc behind.
The bridegroom yet laitered a beaker to drain,
Then reeled to the linhay for more,
When the candle-snoff kindled some chaff from his grain--
Flames spread, and red vlankers, wi' might and wi' main,
And round beams, thatch, and chimley-tun roar.
Young Tim away yond, rafted up by the light,
Through brimble and underwood tears,
Till he comes to the orchet, when crooping thereright
In the lewth of a codlin-tree, bivering wi' fright,
Wi' on'y her night-rail to screen her from sight,
His lonesome young Barbree appears.
Her cwold little figure half-naked he views
Played about by the frolicsome breeze,
Her light-tripping totties, her ten little tooes,
All bare and besprinkled wi' Fall's chilly dews,
While her great gallied eyes, through her hair hanging loose,
Sheened as stars through a tardle o' trees.
She eyed en; and, as when a weir-hatch is drawn,
Her tears, penned by terror afore,
With a rushing of sobs in a shower were strawn,
Till her power to pour 'em seemed wasted and gone
From the heft o' misfortune she bore.
""O Tim, my own Tim I must call 'ee--I will!
All the world ha' turned round on me so!
Can you help her who loved 'ee, though acting so ill?
Can you pity her misery--feel for her still?
When worse than her body so quivering and chill
Is her heart in its winter o' woe!
""I think I mid almost ha' borne it,"" she said,
""Had my griefs one by one come to hand;
But O, to be slave to thik husbird for bread,
And then, upon top o' that, driven to wed,
And then, upon top o' that, burnt out o' bed,
Is more than my nater can stand!""
Tim's soul like a lion 'ithin en outsprung--
(Tim had a great soul when his feelings were wrung)--
""Feel for 'ee, dear Barbree?"" he cried;
And his warm working-jacket about her he flung,
Made a back, horsed her up, till behind him she clung
Like a chiel on a gipsy, her figure uphung
By the sleeves that around her he tied.
Over piggeries, and mixens, and apples, and hay,
They lumpered straight into the night;
And finding bylong where a halter-path lay,
At dawn reached Tim's house, on'y seen on their way
By a naibor or two who were up wi' the day;
But they gathered no clue to the sight.
Then tender Tim Tankens he searched here and there
For some garment to clothe her fair skin;
But though he had breeches and waistcoats to spare,
He had nothing quite seemly for Barbree to wear,
Who, half shrammed to death, stood and cried on a chair
At the caddle she found herself in.
There was one thing to do, and that one thing he did,
He lent her some clouts of his own,
And she took 'em perforce; and while in 'em she slid,
Tim turned to the winder, as modesty bid,
Thinking, ""O that the picter my duty keeps hid
To the sight o' my eyes mid be shown!""
In the tallet he stowed her; there huddied she lay,
Shortening sleeves, legs, and tails to her limbs;
But most o' the time in a mortal bad way,
Well knowing that there'd be the divel to pay
If 'twere found that, instead o' the elements' prey,
She was living in lodgings at Tim's.
""Where's the tranter?"" said men and boys; ""where can er be?""
""Where's the tranter?"" said Barbree alone.
""Where on e'th is the tranter?"" said everybod-y:
They sifted the dust of his perished roof-tree,
And all they could find was a bone.
Then the uncle cried, ""Lord, pray have mercy on me!""
And in terror began to repent.
But before 'twas complete, and till sure she was free,
Barbree drew up her loft-ladder, tight turned her key--
Tim bringing up breakfast and dinner and tea--
Till the news of her hiding got vent.
Then followed the custom-kept rout, shout, and flare
Of a skimmington-ride through the naiborhood, ere
Folk had proof o' wold Sweatley's decay.
Whereupon decent people all stood in a stare,
Saying Tim and his lodger should risk it, and pair:
So he took her to church. An' some laughing lads there
Cried to Tim, ""After Sweatley!"" She said, ""I declare
I stand as a maiden to-day!"""
2067,Emotion,FirePoemsAirWaterFirePoembyLindaHepner,"The Milky Way was curled and curdled in the sky tonight
when on the shore I heard the waves crash down;
a thousand cats leaped miowling at the moon,
wolves howled at the wind
and in the forest a nightingale sang till dawn.
Mañana tocaran los guitaros
de mi corazón
y cantaran los vientos
and strangest drums will thrum
while Miriam will undulate and set her cymbals
trembling with prophesies, crying
Wa habibi, what has befallen you?
Oh where shall I find you?
I found you coming towards me….
Mi amor, my best beloved
come intertwine, unite and fling
your robes upon the sea shore
where waves will bear them to far islands,
your jewels will shoot like meteors into the oceans
and flying fish will leap out shooting to the heavens…
may all our passion reign in glorious confusion
while in the forest
a nightingale will sing one song till dawn.

2068,Emotion,FirePoemsHireAndFirePoembyChuckAudette,"some money I was desperately needing
gambling debts paid or I'd soon be bleeding
my bar was already deep in the red
'youse got insurance? ', the mob guy said
'dis dump you could combust
but get an alibi - dat is a must'
Hmm.. 'arsonist' ain't in the phone book -
so around my bar, I took a look
found some hot-headed guy with a thing for crime
but he couldn't start anything on time
He smelled like gas, dressed like a slob
Was always smoking on the job
he demanded up front, all of his cash
then sat around on his ash
always had his face in a cup
his work ethic just burned me up
five nights now with no ignite
I was smoldering mad, it just wasn't right
I finally had to re-cinder the deal
he wasn't a match for the job, I feel"
2069,Emotion,FirePoemsAGallopOfFirePoembyMarieEJPitt,"When the north wind moans thro' the blind creek courses
And revels with harsh, hot sand,
I loose the horses, the wild red horses,
I loose the horses, the mad, red horses,
And terror is on the land.
With prophetic murmer the hills are humming,
The forest-kings bend and blow;
With hoofs of brass on the baked earth strumming,
O brave red horses, they hear us coming,
And the legions of death lean low.
O'er the wooded height, and the sandy hollow
Where the boles to the axe have rung,
Tho' they fly the foreman as flies the swallow,
The fierce red horses, my horses, follow
With flanks to the faint earth flung.
Or with frenzied hieroglyphs, fear embossing
Night's sable horizon bars,
Thro' tangled mazes of death-darts crossing,
I swing my leaders and watch them tossing
Their red manes against the stars.
But when South winds sob in the drowned creek courses
And whisper to hard wet sand,
I hold the horses, the spent red horses,
I hold the horses, the tired red horses,
And silence is on the land.
Yea, the South wind sobs among the drowned creek courses
For sorrows no man shall bind---
Ah, God! For the horses, the black plumed horses,
Dear God! For the horses, Death's own pale horses,
That raced in the tracks behind."
2070,Emotion,FirePoemsTheStationFirePoembyChuckAudette,"late, on the way home
I saw the engines
the rescues and police
and wondered why
the Station Nightclub last night
a rock concert
with pyrotechnics naturally
all caught on video
as the walls and ceilings flamed
and an orderly exit
becomes desperate under the unreal advance of the flames
suddenly a panicked crush to escape
the darkening interior of hell
the heat and toxic smoke
I can't imagine
the helpless entrapment amongst tightly-packed bodies
immobile and hurt
feeling the flames coming closer
like a hungry demonic beast
dripping saliva of burning plastic
coming to devour its prey
screams of those being taken
hoping to be unconscious
to block out this nightmare
and when it came for me
to already be in a cool place

2071,Emotion,FirePoemsFireInTheHeavensPoembyChristopherJohnBrennan,"Fire in the heavens, and fire along the hills,
and fire made solid in the flinty stone,
thick-mass'd or scatter'd pebble, fire that fills
the breathless hour that lives in fire alone.
This valley, long ago the patient bed
of floods that carv'd its antient amplitude,
in stillness of the Egyptian crypt outspread,
endures to drown in noon-day's tyrant mood.
Behind the veil of burning silence bound,
vast life's innumerous busy littleness
is hush'd in vague-conjectured blur of sound
that dulls the brain with slumbrous weight, unless
some dazzling puncture let the stridence throng
in the cicada's torture-point of song."
2072,Emotion,FirePoemsFireBurnsFireBurnsPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"If you like you can enquire
There are rings of fire
There are hearts on fire
There are desert, grass and bush fires
Burning with a red hot rage on a different stage
They burn and mature that one can only admire
O! Fire O! Fire
My heart is on fire
Inside my soul a little flame has transpired
Have my words mis-fired while I speak of fire?
Fire burns like a scorching red-hot sun
And when fire burns its impact is sometimes no fun
Fire burns! Fire burns!
People die, people cry, people sigh
Fire run, run and run
Let's take turns to run before we turn into a bun
When you play with fire your hands will burn
When you lay with fire, heads will surely turn
Fire burns! Fire burns!
A hand pulls a gun and fires
A man goes to work and gets fired
And while I tire, I ask myself am I a liar?
For I speak of the uncontrollable forest fires
That cannot be announced by any town crier
A little spark
A brittle panic attack
A burning flame
A red-hot blaze
In seconds fire can take out an entire space
Fire burns! Fire burns!
And while the fire transpires
I can see the fire in your eyes
A hot passionate desire that flies and flies
And the fire burns and burns
Run, run and run for heads will turn
And the heat will rise like the scorching sun
Fire burns! Fire burns!
I ask silently for a ceasefire
For fire only ignites to inspire more misery
And out of that misery are born some high fliers
Run, run and run for heads will turn
And whatever burns can never be undone"
2073,Emotion,FirePoemsFireFlowersPoembyEmilyPaulineJohnson,"And only where the forest fires have sped,
Scorching relentlessly the cool north lands,
A sweet wild flower lifts its purple head,
And, like some gentle spirit sorrow-fed,
It hides the scars with almost human hands.
And only to the heart that knows of grief,
Of desolating fire, of human pain,
There comes some purifying sweet belief,
Some fellow-feeling beautiful, if brief.
And life revives, and blossoms once again"
2074,Emotion,FirePoemsEyesOfFireAndHeartOfStonePoembyMaryNagy,"I see pain in their eyes.
I hear sorrow in their cries.
Inside I break and cry alone,
with my eyes of fire and heart of stone.
No matter how much pain I feel
I am sure that I will always deal
the way I know..alone
with my eyes of fire and heart of stone.
Others may not know the fear.
They know just what they see or hear.
I come off cruel and cold.
Inside I'm not...I'm just not bold.
I have to thank my mother
for the love she's never shown
The one thing that she did give me...
her eyes of fire and heart of stone."
2075,Emotion,FirePoemsAFireTruckPoembyRichardWilbur,"Right down the shocked street with a
siren-blast
That sends all else skittering to the
curb,
Redness, brass, ladders and hats hurl
past,
Blurring to sheer verb,
Shift at the corner into uproarious gear
And make it around the turn in a squall
of traction,
The headlong bell maintaining sure and
clear,
Thought is degraded action!
Beautiful, heavy, unweary, loud,
obvious thing!
I stand here purged of nuance, my
mind a blank.
All I was brooding upon has taken
wing,
And I have you to thank.
As you howl beyond hearing I carry you
into my mind,
Ladders and brass and all, there to
admire
Your phoenix-red simplicity, enshrined
In that not extinguished fire.

2076,Emotion,FirePoemsFirePoembyAdamZagajewski,"Probably I am an ordinary middle-class
believer in individual rights, the word
""freedom"" is simple to me, it doesn't mean
the freedom of any class in particular.
Politically naive, with an average
education (brief moments of clear vision
are its main nourishment), I remember
the blazing appeal of that fire which parches
the lips of the thirsty crowd and burns
books and chars the skin of cities. I used to sing
those songs and I know how great it is
to run with others; later, by myself,
with the taste of ashes in my mouth, I heard
the lie's ironic voice and the choir screaming
and when I touched my head I could feel
the arched skull of my country, its hard edge.

2077,Emotion,FirePoemsFireFireFirePoembyNoelHorlanda,"Pyro, Fuego, Fire,
It’s a power, a strength,
A source of light,
Luminescent as solar energy,
Incandescent as moonbeams,
Luminosity of stars
Effulgence of blue heavens
It kindles, ignites vivid minds,
Imaginations, carnival brilliance,
Illuminates the world, the universe,
In the beginning a friend,
It leads, guides your way,
Makes you  warm, live, survive, yet
In the end, if abuse, left alone,
Becomes a monster, a destroyer,
Murderer, a spoiler it is,
Instill fear in you, the phobia overrule us,
Soon the cosmos, the macrocosm,
Solar, lunar, mankind to ashes,
Lustrous existence gone,
All in darkness, inky black
Empty space, serenity, tranquility but then,
The essence is nothing without -
Fire! Fire! Fire!"

O! chorus of fire,
That will burst from God’s choir,
When the loud hallelujahs leap up from the soul,
Till the flowers on the hills,
And the waves in the rills,
Shall tremble with joy in the music’s deep roll.
O! host without number, awaked from death’s slumber,
Who walk in white robes on the emerald shore;
The glory is o’er you, the throne is before you,
And weeping will come to your spirits no more.

O! mansions eternal, in fields ever vernal,
Awaiting your tenantry ransomed from sin,
We’ll stand on your pavement, no more in enslavement,
With home-songs to Jesus Who welcomes us in.

These weary life pulses that bring us to Thee,
Till, past the dark portal, we stand up immortal,
And sweep with hosannas the jasper lit sea.

An amorous coale with hot desire
Leapt on her breast, but could not melt

For shame it blusht; and then it died
There where resistance did abide,
And lest she should take it unkind
Repentant ashes left behind."
2080,Emotion,FirePoemsByTheFireSidePoembyRobertBrowning,"I.
How well I know what I mean to do
When the long dark autumn-evenings come:
And where, my soul, is thy pleasant hue?
With the music of all thy voices, dumb
In life's November too!
II.
I shall be found by the fire, suppose,
O'er a great wise book as beseemeth age,
While the shutters flap as the cross-wind blows
And I turn the page, and I turn the page,
Not verse now, only prose!
III.
Till the young ones whisper, finger on lip,
``There he is at it, deep in Greek:
``Now then, or never, out we slip
``To cut from the hazels by the creek
``A mainmast for our ship!''
IV.
I shall be at it indeed, my friends:
Greek puts already on either side
Such a branch-work forth as soon extends
To a vista opening far and wide,
And I pass out where it ends.
V.
The outside-frame, like your hazel-trees:
But the inside-archway widens fast,
And a rarer sort succeeds to these,
And we slope to Italy at last
And youth, by green degrees.
VI.
I follow wherever I am led,
Knowing so well the leader's hand:
Oh woman-country, wooed not wed,
Loved all the more by earth's male-lands,
Laid to their hearts instead!
VII.
Look at the ruined chapel again
Half-way up in the Alpine gorge!
Is that a tower, I point you plain,
Or is it a mill, or an iron-forge
Breaks solitude in vain?
VIII.
A turn, and we stand in the heart of things:
The woods are round us, heaped and dim;
From slab to slab how it slips and springs,
The thread of water single and slim,
Through the ravage some torrent brings!
IX.
Does it feed the little lake below?
That speck of white just on its marge
Is Pella; see, in the evening-glow,
How sharp the silver spear-heads charge
When Alp meets heaven in snow!
X.
On our other side is the straight-up rock;
And a path is kept 'twixt the gorge and it
By boulder-stones where lichens mock
The marks on a moth, and small ferns fit
Their teeth to the polished block.
XI.
Oh the sense of the yellow mountain-flowers,
And thorny balls, each three in one,
The chestnuts throw on our path in showers!
For the drop of the woodland fruit's begun,
These early November hours,
XII.
That crimson the creeper's leaf across
Like a splash of blood, intense, abrupt,
O'er a shield else gold from rim to boss,
And lay it for show on the fairy-cupped
Elf-needled mat of moss,
XIII.
By the rose-flesh mushrooms, undivulged
Last evening---nay, in to-day's first dew
Yon sudden coral nipple bulged,
Where a freaked fawn-coloured flaky crew
Of toadstools peep indulged.
XIV.
And yonder, at foot of the fronting ridge
That takes the turn to a range beyond,
Is the chapel reached by the one-arched bridge
Where the water is stopped in a stagnant pond
Danced over by the midge.
XV.
The chapel and bridge are of stone alike,
Blackish-grey and mostly wet;
Cut hemp-stalks steep in the narrow dyke.
See here again, how the lichens fret
And the roots of the ivy strike!
XVI.
Poor little place, where its one priest comes
On a festa-day, if he comes at all,
To the dozen folk from their scattered homes,
Gathered within that precinct small
By the dozen ways one roams---
XVII.
To drop from the charcoal-burners' huts,
Or climb from the hemp-dressers' low shed,
Leave the grange where the woodman stores his nuts,
Or the wattled cote where the fowlers spread
Their gear on the rock's bare juts.
XVIII.
It has some pretension too, this front,
With its bit of fresco half-moon-wise
Set over the porch, Art's early wont:
'Tis John in the Desert, I surmise,
But has borne the weather's brunt---
XIX.
Not from the fault of the builder, though,
For a pent-house properly projects
Where three carved beams make a certain show,
Dating---good thought of our architect's---
'Five, six, nine, he lets you know.
XX.
And all day long a bird sings there,
And a stray sheep drinks at the pond at times;
The place is silent and aware;
It has had its scenes, its joys and crimes,
But that is its own affair.
XXI.
My perfect wife, my Leonor,
Oh heart, my own, oh eyes, mine too,
Whom else could I dare look backward for,
With whom beside should I dare pursue
The path grey heads abhor?
XXII.
For it leads to a crag's sheer edge with them;
Youth, flowery all the way, there stops---
Not they; age threatens and they contemn,
Till they reach the gulf wherein youth drops,
One inch from life's safe hem!
XXIII.
With me, youth led ... I will speak now,
No longer watch you as you sit
Reading by fire-light, that great brow
And the spirit-small hand propping it,
Mutely, my heart knows how---
XXIV.
When, if I think but deep enough,
You are wont to answer, prompt as rhyme;
And you, too, find without rebuff
Response your soul seeks many a time
Piercing its fine flesh-stuff.
XXV.
My own, confirm me! If I tread
This path back, is it not in pride
To think how little I dreamed it led
To an age so blest that, by its side,
Youth seems the waste instead?
XXVI.
My own, see where the years conduct!
At first, 'twas something our two souls
Should mix as mists do; each is sucked
In each now: on, the new stream rolls,
Whatever rocks obstruct.
XXVII.
Think, when our one soul understands
The great Word which makes all things new,
When earth breaks up and heaven expands,
How will the change strike me and you
ln the house not made with hands?
XXVIII.
Oh I must feel your brain prompt mine,
Your heart anticipate my heart,
You must be just before, in fine,
See and make me see, for your part,
New depths of the divine!
XXIX.
But who could have expected this
When we two drew together first
Just for the obvious human bliss,
To satisfy life's daily thirst
With a thing men seldom miss?
XXX.
Come back with me to the first of all,
Let us lean and love it over again,
Let us now forget and now recall,
Break the rosary in a pearly rain,
And gather what we let fall!
XXXI.
What did I say?---that a small bird sings
All day long, save when a brown pair
Of hawks from the wood float with wide wings
Strained to a bell: 'gainst noon-day glare
You count the streaks and rings.
XXXII.
But at afternoon or almost eve
'Tis better; then the silence grows
To that degree, you half believe
It must get rid of what it knows,
Its bosom does so heave.
XXXIII.
Hither we walked then, side by side,
Arm in arm and cheek to cheek,
And still I questioned or replied,
While my heart, convulsed to really speak,
Lay choking in its pride.
XXXIV.
Silent the crumbling bridge we cross,
And pity and praise the chapel sweet,
And care about the fresco's loss,
And wish for our souls a like retreat,
And wonder at the moss.
XXXV.
Stoop and kneel on the settle under,
Look through the window's grated square:
Nothing to see! For fear of plunder,
The cross is down and the altar bare,
As if thieves don't fear thunder.
XXXVI.
We stoop and look in through the grate,
See the little porch and rustic door,
Read duly the dead builder's date;
Then cross the bridge that we crossed before,
Take the path again---but wait!
XXXVII.
Oh moment, one and infinite!
The water slips o'er stock and stone;
The West is tender, hardly bright:
How grey at once is the evening grown---
One star, its chrysolite!
XXXVIII.
We two stood there with never a third,
But each by each, as each knew well:
The sights we saw and the sounds we heard,
The lights and the shades made up a spell
Till the trouble grew and stirred.
XXXIX.
Oh, the little more, and how much it is!
And the little less, and what worlds away!
How a sound shall quicken content to bliss,
Or a breath suspend the blood's best play,
And life be a proof of this!
XL.
Had she willed it, still had stood the screen
So slight, so sure, 'twixt my love and her:
I could fix her face with a guard between,
And find her soul as when friends confer,
Friends---lovers that might have been.
XLI.
For my heart had a touch of the woodland-time,
Wanting to sleep now over its best.
Shake the whole tree in the summer-prime,
But bring to the Iast leaf no such test!
``Hold the last fast!'' runs the rhyme.
XLII.
For a chance to make your little much,
To gain a lover and lose a friend,
Venture the tree and a myriad such,
When nothing you mar but the year can mend:
But a last leaf---fear to touch!
XLIII.
Yet should it unfasten itself and fall
Eddying down till it find your face
At some slight wind---best chance of all!
Be your heart henceforth its dwelling-place
You trembled to forestall!
XLIV.
Worth how well, those dark grey eyes,
That hair so dark and dear, how worth
That a man should strive and agonize,
And taste a veriest hell on earth
For the hope of such a prize!
XIIV.
You might have turned and tried a man,
Set him a space to weary and wear,
And prove which suited more your plan,
His best of hope or his worst despair,
Yet end as he began.
XLVI.
But you spared me this, like the heart you are,
And filled my empty heart at a word.
If two lives join, there is oft a scar,
They are one and one, with a shadowy third;
One near one is too far.
XLVII.
A moment after, and hands unseen
Were hanging the night around us fast
But we knew that a bar was broken between
Life and life: we were mixed at last
In spite of the mortal screen.
XLVIII.
The forests had done it; there they stood;
We caught for a moment the powers at play:
They had mingled us so, for once and good,
Their work was done---we might go or stay,
They relapsed to their ancient mood.
XLIX.
How the world is made for each of us!
How all we perceive and know in it
Tends to some moment's product thus,
When a soul declares itself---to wit,
By its fruit, the thing it does
L.
Be hate that fruit or love that fruit,
It forwards the general deed of man,
And each of the Many helps to recruit
The life of the race by a general plan;
Each living his own, to boot.
LI.
I am named and known by that moment's feat;
There took my station and degree;
So grew my own small life complete,
As nature obtained her best of me---
One born to love you, sweet!
LII.
And to watch you sink by the fire-side now
Back again, as you mutely sit
Musing by fire-light, that great brow
And the spirit-small hand propping it,
Yonder, my heart knows how!
LIII.
So, earth has gained by one man the more,
And the gain of earth must be heaven's gain too;
And the whole is well worth thinking o'er
When autumn comes: which I mean to do
One day, as I said before."
2081,Emotion,FirePoemsATrueAccountOfTalkingToTheSunOnFireIslandPoembyFrankOHara,"The Sun woke me this morning loud
and clear, saying ""Hey! I've been
trying to wake you up for fifteen
minutes. Don't be so rude, you are
only the second poet I've ever chosen
to speak to personally
so why
aren't you more attentive? If I could
burn you through the window I would
to wake you up. I can't hang around
here all day.""
""Sorry, Sun, I stayed
up late last night talking to Hal.""
""When I woke up Mayakovsky he was
a lot more prompt"" the Sun said
petulantly. ""Most people are up
already waiting to see if I'm going
to put in an appearance.""
I tried
to apologize ""I missed you yesterday.""
""That's better"" he said. ""I didn't
know you'd come out."" ""You may be
wondering why I've come so close?""
""Yes"" I said beginning to feel hot
wondering if maybe he wasn't burning me
anyway.
""Frankly I wanted to tell you
I like your poetry. I see a lot
on my rounds and you're okay. You may
not be the greatest thing on earth, but
you're different. Now, I've heard some
say you're crazy, they being excessively
calm themselves to my mind, and other
crazy poets think that you're a boring
reactionary. Not me.
Just keep on
like I do and pay no attention. You'll
find that people always will complain
about the atmosphere, either too hot
or too cold too bright or too dark, days
too short or too long.
If you don't appear
at all one day they think you're lazy
or dead. Just keep right on, I like it.
And don't worry about your lineage
poetic or natural. The Sun shines on
the jungle, you know, on the tundra
the sea, the ghetto. Wherever you were
I knew it and saw you moving. I was waiting
for you to get to work.
And now that you
are making your own days, so to speak,
even if no one reads you but me
you won't be depressed. Not
everyone can look up, even at me. It
hurts their eyes.""
""Oh Sun, I'm so grateful to you!""
""Thanks and remember I'm watching. It's
easier for me to speak to you out
here. I don't have to slide down
between buildings to get your ear.
I know you love Manhattan, but
you ought to look up more often.
And
always embrace things, people earth
sky stars, as I do, freely and with
the appropriate sense of space. That
is your inclination, known in the heavens
and you should follow it to hell, if
necessary, which I doubt.
Maybe we'll
speak again in Africa, of which I too
am specially fond. Go back to sleep now
Frank, and I may leave a tiny poem
in that brain of yours as my farewell.""
""Sun, don't go!"" I was awake
at last. ""No, go I must, they're calling
me.""
""Who are they?""
Rising he said ""Some
day you'll know. They're calling to you
too."" Darkly he rose, and then I slept."
2082,Emotion,FirePoemsSonnet45TheOtherTwoSlightAirAndPurgingFirePoembyWilliamShakespeare,"The other two, slight air and purging fire,
Are both with thee, wherever I abide;
The first my thought, the other my desire,
These present-absent with swift motion slide.
For when these quicker elements are gone
In tender embassy of love to thee,
My life, being made of four, with two alone
Sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy;
Until life's composition be recured
By those swift messengers returned from thee,
Who even but now come back again, assured
Of thy fair health, recounting it to me.
This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,
I send them back again and straight grow sad."
2083,Emotion,FirePoemsFireWorksPoembyJamieParker,"Whizzing and banging
The Fire Roars
All the people come out...of there little doors
They watch the fountains much ablaze
This is such a very good display
but now it's time for bed
all snug and warm
But the fires still going
At the crack of dawn"
2084,Emotion,FirePoemsTheNightFirePoembyClaudeMcKay,"No engines shrieking rescue storm the night,
And hose and hydrant cannot here avail;
The flames laugh high and fling their challenging light,
And clouds turn gray and black from silver-pale.
The fire leaps out and licks the ancient walls,
And the big building bends and twists and groans.
A bar drops from its place; a rafter falls
Burning the flowers. The wind in frenzy moans.
The watchers gaze, held wondering by the fire,
The dwellers cry their sorrow to the crowd,
The flames beyond themselves rise higher, higher,
To lose their glory in the frowning cloud,
Yielding at length the last reluctant breath.
And where life lay asleep broods darkly death."
2085,Emotion,FirePoemsFireOnTheRidgePoembyMaryHavran,"In the west there is fearsome fire in the hills.
Full of dread, the people watch as flames burn upon the ridge.
Fierce winds fan the fury where the fires singe.
Meanwhile there’s hot air blasting forth from high upon the hill,
Pointless wind aimed at stirring some futile acts of men.
Strong winds fan the flames.
Embers ignite the blaze again.
While homes are lost across the land,
A burning night gives way to the dawn of restless men.
Rhetoric fails to charm while flames move across the land.
Fires burn readily across dry mountaintops.
Drought’s danger seeps down the slopes.
Now the valley too is brown and the pastures parched.
Wherever stray embers fall, fires will catch and burn
Until nowhere can they be stopped.
Will anything escape the flames fanned by these raging relentless winds?
The firemen grow weary,
They know neither sleep nor rest.
All their wisdom and efforts fail to meet the fires growing test.
They seek the help of younger men to aid them in the night,
But none can hear or heed the call; they are ensnared in some other fight.
The chief in command stands out of touch safe on the distant hill.
Insulated from the desperate fight, no fires will he end.
People in the valley see him perched emotionless and still.
If he even has a plan from this distance they can’t tell.
They fear for the safety of those who fight and for their own as well.
They fear the loss of all they love and treasure beyond price.
The fields once waved golden and valleys were lush with finest fruits.
The harvest, which they toiled toward, is in peril of being lost.
Will fires claim the victory and devour all they cherish?
Or will they rise against the blaze, fighting fire with fire, before they perish?
Through night a western ridge stays lit, while across this land no one dare now rest."
2086,Emotion,FirePoemsFireYourDesirePoembyObasuyiUyiosaDickson,"Since the day that the lord set me on fire
i have had a desire to acquire the knowledge of my messiah,
Whatever u desire, Dont retire
Aspire to Acquire the desire u admire
If u perspire
u wont retire.
When the enemies conspire to fire your desire,
dont tire,
remember your mesiah
the one who speaks fire
He has clothed you with his attire,
and has given you his entire empire,
that if you refire you will acquire,
this is not time to expire,
With Jesus your mesiah,
the devil's fire will backfire,
Desire the holyfire,
Become a carrier of the holyghost fire,
Our God the unmpire will never retire
He will always refire, he will never expire,
he will always inquire
his power is forever,
So u have all u require my friend,
to acquire your long admired desire,
this is all u require,
stay on fire.

2089,Emotion,FirePoemsTheFireOfDriftWoodPoembyHenryWadsworthLongfellow,"DEVEREUX FARM, NEAR MARBLEHEAD.
We sat within the farm-house old,
Whose windows, looking o'er the bay,
Gave to the sea-breeze damp and cold,
An easy entrance, night and day.
Not far away we saw the port,
The strange, old-fashioned, silent town,
The lighthouse, the dismantled fort,
The wooden houses, quaint and brown.
We sat and talked until the night,
Descending, filled the little room;
Our faces faded from the sight,
Our voices only broke the gloom.
We spake of many a vanished scene,
Of what we once had thought and said,
Of what had been, and might have been,
And who was changed, and who was dead;
And all that fills the hearts of friends,
When first they feel, with secret pain,
Their lives thenceforth have separate ends,
And never can be one again;
The first slight swerving of the heart,
That words are powerless to express,
And leave it still unsaid in part,
Or say it in too great excess.
The very tones in which we spake
Had something strange, I could but mark;
The leaves of memory seemed to make
A mournful rustling in the dark.
Oft died the words upon our lips,
As suddenly, from out the fire
Built of the wreck of stranded ships,
The flames would leap and then expire.
And, as their splendor flashed and failed,
We thought of wrecks upon the main,
Of ships dismasted, that were hailed
And sent no answer back again.
The windows, rattling in their frames,
The ocean, roaring up the beach,
The gusty blast, the bickering flames,
All mingled vaguely in our speech;
Until they made themselves a part
Of fancies floating through the brain,
The long-lost ventures of the heart,
That send no answers back again.
O flames that glowed! O hearts that yearned!
They were indeed too much akin,
The drift-wood fire without that burned,
The thoughts that burned and glowed within."
2090,Emotion,FirePoemsFirePoembySandraOsborne,"The flame crackles,
Spitting shinning sparks
And ashes and fire
Into the warming air.
It’s always fighting,
It’s Always changing,
Seems always so close
To life.
To it’s burning,
But beyond it’s brilliance
The fire defies, denies
And defeats it’s death.
Patience, I believe,
Is learned in the view.
Because with strength and defiance,
The coals burn anew."
2091,Emotion,AlonePoemsIAmMuchTooAloneInThisWorldYetNotAlonePoembyRainerMariaRilke,"I am much too alone in this world, yet not alone
enough
to truly consecrate the hour.
I am much too small in this world, yet not small
enough
to be to you just object and thing,
dark and smart.
I want my free will and want it accompanying
the path which leads to action;
and want during times that beg questions,
where something is up,
to be among those in the know,
or else be alone.
I want to mirror your image to its fullest perfection,
never be blind or too old
to uphold your weighty wavering reflection.
I want to unfold.
Nowhere I wish to stay crooked, bent;
for there I would be dishonest, untrue.
I want my conscience to be
true before you;
want to describe myself like a picture I observed
for a long time, one close up,
like a new word I learned and embraced,
like the everday jug,
like my mother's face,
like a ship that carried me along
through the deadliest storm."
2092,Emotion,AlonePoemsAlonePoembymacaulayakinbami,"Alone in the world of writs
I stand alone
To mockery because my shoes are worn,
My suit torn.
Alone,
Because I refused to invest my time
In vanity of men’s wealth
The relentless treadmill of materialism.
The infinity of human thoughts are vital to me
While friends and colleagues
Constant in the mad rush for avarice
Alone,
When I speak against societal ills
Paid writers mock at me
And call me ‘fool’!
My mind, preaching constant messages of irrelevances
Because I will die a writer.
No money,
No friends,
No foe.
Alone,
When intelligent comrades backslide
into a reverse and praising of societal tyranny.
Alone,
When vanity of fame and temporal gain
Reduce men of honour
To a  loose dissolved state of lies.
Alone,
When the courage for truth
Falls to a beggarly withdrawal for fear
Alone,
When mass comrades reduce intelligence
To cheap Trade by Bata.
Alone,
When moneybags employ friends
In the service of sly.
Alone,
When kings and kingdom
Turn greater minds to lesser scribe.
Alone,
When hunger, pain, loneliness
Stare in the face
For uncommon stance.
Alone,
Let lies increase
Vanity multiply
Comrades compromise
Hunger kill
Clothes burnt
Impoverished me be
With no friends
No follower
And in the grave
Just like I came,
Alone, Alone."

2094,Emotion,AlonePoemsFromphantasmionOneFaceAlonePoembySaraColeridge,"ONE face alone, one face alone,
These eyes require;
But, when that long’d-for sight is shown,
What fatal fire
Shoots through my veins a keen and liquid flame,
That melts each fibre of my wasting frame!
One voice alone, one voice alone,
I pine to hear;
But, when its meek mellifluous tone
Usurps mine ear,
Those slavish chains about my soul are wound,
Which ne’er, till death itself, can be unbound.
One gentle hand, one gentle hand,
I fain would hold;
But, when it seems at my command,
My own grows cold;
Then low to earth I bend in sickly swoon,
Like lilies drooping ’mid the blaze of noon."
2095,Emotion,AlonePoemsAlonePoembyMariannGentile,"Day by day, I wake alone, in a cold and empty bed,
Day by day, thoughts of you, keep running through my head.
I wake and wish this day would be the one I see your smile
I sit and wait to see your face, I'm living in denial.
Because I know that there's no way that I'll see you today,
And as the sun begins to set, my hopes will slip away.
As darkness covers this cruel world, my heart grows darker too,
And I will whisper to the night how much I long for you.
The stars begin to twinkle, lighting up the sky above,
But the only light I long to see is the light of your love.
I pray tomorrow is that day that I'm holding you tight,
As in my cold and empty bed, I stare alone into the night."
2096,Emotion,AlonePoemsADebtorToMercyAlonePoembyAugustusMontagueToplady,"A debtor to mercy alone, of covenant mercy I sing;
Nor fear, with Thy righteousness on, my person and off’ring to bring.
The terrors of law and of God with me can have nothing to do;
My Savior’s obedience and blood hide all my transgressions from view.
The work which His goodness began, the arm of His strength will complete;
His promise is Yea and Amen, and never was forfeited yet.
Things future, nor things that are now, nor all things below or above,
Can make Him His purpose forgo, or sever my soul from His love.
My name from the palms of His hands eternity will not erase;
Impressed on His heart it remains, in marks of indelible grace.
Yes, I to the end shall endure, as sure as the earnest is giv’n;
More happy, but not more secure, the glorified spirits in heav’n."
2097,Emotion,AlonePoemsSonnetXiYouNotAlonePoembyMichaelDrayton,"You not alone, when you are still alone,
O God, from you that I could private be.
Since you one were, I never since was one;
Since you in me, my self since out of me,
Transported from my self into your being;
Though either distant, present yet to either,
Senseless with too much joy, each other seeing,
And only absent when we are together.
Give me my self and take your self again,
Devise some means but how I may forsake you;
So much is mine that doth with you remain,
That, taking what is mine, with me I take you;
You do bewitch me; O, that I could fly
From my self you, or from your own self I."
2098,Emotion,AlonePoemsAloneInTheWindOnThePrairiePoembyVachelLindsay,"I know a seraph who has golden eyes,
And hair of gold, and body like the snow.
Here in the wind I dream her unbound hair
Is blowing round me, that desire's sweet glow
Has touched her pale keen face, and willful mien.
And though she steps as one in manner born
To tread the forests of fair Paradise,
Dark memory's wood she chooses to adorn.
Here with bowed head, bashful with half-desire
She glides into my yesterday's deep dream,
All glowing by the misty ferny cliff
Beside the far forbidden thundering stream.
Within my dream I shake with the old flood.
I fear its going, ere the spring days go.
Yet pray the glory may have deathless years,
And kiss her hair, and sweet throat like the snow."
2099,Emotion,AlonePoemsAlonePoembyWalterdelaMare,"The abode of the nightingale is bare,
Flowered frost congeals in the gelid air,
The fox howls from his frozen lair:
Alas, my loved one is gone,
I am alone:
It is winter.
Once the pink cast a winy smell,
The wild bee hung in the hyacinth bell,
Light in effulgence of beauty fell:
I am alone:
It is winter.
My candle a silent fire doth shed,
Starry Orion hunts o'erhead;
Come moth, come shadow, the world is dead:
Alas, my loved one is gone,
I am alone;
It is winter."

When I walk alone, I walk with broken heart
When I walk alone, I walk with sadness
When I walk alone, I walk with my silent tears
When I walk alone, I walk with my sorrow
When I walk alone, I walk with my sad memories
When I walk alone, I walk with my shattered dream
When I walk alone, I walk with my hands lifeless
Love never walk alone but you made me walk alone
You promised me that you will walk with me forever
but you made me walk alone with my tears forever
When the heaven stolen you from me yesterday
All your promises are gone with the wind
Today, You made me walk alone with out you my love
and I promise you, I will walk alone till my journey ends"
2101,Emotion,AlonePoemsAlonePoembyMoonbeam,"What is the difference in being all alone over here by my self
Or all alone over there with people who don’t care
And could careless if I was there with them
Watching
Waiting
Not being spoken too
Waiting for the right moment to speak
Sneak a peak of what its like on the inside
I am all alone where ever I go
Whether I am alone in a room full of people
Or an empty field all by my self
I feel the feeling of wanting
Need and striving to be with you
With someone
Anyone at all
But I can’t
I am all ways alone
In the cold
On my own
Whether it be in a crowed room
Or in a field all of my own
I am all alone
What is the true difference between being alone on my own
Or with people who don’t care
It doesn’t matter anyways
Why make a false invite and
Try to be polite
When you just turn me away
I am alone whether it be in a room crowded with people
Or alone in an empty field
With no one around to hear me scream and bleed and cry
What really is the difference between
Being alone with a crowd of people who don’t care
And being all alone over there.
Alone on a bench to cry"
2102,Emotion,AlonePoemsAHeartBreaksEasierAlonePoembyWalterKrijthe,"A heart breaks easier alone
When no one sees you crying
When no one notices at all
That inside you are dying
A heart breaks easier alone
When they all think you're crazy
That when you crawl back in your bed
The whole world thinks you're lazy
A heart breaks easier alone
And there's no way to mend it
To stop the heart from breaking more
You simply have to end it
A heart breaks easier alone
Without a love to heal it
And finally the breaking's done
When you no longer feel it"

Until I die my breath will guard you,
And my memories after.
In my death none I like to weep for me,

To love you to guard you to serve you.
I am born to love you alone
And I will die for your love too.
In the world here after, I will love, love you alone.
What else shall I say when my love for you is full?
What shall I think but you  when you are the truth.
I will but love you, Let them stone at me.
You alone I love, you alone I worship.
I m made to sing your melodies, care not the world hear or not.

2105,Emotion,AlonePoemsAndIWasAlonePoembyAJMcKinley,"And I was alone with my thoughts.
Memories swirl in a unison of faith.
Change has been inevitably declined.
Passion bleeds from walls glittered gold.
And I was alone with my thoughts.
Recipe for destruction gilded on the page.
A gift purely given like forgotten trash.
Forever has no distinction beyond now.
And I was alone with my thoughts.
Authority is a prodigy of laziness.
Wealth measured by free-flowing barriers.
Sensuality is a brand no longer tangible.
And I was alone with my thoughts.
Swinging on a broken rope of promise.
The puddle is full of cracks.
Feminine impression embedded on the seat.
And I was alone with my thoughts.
Glistening prisms of a generation forgotten.
Barriers instilled on a broken mirror.
Reflections stagnant with happenstance.
And I was alone.

2106,Emotion,AlonePoemsZzzzzAlonePoembyPdishere,"Will a friend fly here
Among the gulls that glide and cry,
And erase all the mortification
Just to end this life's taxation?
Will a friend float here
Among the waves that rise and fall,
And break upon the rocks
To shatter lies that stand tall?
Will a friend walk here
Among the numerous passerbys
And fight for my rights
On all the days and nights?
Will a friend swim here
Among the sharks that create terror and fear
With strength and courage
Just to save my jagged life?
Or will I sit and sob
Among the winds that swirl and twirl
Only to unfurl
A life with beauty all around
But no human support to surround.
Does that mean all I can do is moan and groan
And nevertheless be on my own - ALL ALONE?

Wherever I go it's my path so I'll pick it'
Sitting here alone, by the windowsill
But the air is bored, it must be filled
One comes in, then comes three
They have all come to join me
But I was happy didn't own a bored bone
I was happy when I was alone"
2108,Emotion,AlonePoemsCallMeWhenYouAreAlonePoembyRaviSathasivam,"Call me, when you are alone
You know your voice will make my day
You know how much I wait to hear your voice
You know how much I feel for you
You know you can shun my loneliness
You know I listen to you through my tears
You know my tears brings joy to me
You know my heart has grown big
You know your heart is pressed with me
You know I have so many wishes in my heart
You know I am sitting here and thinking how to start
You know I want to send my hugs to you
You know I love you forever in so many ways
call me again and again when you are lone"
2109,Emotion,AlonePoemsHelenAllAlonePoembyRudyardKipling,"There was darkness under Heaven
For an hour's space--
Darkness that we knew was given
Us for special grace.
Sun and noon and stars were hid,
God had left His Throne,
When Helen came to me, she did,
Helen all alone!
Side by side (because our fate
Damned us ere our birth)
We stole out of Limbo Gate
Looking for the Earth.
Hand in pulling hand amid
Fear no dreams have known,
Helen ran with me, she did,
Helen all alone!
When the Horror passing speech
Hunted us along,
Each laid hold on each, and each
Found the other strong.
In the teeth of Things forbid
And Reason overthrown,
Helen stood by me, she did,
Helen all alone!
When, at last, we heard those Fires
Dull and die away,
When, at last, our linked desires
Dragged us up to day;
When, at last, our souls were rid
Of what that Night had shown,
Helen passed from me, she did,
Helen all alone!
Let her go and find a mate,
As I will find a bride,
Knowing naught of Limbo Gate
Or Who are penned inside.
There is knowledge God forbid
More than one should own.
So Helen went from me, she did,
Oh, my soul, be glad she did!
Helen all alone!"
2110,Emotion,AlonePoemsRootsAndLeavesThemselvesAlonePoembyWaltWhitman,"ROOTS and leaves themselves alone are these;
Scents brought to men and women from the wild woods, and from the
pond-side,
Breast-sorrel and pinks of love--fingers that wind around tighter
than vines,
Gushes from the throats of birds, hid in the foliage of trees, as the
sun is risen;
Breezes of land and love--breezes set from living shores out to you
on the living sea--to you, O sailors!
Frost-mellow'd berries, and Third-month twigs, offer'd fresh to young
persons wandering out in the fields when the winter breaks up,
Love-buds, put before you and within you, whoever you are,
Buds to be unfolded on the old terms;
If you bring the warmth of the sun to them, they will open, and bring
form, color, perfume, to you;
If you become the aliment and the wet, they will become flowers,
fruits, tall blanches and trees.                             10"
2111,Emotion,AlonePoemsHowIWalkedAloneInTheJunglesOfHeavenPoembyVachelLindsay,"Oh, once I walked in Heaven, all alone
Upon the sacred cliffs above the sky.
God and the angels, and the gleaming saints
Had journeyed out into the stars to die.
They had gone forth to win far citizens,
Bought at great price, bring happiness for all:
By such a harvest make a holier town
And put new life within old Zion's wall.
Each chose a far-off planet for his home,
Speaking of love and mercy, truth and right,
Envied and cursed, thorn-crowned and scourged in time,
Each tasted death on his appointed night.
Then resurrection day from sphere to sphere
Sped on, with all the POWERS arisen again,
While with them came in clouds recruited hosts
Of sun-born strangers and of earth-born men.
And on that day gray prophet saints went down
And poured atoning blood upon the deep,
Till every warrior of old Hell flew free
And all the torture fires were laid asleep.
And Hell's lost company I saw return
Clear-eyed, with plumes of white, the demons bold
Climbed with the angels now on Jacob's stair,
And built a better Zion than the old.
And yet I walked alone on azure cliffs
A lifetime long, and loved each untrimmed vine:
The rotted harps, the swords of rusted gold,
The jungles of all Heaven then were mine.
Oh mesas and throne-mountains that I found!
Oh strange and shaking thoughts that touched me there,
Ere I beheld the bright returning wings
That came to spoil my secret, silent lair!"
2112,Emotion,AlonePoemsAloneICannotBePoembyEmilyDickinson,"298
Alone, I cannot be—
For Hosts—do visit me—
Recordless Company—
Who baffle Key—
They have no Robes, nor Names—
No Almanacs—nor Climes—
But general Homes
Like Gnomes—
Their Coming, may be known
By Couriers within—
Their going—is not—
For they've never gone—"
2113,Emotion,AlonePoemsAlonePoembyYvorWinters,"I, one who never speaks,
Listened days in summer trees,
Each day a rustling leaf.
Then, in time, my unbelief
Grew like my running -
My own eyes did not exist,
When I struck I never missed.
Noon, felt and far away -
My brain is a thousand bees."
2114,Emotion,AlonePoemsDyingAloneInPublicPoembyCinSweetFields,"Like the lonely winter tree
Outstretched branches with never any leaves
Lonely skeletons, with lonely smiles
They look away while trying to hide
Their outstretched lonely eyes"
2115,Emotion,AlonePoemsAlonePoembyJamesJoyce,"The noon's greygolden meshes make
All night a veil,
The shorelamps in the sleeping lake
Laburnum tendrils trail.
The sly reeds whisper to the night
A name-- her name-
And all my soul is a delight,
A swoon of shame."

2117,Emotion,AlonePoemsAloneInMyForestOneDayPoembyMathewLewis,"I was walking alone in my forest one day,
Sleeping awake I went on my way,
And as I lookeed up the sun caught my face,
And my tears fell down in ribbons of lace.
The trees were entwined in the sky locked above,
In an extraordinary symbol of beautiful love,
And I walked all alone in my little wood,
And everything seemed just like it should,
Shafts of light stabbed all around,
Extending their arms straight to the ground,
Serene and peaceful the air hung in cloud,
Enveloping me in a wonderfull shrowd.
And all of this lay before me at hand,
Unfortunately though, no matter how grand
It all was a dream, it all was a fake,
Something I could never see awake.
I was walking alone in my forest one day,
Sleeping awake I went on my way,
And as I lookeed up the sun caught my face,
And my tears fell down in ribbons of lace."
2118,Emotion,AlonePoemsHomeQuiteAlonePoembyEstherLeclerc,"My family drove off mere hours ago
to visit Grandma on her birthday,
thus I am home and quite all alone.
First thing I undertook post-farewell
was doff my duds down to the undies,
hotter, t'was, than Homer Simpson's hell.
Ne'er may I dance to song as I please - -
tho' the spirit may often move me,
for my kin fling up arms, shriek and tease.
My feet like to dance, so, dance I did,
with the family van well out of view.
Sometimes you must blindly trust your id!
I danced like a fiend, singing along,
as graceful as Elaine on 'Seinfeld',
free as a bird both in movement and song...
Exhausted
at last,
I realized - -
a mite
too late
that
in my half-
sorrowful/
all-ecstatic
state
I'd undressed
while still
in front
of
the
house...
SOB (to say the least, eh?)
I fell dumbly to my knees,
clothes GONE from the grass!
Finding the door securely locked,
I spontaneously combusted into ash h h..........
Not really...
I'm hiding beneath
the deck until their
return in days three
using heretofore
unknown mental
powers to post this
poem on PH with glee!
So what - -
I'm
hungry."

2120,Emotion,AlonePoemsLetThemAlonePoembyRobinsonJeffers,"If God has been good enough to give you a poet
Then listen to him. But for God's sake let him alone until he is dead;
no prizes, no ceremony,
They kill the man. A poet is one who listens
To nature and his own heart; and if the noise of the world grows up
around him, and if he is tough enough,
He can shake off his enemies, but not his friends.
That is what withered Wordsworth and muffled Tennyson, and would have
killed Keats; that is what makes
Hemingway play the fool and Faulkner forget his art."
2121,Emotion,AlonePoemsAlonePoembyMayaAngelou,"Lying, thinking
Last night
How to find my soul a home
Where water is not thirsty
And bread loaf is not stone
I came up with one thing
And I don't believe I'm wrong
That nobody,
But nobody
Can make it out here alone.
Alone, all alone
Nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone.
There are some millionaires
With money they can't use
Their wives run round like banshees
Their children sing the blues
They've got expensive doctors
To cure their hearts of stone.
But nobody
No, nobody
Can make it out here alone.
Alone, all alone
Nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone.
Now if you listen closely
I'll tell you what I know
Storm clouds are gathering
The wind is gonna blow
The race of man is suffering
And I can hear the moan,
'Cause nobody,
But nobody
Can make it out here alone.
Alone, all alone
Nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone."
2122,Emotion,AlonePoemsIGoOutOnTheRoadAlonePoembyMikhailYuryevichLermontov,"Alone I set out on the road;
The flinty path is sparkling in the mist;
The night is still. The desert harks to God,
And star with star converses.
The vault is overwhelmed with solemn wonder
The earth in cobalt aura sleeps. . .
Why do I feel so pained and troubled?
What do I harbor: hope, regrets?
I see no hope in years to come,
Have no regrets for things gone by.
All that I seek is peace and freedom!
To lose myself and sleep!
But not the frozen slumber of the grave...
I'd like eternal sleep to leave
My life force dozing in my breast
Gently with my breath to rise and fall;
By night and day, my hearing would be soothed
By voices sweet, singing to me of love.
And over me, forever green,
A dark oak tree would bend and rustle."
2123,Emotion,AlonePoemsEuclidAlonePoembyEdnaStVincentMillay,"Euclid alone has looked on Beauty bare.
Let all who prate of Beauty hold their peace,
And lay them prone upon the earth and cease
To ponder on themselves, the while they stare
At nothing, intricately drawn nowhere
In shapes of shifting lineage; let geese
Gabble and hiss, but heroes seek release
From dusty bondage into luminous air.
O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day,
When first the shaft into his vision shone
Of light anatomized! Euclid alone
Has looked on Beauty bare. Fortunate they
Who, though once only and then but far away,
Have heard her massive sandal set on stone."
2124,Emotion,AlonePoemsNotAlonePoembyAnnaLucija,"My heart feels like an empty shell
Washed up from the sea

From trying to break free

And they're drowning all the bliss
And my lips ache to be touched
By a true loves kiss
But I'm not alone"
2125,Emotion,AlonePoemsWhenIAmAlonePoembyRaviSathasivam,"When I am alone, I think about you

I think our love is in our hearts
I think the good time we've shared together
I think how important you are
I think to share my ideas with you
I think my last dance with you
I think of my last kiss to you
I think your love on me
I think about you everyday
and wanted to let you know
I remember you when I am alone"

Alone I sit under a tree,
Alone I cry.
Alone I dream of you,
Alone I hope and pray,
to God who is oh so merciful and powerful
to let me find my way.
Alone I drift away,
Alone I live today,
and alone I'll die someday."
2127,Emotion,AlonePoemsSonnetXxxviiiSittingAloneLovePoembyMichaelDrayton,"Sitting alone, Love bids me go and write;
Reason plucks back, commanding me to stay,
Boasting that she doth still direct the way,
Or else Love were unable to endite.
Love, growing angry, vexed at the spleen
And scorning Reason's maimed argument,
Straight taxeth Reason, wanting to invent,
Where she with Love conversing hath not been.
Reason, reproached with this coy disdain,
Despiteth Love, and laugheth at her folly;
And Love, condemning Reason's reason wholly,
Thought it in weight too light by many'a grain.
Reason, put back, doth out of sight remove,
And Love alone picks reason out of love."

Again my life become lonely in the military barracks
My life without you, left me with only tears
I know that you never want to see me in tears
But it's been so hard to be here without you
When I am away from you, there is part of me dying
and I don't know where to hide my tears
Although, the distance has kept us away
but your memories keep on speaks to me
Always, It tells me that our love is to be loved
No one makes me feel the way you do
No one loves me so much the way you love me
When I am stay at the door of your heart
then I feel your inside flames that's burns my soul
Oh my love, let God speed my love
and bring me again into your arms soon."

2131,Emotion,AlonePoems2006AlonePoembyDeanaRode,"Tell me why it has to be this way
why I must face this life alone
Sanctuaries I thought were strong
now lay crumbled around my kneeling form
tears that fall down my placid skin
hidden by the rain that falls from a broken sky
Behind blinded eyes I hear the echoes
of those I loved in days now past
taunting me and haunting me in the frozen air
Surrounding and slowly taking away a light forever dimmed
As lightning flashes I see the woman I was float away
leaving me withered and nothing more than an empty shell
as the ones I held dear one by one turn away from me
Tell me why it has to be this way
why I must face this life alone
condemed to walking in the blackness
until it finally consumes me and I fade to nothing."
2132,Emotion,AlonePoemsEveryoneSitsAlonePoembyRobertRorabeck,"Life is the cage
We are all born into
The zoo
Drives down the long
Snake in the rain,
Everyone sits alone
In the park
In the car
In the theatre
Everyone sits alone
And looks through bars
Of their flesh and bone
No eager hand
can grasp out of this
No willing hand has the
Reach,
We touch our flesh
To the flesh of our cages,
We lay down chained
And little birds sing
Beside others miles away
And barking
We touch steering wheels
As the lights cross our eyes
We learn to believe
The birth of shadows
We drive, a line of slaves,
Down the road
Everyone sits alone."
2133,Emotion,AlonePoemsAPantoumAloneOnTheHillsidePoembyLisaCresswellWilkinson,"As she sits alone on the hillside watching the sunrise
Silence is golden, movement is absent
Upon the grassy fields she sees shadowing darkness
The freshness in the air surrounds her intensely
Silence is golden,  movement is absent
Dawn breaks, the skies come alive
The freshness in the air surrounds her intensely
Birds flutter freely tweetering 'good morning'
Dawn breaks, the skies come alive
Upon the grassy fields she sees shadowing darkness
Birds flutter freely tweetering 'good morning'
As she sits alone on the hillside watching the sunrise"
2134,Emotion,AlonePoemsTheImagesAlonePoembyLesMurray,"Scarlet as the cloth draped over a sword,
white as steaming rice, blue as leschenaultia,
old curried towns, the frog in its green human skin;
a ploughman walking his furrow as if in irons, but
as at a whoop of young men running loose
in brick passages, there occurred the thought
like instant stitches all through crumpled silk:
as if he'd had to leap to catch the bullet.
A stench like hands out of the ground.
The willows had like beads in their hair, and
Peenemünde, grunted the dentist's drill, Peenemünde!
Fowls went on typing on every corn key, green
kept crowding the pinks of the peach trees into the sky
but used speech balloons were tacky in the river
and waterbirds had liftoff as at a repeal of gravity."

2136,Emotion,AlonePoemsAsISatAloneByBlueOntariosShoresPoembyWaltWhitman,"AS I sat alone, by blue Ontario's shore,
As I mused of these mighty days, and of peace return'd, and the dead
that return no more,
A Phantom, gigantic, superb, with stern visage, accosted me;
Chant me the poem, it said, that comes from the soul of America--
chant me the carol of victory;
And strike up the marches of Libertad--marches more powerful yet;
And sing me before you go, the song of the throes of Democracy.
(Democracy--the destin'd conqueror--yet treacherous lip-smiles
everywhere,
And Death and infidelity at every step.)
A Nation announcing itself,
I myself make the only growth by which I can be appreciated,       10
I reject none, accept all, then reproduce all in my own forms.
A breed whose proof is in time and deeds;
What we are, we are--nativity is answer enough to objections;
We wield ourselves as a weapon is wielded,
We are powerful and tremendous in ourselves,
We are executive in ourselves--We are sufficient in the variety of
ourselves,
We are the most beautiful to ourselves, and in ourselves;
We stand self-pois'd in the middle, branching thence over the world;
From Missouri, Nebraska, or Kansas, laughing attacks to scorn.
Nothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves,                      20
Whatever appears, whatever does not appear, we are beautiful or
sinful in ourselves only.
(O mother! O sisters dear!
If we are lost, no victor else has destroy'd us;
It is by ourselves we go down to eternal night.)
Have you thought there could be but a single Supreme?
There can be any number of Supremes--One does not countervail
another, any more than one eyesight countervails another, or
one life countervails another.
All is eligible to all,
All is for individuals--All is for you,
No condition is prohibited--not God's, or any.
All comes by the body--only health puts you rapport with the
universe.                                                    30
Produce great persons, the rest follows.
America isolated I sing;
I say that works made here in the spirit of other lands, are so much
poison in The States.
(How dare such insects as we see assume to write poems for America?
For our victorious armies, and the offspring following the armies?)
Piety and conformity to them that like!
Peace, obesity, allegiance, to them that like!
I am he who tauntingly compels men, women, nations,
Crying, Leap from your seats, and contend for your lives!
I am he who walks the States with a barb'd tongue, questioning every
one I meet;                                                  40
Who are you, that wanted only to be told what you knew before?
Who are you, that wanted only a book to join you in your nonsense?
(With pangs and cries, as thine own, O bearer of many children!
These clamors wild, to a race of pride I give.)
O lands! would you be freer than all that has ever been before?
If you would be freer than all that has been before, come listen to
me.
Fear grace--Fear elegance, civilization, delicatesse,
Fear the mellow sweet, the sucking of honey-juice;
Beware the advancing mortal ripening of nature,
Beware what precedes the decay of the ruggedness of states and
men.                                                         50
Ages, precedents, have long been accumulating undirected materials,
America brings builders, and brings its own styles.
The immortal poets of Asia and Europe have done their work, and
pass'd to other spheres,
A work remains, the work of surpassing all they have done.
America, curious toward foreign characters, stands by its own at all
hazards,
Stands removed, spacious, composite, sound--initiates the true use of
precedents,
Does not repel them, or the past, or what they have produced under
their forms,
Takes the lesson with calmness, perceives the corpse slowly borne
from the house,
Perceives that it waits a little while in the door--that it was
fittest for its days,
That its life has descended to the stalwart and well-shaped heir who
approaches,                                                  60
And that he shall be fittest for his days.
Any period, one nation must lead,
One land must be the promise and reliance of the future.
These States are the amplest poem,
Here is not merely a nation, but a teeming nation of nations,
Here the doings of men correspond with the broadcast doings of the
day and night,
Here is what moves in magnificent masses, careless of particulars,
Here are the roughs, beards, friendliness, combativeness, the Soul
loves,
Here the flowing trains--here the crowds, equality, diversity, the
Soul loves.
Land of lands, and bards to corroborate!                           70
Of them, standing among them, one lifts to the light his west-bred
face,
To him the hereditary countenance bequeath'd, both mother's and
father's,
His first parts substances, earth, water, animals, trees,
Built of the common stock, having room for far and near,
Used to dispense with other lands, incarnating this land,
Attracting it Body and Soul to himself, hanging on its neck with
incomparable love,
Plunging his seminal muscle into its merits and demerits,
Making its cities, beginnings, events, diversities, wars, vocal in
him,
Making its rivers, lakes, bays, embouchure in him,
Mississippi with yearly freshets and changing chutes--Columbia,
Niagara, Hudson, spending themselves lovingly in him,        80
If the Atlantic coast stretch, or the Pacific coast stretch, he
stretching with them north or south,
Spanning between them, east and west, and touching whatever is
between them,
Growths growing from him to offset the growth of pine, cedar,
hemlock, live-oak, locust, chestnut, hickory, cottonwood,
orange, magnolia,
Tangles as tangled in him as any cane-brake or swamp,
He likening sides and peaks of mountains, forests coated with
northern transparent ice,
Off him pasturage, sweet and natural as savanna, upland, prairie,
Through him flights, whirls, screams, answering those of the fish-
hawk, mocking-bird, night-heron, and eagle;
His spirit surrounding his country's spirit, unclosed to good and
evil,
Surrounding the essences of real things, old times and present times,
Surrounding just found shores, islands, tribes of red aborigines,  90
Weather-beaten vessels, landings, settlements, embryo stature and
muscle,
The haughty defiance of the Year 1--war, peace, the formation of the
Constitution,
The separate States, the simple, elastic scheme, the immigrants,
The Union, always swarming with blatherers, and always sure and
impregnable,
The unsurvey'd interior, log-houses, clearings, wild animals,
hunters, trappers;
Surrounding the multiform agriculture, mines, temperature, the
gestation of new States,
Congress convening every Twelfth-month, the members duly coming up
from the uttermost parts;
Surrounding the noble character of mechanics and farmers, especially
the young men,
Responding their manners, speech, dress, friendships--the gait they
have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the
presence of superiors,
The freshness and candor of their physiognomy, the copiousness and
decision of their phrenology,                               100
The picturesque looseness of their carriage, their fierceness when
wrong'd,
The fluency of their speech, their delight in music, their curiosity,
good temper, and open-handedness--the whole composite make,
The prevailing ardor and enterprise, the large amativeness,
The perfect equality of the female with the male, the fluid movement
of the population,
The superior marine, free commerce, fisheries, whaling, gold-digging,
Wharf-hemm'd cities, railroad and steamboat lines, intersecting all
points,
Factories, mercantile life, labor-saving machinery, the north-east,
north-west, south-west,
Manhattan firemen, the Yankee swap, southern plantation life,
Slavery--the murderous, treacherous conspiracy to raise it upon the
ruins of all the rest;
On and on to the grapple with it--Assassin! then your life or ours be
the stake--and respite no more.                             110
(Lo! high toward heaven, this day,
Libertad! from the conqueress' field return'd,
I mark the new aureola around your head;
No more of soft astral, but dazzling and fierce,
With war's flames, and the lambent lightnings playing,
And your port immovable where you stand;
With still the inextinguishable glance, and the clench'd and lifted
fist,
And your foot on the neck of the menacing one, the scorner, utterly
crush'd beneath you;
The menacing, arrogant one, that strode and advanced with his
senseless scorn, bearing the murderous knife;
--Lo! the wide swelling one, the braggart, that would yesterday do so
much!                                                       120
To-day a carrion dead and damn'd, the despised of all the earth!
An offal rank, to the dunghill maggots spurn'd.)
Others take finish, but the Republic is ever constructive, and ever
keeps vista;
Others adorn the past--but you, O days of the present, I adorn you!
O days of the future, I believe in you! I isolate myself for your
sake;
O America, because you build for mankind, I build for you!
O well-beloved stone-cutters! I lead them who plan with decision and
science,
I lead the present with friendly hand toward the future.
Bravas to all impulses sending sane children to the next age!
But damn that which spends itself, with no thought of the stain,
pains, dismay, feebleness it is bequeathing.                130
I listened to the Phantom by Ontario's shore,
I heard the voice arising, demanding bards;
By them, all native and grand--by them alone can The States be fused
into the compact organism of a Nation.
To hold men together by paper and seal, or by compulsion, is no
account;
That only holds men together which aggregates all in a living
principle, as the hold of the limbs of the body, or the fibres
of plants.
Of all races and eras, These States, with veins full of poetical
stuff, most need poets, and are to have the greatest, and use
them the greatest;
Their Presidents shall not be their common referee so much as their
poets shall.
(Soul of love, and tongue of fire!
Eye to pierce the deepest deeps, and sweep the world!
--Ah, mother! prolific and full in all besides--yet how long barren,
barren?)                                                    140
Of These States, the poet is the equable man,
Not in him, but off from him, things are grotesque, eccentric, fail
of their full returns,
Nothing out of its place is good, nothing in its place is bad,
He bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion, neither
more nor less,
He is the arbiter of the diverse, he is the key,
He is the equalizer of his age and land,
He supplies what wants supplying--he checks what wants checking,
In peace, out of him speaks the spirit of peace, large, rich,
thrifty, building populous towns, encouraging agriculture,
arts, commerce, lighting the study of man, the Soul, health,
immortality, government;
In war, he is the best backer of the war--he fetches artillery as
good as the engineer's--he can make every word he speaks draw
blood;
The years straying toward infidelity, he withholds by his steady
faith,                                                      150
He is no argurer, he is judgment--(Nature accepts him absolutely;)
He judges not as the judge judges, but as the sun falling round a
helpless thing;
As he sees the farthest, he has the most faith,
His thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things,
In the dispute on God and eternity he is silent,
He sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and denouement,
He sees eternity in men and women--he does not see men and women as
dreams or dots.
For the great Idea, the idea of perfect and free individuals,
For that idea the bard walks in advance, leader of leaders,
The attitude of him cheers up slaves and horrifies foreign
despots.                                                    160
Without extinction is Liberty! without retrograde is Equality!
They live in the feelings of young men, and the best women;
Not for nothing have the indomitable heads of the earth been always
ready to fall for Liberty.
For the great Idea!
That, O my brethren--that is the mission of Poets.
Songs of stern defiance, ever ready,
Songs of the rapid arming, and the march,
The flag of peace quick-folded, and instead, the flag we know,
Warlike flag of the great Idea.
(Angry cloth I saw there leaping!                                 170
I stand again in leaden rain, your flapping folds saluting;
I sing you over all, flying, beckoning through the fight--O the hard-
contested fight!
O the cannons ope their rosy-flashing muzzles! the hurtled balls
scream!
The battle-front forms amid the smoke--the volleys pour incessant
from the line;
Hark! the ringing word, Charge!--now the tussle, and the furious
maddening yells;
Now the corpses tumble curl'd upon the ground,
Cold, cold in death, for precious life of you,
Angry cloth I saw there leaping.)
Are you he who would assume a place to teach, or be a poet here in
The States?
The place is august--the terms obdurate.                          180
Who would assume to teach here, may well prepare himself, body and
mind,
He may well survey, ponder, arm, fortify, harden, make lithe,
himself,
He shall surely be question'd beforehand by me with many and stern
questions.
Who are you, indeed, who would talk or sing to America?
Have you studied out the land, its idioms and men?
Have you learn'd the physiology, phrenology, politics, geography,
pride, freedom, friendship, of the land? its substratums and
objects?
Have you consider'd the organic compact of the first day of the first
year of Independence, sign'd by the Commissioners, ratified by
The States, and read by Washington at the head of the army?
Have you possess'd yourself of the Federal Constitution?
Do you see who have left all feudal processes and poems behind them,
and assumed the poems and processes of Democracy?
Are you faithful to things? do you teach as the land and sea, the
bodies of men, womanhood, amativeness, angers, teach?       190
Have you sped through fleeting customs, popularities?
Can you hold your hand against all seductions, follies, whirls,
fierce contentions? are you very strong? are you really of the
whole people?
Are you not of some coterie? some school or mere religion?
Are you done with reviews and criticisms of life? animating now to
life itself?
Have you vivified yourself from the maternity of These States?
Have you too the old, ever-fresh forbearance and impartiality?
Do you hold the like love for those hardening to maturity; for the
last-born? little and big? and for the errant?
What is this you bring my America?
Is it uniform with my country?
Is it not something that has been better told or done before?     200
Have you not imported this, or the spirit of it, in some ship?
Is it not a mere tale? a rhyme? a prettiness? is the good old cause
in it?
Has it not dangled long at the heels of the poets, politicians,
literats, of enemies' lands?
Does it not assume that what is notoriously gone is still here?
Does it answer universal needs? will it improve manners?
Does it sound, with trumpet-voice, the proud victory of the Union, in
that secession war?
Can your performance face the open fields and the seaside?
Will it absorb into me as I absorb food, air--to appear again in my
strength, gait, face?
Have real employments contributed to it? original makers--not mere
amanuenses?
Does it meet modern discoveries, calibers, facts face to face?    210
What does it mean to me? to American persons, progresses, cities?
Chicago, Kanada, Arkansas? the planter, Yankee, Georgian,
native, immigrant, sailors, squatters, old States, new States?
Does it encompass all The States, and the unexceptional rights of all
the men and women of the earth? (the genital impulse of These
States;)
Does it see behind the apparent custodians, the real custodians,
standing, menacing, silent--the mechanics, Manhattanese,
western men, southerners, significant alike in their apathy,
and in the promptness of their love?
Does it see what finally befalls, and has always finally befallen,
each temporizer, patcher, outsider, partialist, alarmist,
infidel, who has ever ask'd anything of America?
What mocking and scornful negligence?
The track strew'd with the dust of skeletons;
By the roadside others disdainfully toss'd.
Rhymes and rhymers pass away--poems distill'd from foreign poems pass
away,
The swarms of reflectors and the polite pass, and leave ashes;
Admirers, importers, obedient persons, make but the soul of
literature;                                                 220
America justifies itself, give it time--no disguise can deceive it,
or conceal from it--it is impassive enough,
Only toward the likes of itself will it advance to meet them,
If its poets appear, it will in due time advance to meet them--there
is no fear of mistake,
(The proof of a poet shall be sternly deferr'd, till his country
absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorb'd it.)
He masters whose spirit masters--he tastes sweetest who results
sweetest in the long run;
The blood of the brawn beloved of time is unconstraint;
In the need of poems, philosophy, politics, manners, engineering, an
appropriate native grand-opera, shipcraft, any craft, he or she
is greatest who contributes the greatest original practical
example.
Already a nonchalant breed, silently emerging, appears on the
streets,
People's lips salute only doers, lovers, satisfiers, positive
knowers; There will shortly be no more priests--I say their
work is done,                                               230
Death is without emergencies here, but life is perpetual emergencies
here,
Are your body, days, manners, superb? after death you shall be
superb;
Justice, health, self-esteem, clear the way with irresistible power;
How dare you place anything before a man?
Fall behind me, States!
A man before all--myself, typical before all.
Give me the pay I have served for!
Give me to sing the song of the great Idea! take all the rest;
I have loved the earth, sun, animals--I have despised riches,
I have given alms to every one that ask'd, stood up for the stupid
and crazy, devoted my income and labor to others,           240
I have hated tyrants, argued not concerning God, had patience and
indulgence toward the people, taken off my hat to nothing known
or unknown,
I have gone freely with powerful uneducated persons, and with the
young, and with the mothers of families,
I have read these leaves to myself in the open air--I have tried them
by trees, stars, rivers,
I have dismiss'd whatever insulted my own Soul or defiled my Body,
I have claim'd nothing to myself which I have not carefully claim'd
for others on the same terms,
I have sped to the camps, and comrades found and accepted from every
State;
(In war of you, as well as peace, my suit is good, America--sadly I
boast;
Upon this breast has many a dying soldier lean'd, to breathe his
last;
This arm, this hand, this voice, have nourish'd, rais'd, restored,
To life recalling many a prostrate form:)                         250
--I am willing to wait to be understood by the growth of the taste of
myself,
I reject none, I permit all.
(Say, O mother! have I not to your thought been faithful?
Have I not, through life, kept you and yours before me?)
I swear I begin to see the meaning of these things!
It is not the earth, it is not America, who is so great,
It is I who am great, or to be great--it is you up there, or any one;
It is to walk rapidly through civilizations, governments, theories,
Through poems, pageants, shows, to form great individuals.
Underneath all, individuals!                                      260
I swear nothing is good to me now that ignores individuals,
The American compact is altogether with individuals,
The only government is that which makes minute of individuals,
The whole theory of the universe is directed to one single
individual--namely, to You.
(Mother! with subtle sense severe--with the naked sword in your hand,
I saw you at last refuse to treat but directly with individuals.)
Underneath all, nativity,
I swear I will stand by my own nativity--pious or impious, so be it;
I swear I am charm'd with nothing except nativity,
Men, women, cities, nations, are only beautiful from nativity.    270
Underneath all is the need of the expression of love for men and
women,
I swear I have seen enough of mean and impotent modes of expressing
love for men and women,
After this day I take my own modes of expressing love for men and
women.
I swear I will have each quality of my race in myself,
(Talk as you like, he only suits These States whose manners favor the
audacity and sublime turbulence of The States.)
Underneath the lessons of things, spirits, Nature, governments,
ownerships, I swear I perceive other lessons,
Underneath all, to me is myself--to you, yourself--(the same
monotonous old song.)
O I see now, flashing, that this America is only you and me,
Its power, weapons, testimony, are you and me,
Its crimes, lies, thefts, defections, slavery, are you and me,    280
Its Congress is you and me--the officers, capitols, armies, ships,
are you and me,
Its endless gestations of new States are you and me,
The war--that war so bloody and grim--the war I will henceforth
forget--was you and me,
Natural and artificial are you and me,
Freedom, language, poems, employments, are you and me,
Past, present, future, are you and me.
I swear I dare not shirk any part of myself,
Not any part of America, good or bad,
Not the promulgation of Liberty--not to cheer up slaves and horrify
foreign despots,
Not to build for that which builds for mankind,                   290
Not to balance ranks, complexions, creeds, and the sexes,
Not to justify science, nor the march of equality,
Nor to feed the arrogant blood of the brawn beloved of time.
I swear I am for those that have never been master'd!
For men and women whose tempers have never been master'd,
For those whom laws, theories, conventions, can never master.
I swear I am for those who walk abreast with the whole earth!
Who inaugurate one, to inaugurate all.
I swear I will not be outfaced by irrational things!
I will penetrate what it is in them that is sarcastic upon me!    300
I will make cities and civilizations defer to me!
This is what I have learnt from America--it is the amount--and it I
teach again.
(Democracy! while weapons were everywhere aim'd at your breast,
I saw you serenely give birth to immortal children--saw in dreams
your dilating form;
Saw you with spreading mantle covering the world.)
I will confront these shows of the day and night!
I will know if I am to be less than they!
I will see if I am not as majestic as they!
I will see if I am not as subtle and real as they!
I will see if I am to be less generous than they!                 310
I will see if I have no meaning, while the houses and ships have
meaning!
I will see if the fishes and birds are to be enough for themselves,
and I am not to be enough for myself.
I match my spirit against yours, you orbs, growths, mountains,
brutes,
Copious as you are, I absorb you all in myself, and become the master
myself.
America isolated, yet embodying all, what is it finally except
myself?
These States--what are they except myself?
I know now why the earth is gross, tantalizing, wicked--it is for my
sake,
I take you to be mine, you beautiful, terrible, rude forms.
(Mother! bend down, bend close to me your face!
I know not what these plots and wars, and deferments are for;     320
I know not fruition's success--but I know that through war and peace
your work goes on, and must yet go on.)
.... Thus, by blue Ontario's shore,
While the winds fann'd me, and the waves came trooping toward me,
I thrill'd with the Power's pulsations--and the charm of my theme was
upon me,
Till the tissues that held me, parted their ties upon me.
And I saw the free Souls of poets;
The loftiest bards of past ages strode before me,
Strange, large men, long unwaked, undisclosed, were disclosed to me.
O my rapt verse, my call--mock me not!
Not for the bards of the past--not to invoke them have I launch'd you
forth,                                                      330
Not to call even those lofty bards here by Ontario's shores,
Have I sung so capricious and loud, my savage song.
Bards for my own land, only, I invoke;
(For the war, the war is over--the field is clear'd,)
Till they strike up marches henceforth triumphant and onward,
To cheer, O mother, your boundless, expectant soul.
Bards grand as these days so grand!
Bards of the great Idea! Bards of the peaceful inventions! (for the
war, the war is over!)
Yet Bards of the latent armies--a million soldiers waiting, ever-
ready,
Bards towering like hills--(no more these dots, these pigmies, these
little piping straws, these gnats, that fill the hour, to pass
for poets;)                                                 340
Bards with songs as from burning coals, or the lightning's fork'd
stripes!
Ample Ohio's bards--bards for California! inland bards--bards of the
war;)
(As a wheel turns on its axle, so I find my chants turning finally on
the war;)
Bards of pride! Bards tallying the ocean's roar, and the swooping
eagle's scream!
You, by my charm, I invoke!"
2137,Emotion,AlonePoemsIOnlyAmEscapedAloneToTellTheePoembyHowardNemerov,"I tell you that I see her still
At the dark entrance of the hall.
One gas lamp burning near her shoulder
Shone also from her other side
Where hung the long inaccurate glass
Whose pictures were as troubled water.
An immense shadow had its hand
Between us on the floor, and seemed
To hump the knuckles nervously,
A giant crab readying to walk,
Or a blanket moving in its sleep.
You will remember, with a smile
Instructed by movies to reminisce,
How strict her corsets must have been,
How the huge arrangements of her hair
Would certainly betray the least
Impassionate displacement there.
It was no rig for dallying,
And maybe only marriage could
Derange that queenly scaffolding -
As when a great ship, coming home,
Coasts in the harbor, dropping sail
And loosing all the tackle that had laced
Her in the long lanes...
I know
We need not draw this figure out
But all that whalebone came for whales
And all the whales lived in the sea,
In calm beneath the troubled glass,
Until the needle drew their blood.
I see her standing in the hall,
Where the mirror's lashed to blood and foam,
And the black flukes of agony
Beat at the air till the light blows out."
2138,Emotion,AlonePoemsAloneLookingForBlossomsAlongTheRiverPoembyDuFu,"The sorrow of riverside blossoms inexplicable,
And nowhere to complain -- I've gone half crazy.
I look up our southern neighbor. But my friend in wine
Gone ten days drinking. I find only an empty bed.
A thick frenzy of blossoms shrouding the riverside,
I stroll, listing dangerously, in full fear of spring.
Poems, wine -- even this profusely driven, I endure.
Arrangements for this old, white-haired man can wait.
A deep river, two or three houses in bamboo quiet,
And such goings on: red blossoms glaring with white!
Among spring's vociferous glories, I too have my place:
With a lovely wine, bidding life's affairs bon voyage.
Looking east to Shao, its smoke filled with blossoms,
I admire that stately Po-hua wineshop even more.
To empty golden wine cups, calling such beautiful
Dancing girls to embroidered mats -- who could bear it?
East of the river, before Abbot Huang's grave,
Spring is a frail splendor among gentle breezes.
In this crush of peach blossoms opening ownerless,
Shall I treasure light reds, or treasure them dark?
At Madame Huang's house, blossoms fill the paths:
Thousands, tens of thousands haul the branches down.
And butterflies linger playfully -- an unbroken
Dance floating to songs orioles sing at their ease.
I don't so love blossoms I want to die. I'm afraid,
Once they are gone, of old age still more impetuous.
And they scatter gladly, by the branchful. Let's talk
Things over, little buds ---open delicately, sparingly."
2139,Emotion,AlonePoemsAlonePoembyLesaMRK,"The day Caleb died
I was all alone
Lying in a hospital bed
So white and cold
Bleeding
Though I was all alone
The day Caleb died
I was all alone
Praying for someone to come
Watching the door
Hoping and praying
But I was all alone
The day Caleb died
I was all alone
I almost died too
Yet no one was around
And there was no one to hold
For I was all alone
The day Caleb died
I was all alone
I prayed for God to take me, too
But I didn't go
I prayed for someone to hold
But I was all alone"
2140,Emotion,AlonePoemsIWalkAlonePoembysuchulJin,"I walk alone amongst the crowd
My heart still bleeding, pounding loud
Through darkened streets, I walk alone
I have no one to call my own
I need someone to ease the pain
To stop these tears that fall like rain
Alone I walk
To myself I talk
My teers tear apart
My broken heart
Charles R. Brunty"
2141,Emotion,AlonePoemsAlonePoembySaraTeasdale,"I am alone, in spite of love,
In spite of all I take and give—
In spite of all your tenderness,
Sometimes I am not glad to live.
I am alone, as though I stood
On the highest peak of the tired gray world,
About me only swirling snow,
Above me, endless space unfurled;
With earth hidden and heaven hidden,
And only my own spirit's pride
To keep me from the peace of those
Who are not lonely, having died."
2142,Emotion,AlonePoemsAloneAndColdPoembyheavymetalInsanity,"Im nothing without
you Im dead inside
I cant move on
I know cuz I've tried
You threw me out the door
Im a lost soul forever moor
These are my tears
My tears of pain
with out you my
world is constant rain
Love is a lie theres nosuch thing
all it is is a firey black ring
You have lied to me but worse
you've played with my heart
You tried explain just please
dont even start
You said you loved me
you said you cared
how could you dismiss
everything we shared
So the damage is done
and all you did was run
I will never love anyone but you
That day rain came and the wind just blew
When I saw you my heart was sold
but now I sit all alone and cold."
2143,Emotion,AlonePoemsAloneLookingAtTheMountainPoembyLiPo,"All the birds have flown up and gone;
A lonely cloud floats leisurely by.
We never tire of looking at each other -
Only the mountain and I."
2144,Emotion,AlonePoemsAloneAloneAlonePoembySajuAbraham,"He was writing his sermon.
He'd locked his room.
He wanted none to break his thoughts.
No one would ever disturb him.
He was alone, alone, alone.
He was fixing his false teeth,
behind closed doors.
He wanted none to peep in on his secret.
No one would want to know if he had teeth.
He was alone, alone, alone.
He was counting his coins,
in the darkness of his shabby hut.
He wanted none to know his wealth.
No one wanted his meager sum.
He was alone, alone, alone.
You and I are all like them,
locked behind our own doors,
not wanting to be pried into.
Not knowing how isolated we are.
We are just alone, alone, alone."
2145,Emotion,AlonePoemsTogetherWeReAlonePoembyPaulMoosberg,"There is no place or grace, for all the human race
The race of will, to race and kill
As anger fills and kills the thrill
That we hold near and dear, we cherished children fear
The wraith of God, the wraith of man
The wraith of future shines the plan
That we can maul it all, from front to back we saw
The answer here, the answer there
And never thought to question where
Did anger’s state of hate, combined collaborate
That one is right, and powering
Then one will fight for might to sing
The battle long of song, dividing right from wrong
The death of you, the death of me
The death of us for all to see
No one can own this bone, together we’re alone"
2146,Emotion,AlonePoemsAloneInYourArmsPoembySydneyDaniels,"Common interests brought us together,
Conversations on which we could agree.
There has never been enough trust to discuss
Issues in which we'd disagree.
Our hearts don't have the magic connection
That allow our brains to share the same waves.
Cupid has not struck us with his arrows,
To each other's soul we are not slaves.
We occupy the same space, living in orbit.
Our eyes meet across silence the size of an ocean,
And while our intentions are in the right place,
Fear is the source of our eternal devotion.
You don't know how much I need you.
I don't know why I expect you to read my mind.
It is amazingly easy to feel alone in your arms;
The mystery is why romance is so hard to find."
2147,Emotion,AlonePoemsHeStandsAlonePoembyGrahamJones,"He stands alone now etched by time
As though was meant to be
His frame all bent and twisted
For all who pass to see
It wasn't always as it is
When children came around
To run and laugh and shriek with glee
He revelled in the sound
But age and weather took its toll
And disease had hit him hard
A surgeons cuts had saved his life
For which he didn't charge
And so he stands alone but proud
To survey what could be seen
The only oak for miles around
Upon the village green."
2148,Emotion,AlonePoemsAlonePoembySiegfriedSassoon,"I’ve listened: and all the sounds I heard
Were music,—wind, and stream, and bird.
With youth who sang from hill to hill
I’ve listened: my heart is hungry still.
I’ve looked: the morning world was green;
Bright roofs and towers of town I’ve seen;
And stars, wheeling through wingless night.
I’ve looked: and my soul yet longs for light.
I’ve thought: but in my sense survives
Only the impulse of those lives
That were my making. Hear me say
‘I’ve thought!’—and darkness hides my day."
2149,Emotion,AlonePoemsAlonePoembyAmbroseBierce,"In contact, lo! the flint and steel,
By sharp and flame, the thought reveal
That he the metal, she the stone,
Had cherished secretly alone."
2150,Emotion,AlonePoemsInTheBeginingOurLordWasAlonePoembyArthurKnackmus,"In the beginning our Father was alone wanting company.
So to Himself said, 'I'll just create friends to suit my fancy.'
They will all be Holy angels having freedom of choice.
These Holy angels will be perfect in beauty having a voice.
All these angelic beings will have wings to fly away.
But I will set boundaries and limits where they are to stay.
They will also have eyes to see where to stop.
With ears to hear praises from the top.
By now the angels were given the sense of touch.
To the hierarchy in Heaven, was loved very much.
This sense of touch could be the feel of a wheel.
Boy what a deal.
And among other things could be pleasure,
With God's measure.
This pleasure with God's measure,
was their treasure.
All these spirits were given a mind.
To especially be kind.
Possessing abilities to voice their choice.
Think at a blink, even wink, not blind.
Hearing with ears even from behind.
The rank of the Cherubim was made of winged little girls and boys.
These Cherubs walked and talked with God who gave them toys.
The boys played with balls.
The girls played with dolls.
These Cherubs were happy, being content with all.
God was pleased with what He saw.
God gave all angels senses of smell and taste.
Instructing them they could lick in haste.
But never to taste paste or waste.
God gave angels given knowledge.
This sixth sense not taught in college.
The wisdom acquired,
Will be required.
If so desired.
So stay chaste.
For the chase.
Being eternally chased.
At this time there was no sin, which is vice.
Everything in Heavens chorus was joyous and nice.
Our Father is Perfect So He didn't have to think twice.
He made no mistakes that could not be corrected.
When creating He got exactly what He expected.
Through His Perfection is why God is always respected.
Every thing God created,
Never became outdated.
He could raise His finger,
To invent some timber.
Or blink an eye,
Creating the sky.
That Perfect magic Man could make something,
Simply out of nothing.
God created no two things exactly the same.
A female angel by nickname,
Was called a dame.
God could create showers,
For all the flowers.
What was left of the rain,
Ran down the drain.
After these showers.
The man took to the dame.
As a gift, these flowers.
For the main spirit game,
Was to win the dame.
Then your spirit life and her name.
Would never be the same."
2151,Emotion,AlonePoemsAloneAndRepentantPoembyBjørnstjerneBjørnson,"A friend I possess, whose whispers just said,
""God's peace!"" to my night-watching mind.
When daylight is gone and darkness brings dread,
He ever the way can find.
He utters no word to smite and to score;
He, too, has known sin and its grief.
He heals with his look the place that is sore,
And stays till I have relief.
He takes for his own the deed that is such
That sorrows of heart increase.
He cleanses the wound with so gentle a touch,
The pain must give way to peace.
He followed each hope the heights that would scale
Reproached not a hapless descent.
He stands here just now, so mild, but so pale; --
In time he shall know what it meant."
2152,Emotion,AlonePoemsLearningToGoAlonePoembyAnnTaylor,"Come, my darling, come away,
Take a pretty walk to-day;
Run along, and never fear,
I'll take care of baby dear:
Up and down with little feet,
That's the way to walk, my sweet.
Now it is so very near,
Soon she'll get to mother dear.
There she comes along at last:
Here's my finger, hold it fast:
Now one pretty little kiss,
After such a walk as this."
2153,Emotion,AlonePoemsSonnet79WhilstIAloneDidCallUponThyAidPoembyWilliamShakespeare,"Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,
But now my gracious numbers are decayed,
And my sick Muse doth give an other place.
I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument
Deserves the travail of a worthier pen,
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
He robs thee of, and pays it thee again.
He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word
From thy behaviour; beauty doth he give,
And found it in thy cheek; he can afford
No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.
Then thank him not for that which he doth say,
Since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay."

2156,Emotion,AlonePoemsAlonePoembyEdgarAllanPoe,"From childhood's hour I have not been
As others were; I have not seen
As others saw; I could not bring
My passions from a common spring.
From the same source I have not taken
My sorrow; I could not awaken
My heart to joy at the same tone;
And all I loved, I loved alone.
Then- in my childhood, in the dawn
Of a most stormy life- was drawn
From every depth of good and ill
The mystery which binds me still:
From the torrent, or the fountain,
From the red cliff of the mountain,
From the sun that round me rolled
In its autumn tint of gold,
From the lightning in the sky
As it passed me flying by,
From the thunder and the storm,
And the cloud that took the form
(When the rest of Heaven was blue)
Of a demon in my view."
2157,Emotion,AlonePoemsTheGardenerIxWhenIGoAloneAtNightPoembyRabindranathTagore,"When I go alone at night to my
love-tryst, birds do not sing, the wind
does not stir, the houses on both sides
of the street stand silent.
It is my own anklets that grow loud
at every step and I am ashamed.
When I sit on my balcony and listen
for his footsteps, leaves do not rustle
on the trees, and the water is still in
the river like the sword on the knees
of a sentry fallen asleep.
It is my own heart that beats wildly
--I do not know how to quiet it.
When my love comes and sits by
my side, when my body trembles and
my eyelids droop, the night darkens,
the wind blows out the lamp, and the
clouds draw veils over the stars.
It is the jewel at my own breast
that shines and gives light. I do not
know how to hide it."
2158,Emotion,AlonePoemsAloneLateAtNightPoembySidiJMahtrow,"'So round, so firm
So fully packed,
So free and easy.
(Well maybe not.)
The product regulated by both
The Food and Drug Administration
And the Department of Agriculture,
Is sold to anyone who can ante up the buck or so,
And it's addictive, just ask someone who knows.
The flip top package invites you in
And from there on, you're on your own.
Appearances are everything and
Madison Avenue has gone out of its way
To entice the unsuspecting to buy not
One but two or more.
Then there's the matter of the food companies
Actually being in this business,
Peddling taste, while ignoring
Additives that may get you in the end.
For those who are discerning,
The manufacturer offers different varieties.
So that if you tire of one,
Or perhaps are just adventuresome
You can choose.
Once hooked, there should always be a stash
Hidden somewhere for that moment when the pangs
Strike and shops are closed, and a long night
Awaits before the morn.
The parent company is one perhaps you recognize,
Kraft, Conagra, Tyson's, Smuckers,
No, not any of these but still
A name familiar in most households.
So in the privacy of your home,
Reach way back, behind all the other items
And choose that which for the moment
Promises to sate your lust.
Best to keep it to yourself
As some may make fun of you for
Being so entrapped in a web
From which there is no escape.
Your offer to share
Will go unappreciated and
You may suffer rejection
For simply trying to do a good deed,
Spreading the word,
Making the product more acceptable
To those that scorn something
That has been a pacifier
For generations.
But first let's consider the shortcomings
That which is so long and cool
Is spiced with flavorings and of course
Like all tobacco products has a fair amount of sugar
Either there originally or added for quality assurance.
Quality Assurance, Sure!
Pop the top and admire the way in which
Industry has met the challenge of putting the most
Of those buggers into an orderly display.
No space wasted here.
And the march of color across the tops
Of those you lust for,
Is enough to cause one to consider dumping
The whole of them on the counter so you can
Have your way with them.
But wait,
Place you nose up close
Close your eyes.
What aroma stirs the emotions?
Breath deeply
And exhale slowly
This is how it should be.
Ah! ! !
Now greedily take one and
Roll it between the thumb and forefinger.
Examine it carefully,
Caress it with you lips,
Let the tongue explore.
Aren't you glad you're alone
No one should share the
Ecstacy of the unknown.
The touch and the taste.
It's too late,
Emotions take control
The first is gone and
You are already reaching for another.
Before you know,
The pack is empty
And yet you are not satisfied,
What to do but open another,
Can of Hormel Vienna Sausages."
2159,Emotion,AlonePoemsAloneInTheWoodsPoembyStevieSmith,"Alone in the woods I felt
The bitter hostility of the sky and the trees
Nature has taught her creatures to hate
Man that fusses and fumes
Unquiet man
As the sap rises in the trees
As the sap paints the trees a violent green
So rises the wrath of Nature's creatures
At man
So paints the face of Nature a violent green.
Nature is sick at man
Sick at his fuss and fume
Sick at his agonies
Sick at his gaudy mind
That drives his body
Ever more quickly
More and more
In the wrong direction."
2160,Emotion,AlonePoemsAloneInAnnArborPoembyUriahHamilton,"I walked alone
In Ann Arbor last night,
But you were
With me again on South Main
Among the college kids,
The restaurants and book stores,
Everyone moving around,
The folk music
Coming from the Ark;
Sweet Lady, you’ve won my heart,
Even though we continue to linger
So painfully apart."
2161,Emotion,AlonePoemsAloneSoAlonePoembyRuthwarren,"I hang my head in my burning palms,
tears sting against my soul, searching
for the calm. Heartaches like never
before, broken, so lonely and torn.
Never to see the light, no tunnel to
be seen, sitting here alone, within my
silent screams. No hand to reach for, no
one to hold me close, I have never
felt so alone.
No one to pull me to safety, no one to
turn to, just broken hearted, searching
for life anew. No embrace, just tears
that fall down my face.
No guarantees on life or love, nothing
but dark clouds linger above. The world
tightens her grip with every breath I take,
making the next step impossible to take.
Alone in a world, the void is here, taking
over my being, taking my life, but in this
void I lose the strife. Haunting thoughts
consume me, just looking through these
tears, just wanting to be free."
2162,Emotion,AlonePoemsAllAlonePoembyMaryDarbyRobinson,"I.
Ah! wherefore by the Church-yard side,
Poor little LORN ONE, dost thou stray?
Thy wavy locks but thinly hide
The tears that dim thy blue-eye's ray;
And wherefore dost thou sigh, and moan,
And weep, that thou art left alone?
II.
Thou art not left alone, poor boy,
The Trav'ller stops to hear thy tale;
No heart, so hard, would thee annoy!
For tho' thy mother's cheek is pale
And withers under yon grave stone,
Thou art not, Urchin, left alone.
III.
I know thee well ! thy yellow hair
In silky waves I oft have seen;
Thy dimpled face, so fresh and fair,
Thy roguish smile, thy playful mien
Were all to me, poor Orphan, known,
Ere Fate had left thee--all alone!
IV.
Thy russet coat is scant, and torn,
Thy cheek is now grown deathly pale!
Thy eyes are dim, thy looks forlorn,
And bare thy bosom meets the gale;
And oft I hear thee deeply groan,
That thou, poor boy, art left alone.
V.
Thy naked feet are wounded sore
With thorns, that cross thy daily road;
The winter winds around thee roar,
The church-yard is thy bleak abode;
Thy pillow now, a cold grave stone--
And there thou lov'st to grieve--alone!
VI.
The rain has drench'd thee, all night long;
The nipping frost thy bosom froze;
And still, the yewtree-shades among,
I heard thee sigh thy artless woes;
I heard thee, till the day-star shone
In darkness weep--and weep alone!
VII.
Oft have I seen thee, little boy,
Upon thy lovely mother's knee;
For when she liv'd--thou wert her joy,
Though now a mourner thou must be!
For she lies low, where yon grave-stone
Proclaims, that thou art left alone.
VIII.
Weep, weep no more; on yonder hill
The village bells are ringing, gay;
The merry reed, and brawling rill
Call thee to rustic sports away.
Then wherefore weep, and sigh, and moan,
A truant from the throng--alone?
IX.
""I cannot the green hill ascend,
""I cannot pace the upland mead;
""I cannot in the vale attend,
""To hear the merry-sounding reed:
""For all is still, beneath yon stone,
""Where my poor mother's left alone!
X.
""I cannot gather gaudy flowers
""To dress the scene of revels loud--
""I cannot pass the ev'ning hours
""Among the noisy village croud--
""For, all in darkness, and alone
""My mother sleeps, beneath yon stone.
XI.
""See how the stars begin to gleam
""The sheep-dog barks, 'tis time to go;--
""The night-fly hums, the moonlight beam
""Peeps through the yew-tree's shadowy row--
""It falls upon the white grave-stone,
""Where my dear mother sleeps alone.--
XII.
""O stay me not, for I must go
""The upland path in haste to tread;
""For there the pale primroses grow
""They grow to dress my mother's bed.--
""They must, ere peep of day, be strown,
""Where she lies mould'ring all alone.
XIII.
""My father o'er the stormy sea
""To distant lands was borne away,
""And still my mother stay'd with me
""And wept by night and toil'd by day.
""And shall I ever quit the stone
""Where she is, left, to sleep alone.
XIV.
""My father died; and still I found
""My mother fond and kind to me;
""I felt her breast with rapture bound
""When first I prattled on her knee--
""And then she blest my infant tone
""And little thought of yon grave-stone.
XV.
""No more her gentle voice I hear,
""No more her smile of fondness see;
""Then wonder not I shed the tear
""She would have DIED, to follow me!
""And yet she sleeps beneath yon stone
""And I STILL LIVE--to weep alone.
XVI.
""The playful kid, she lov'd so well
""From yon high clift was seen to fall;
""I heard, afar, his tink'ling bell--
""Which seem'd in vain for aid to call--
""I heard the harmless suff'rer moan,
""And grieved that he was left alone.
XVII.
""Our faithful dog grew mad, and died,
""The lightning smote our cottage low--
""We had no resting-place beside
""And knew not whither we should go,--
""For we were poor,--and hearts of stone
""Will never throb at mis'ry's groan.
XVIII.
""My mother still surviv'd for me,
""She led me to the mountain's brow,
""She watch'd me, while at yonder tree
""I sat, and wove the ozier bough;
""And oft she cried, ""fear not, MINE OWN!
""Thou shalt not, BOY, be left ALONE.""
XXI.
""The blast blew strong, the torrent rose
""And bore our shatter'd cot away;
""And, where the clear brook swiftly flows--
""Upon the turf at dawn of day,
""When bright the sun's full lustre shone,
""I wander'd, FRIENDLESS--and ALONE!""
XX.
Thou art not, boy, for I have seen
Thy tiny footsteps print the dew,
And while the morning sky serene
Spread o'er the hill a yellow hue,
I heard thy sad and plaintive moan,
Beside the cold sepulchral stone.
XXI.
And when the summer noontide hours
With scorching rays the landscape spread,
I mark'd thee, weaving fragrant flow'rs
To deck thy mother's silent bed!
Nor, at the church-yard's simple stone,
Wert, thou, poor Urchin, left alone.
XXII.
I follow'd thee, along the dale
And up the woodland's shad'wy way:
I heard thee tell thy mournful tale
As slowly sunk the star of day:
Nor, when its twinkling light had flown,
Wert thou a wand'rer, all alone.
XXIII.
""O! yes, I was! and still shall be
""A wand'rer, mourning and forlorn;
""For what is all the world to me--
""What are the dews and buds of morn?
""Since she, who left me sad, alone
""In darkness sleeps, beneath yon stone!
XXIV.
""No brother's tear shall fall for me,
""For I no brother ever knew;
""No friend shall weep my destiny
""For friends are scarce, and tears are few;
""None do I see, save on this stone
""Where I will stay, and weep alone!
XXV.
""My Father never will return,
""He rests beneath the sea-green wave;
""I have no kindred left, to mourn
""When I am hid in yonder grave!
""Not one ! to dress with flow'rs the stone;--
""Then--surely , I AM LEFT ALONE!"""
2163,Emotion,AlonePoemsLeaveMeAlonePoembyScarboroughGypsy,"I’d like to awake
Without being woken
To just sit and think
With no word spoken
Allow me some time
To have on my own
When no one comes round
Or calls on the phone
I’d just like some space
Some privacy for me
I’d like to be left
With no company
To go to the bathroom
And not be disturbed
To put on my hairdryer
Without being heard
To lay in my bed
Minus the dogs
To cruise round the house
Without any tog’s
Let doors that I shut
Remain unopened
And none of my things
Be moved or broken
A special room
To call my own
A private place
To be alone
Lay back, relax
Chill out, just be
With no one else
Except for me."
2164,Emotion,AlonePoemsOnTheBeachAtNightAlonePoembyWaltWhitman,"ON the beach at night alone,
As the old mother sways her to and fro, singing her husky song,
As I watch the bright stars shining--I think a thought of the clef of
the universes, and of the future.
A VAST SIMILITUDE interlocks all,
All spheres, grown, ungrown, small, large, suns, moons, planets,
comets, asteroids,
All the substances of the same, and all that is spiritual upon the
same,
All distances of place, however wide,
All distances of time--all inanimate forms,
All Souls--all living bodies, though they be ever so different, or in
different worlds,
All gaseous, watery, vegetable, mineral processes--the fishes, the
brutes,                                                      10
All men and women--me also;
All nations, colors, barbarisms, civilizations, languages;
All identities that have existed, or may exist, on this globe, or any
globe;
All lives and deaths--all of the past, present, future;
This vast similitude spans them, and always has spann'd, and shall
forever span them, and compactly hold them, and enclose them."

2166,Emotion,AlonePoemsAloneInCrowdsToWanderOnPoembyThomasMoore,"Alone in crowds to wander on,
And feel that all the charm is gone
Which voices dear and eyes beloved
Shed round us once, where'er we roved --
This, this the doom must be
Of all who've loved, and loved to see
The few bright things they thought would stay
For ever near them, die away.
Though fairer forms around us throng,
Their smiles to others all belong,
And want that charm which dwells alone
Round those the fond heart calls its own,
Where, where the sunny brow?
The long-known voice -- where are they now?
Thus ask I still, nor ask in vain,
The silence answers all too plain.
Oh, what is Fancy's magic worth,
If all her art cannot call forth
One bliss like those we felt of old
From lips now mute, and eyes now cold?
No, no -- her spell in vain --
As soon could she bring back again
Those eyes themselves from out the grave,
As wake again one bliss they gave."

2168,Emotion,AlonePoemsDrinkingAlonePoembyLiPo,"I take my wine jug out among the flowers
to drink alone, without friends.
I raise my cup to entice the moon.
That, and my shadow, makes us three.
But the moon doesn't drink,
and my shadow silently follows.
I will travel with moon and shadow,
happy to the end of spring.
When I sing, the moon dances.
When I dance, my shadow dances, too.
We share life's joys when sober.
Drunk, each goes a separate way.
Constant friends, although we wander,
we'll meet again in the Milky Way.

I am alone in hospital,
nurses coming and out,
I feel I am alone.
Even nurses here and there,
I am out of the world,
sad and pain hit my face,
how bad to be alone.
The doctor whispered to me,
be brave, don, t afraid,
tomorrow will be better,
be strong as a stone.
My mind had been ruined,
i can, t thinking at all,
the sky seems hazy,
how sad to be alone.
........
Seconds seem ages;
the day a thousand year,
the fear inside my body,
told me, you are alone.
Suddenly I saw a shade,
could that be my wife?
Could sons come to see,
how sad I am alone.
The shade became too close,
O, God they are my sons,
my love is coming with them,
how bad I was alone.
By love they covered my sky,
by love returned my soul,
their love grant me the strength,
in front of being alone.
Tomorrow will repair my heart,
tomorrow is a biggest day,
even if I died that day.
By love I am not alone."

2172,Emotion,AlonePoemsEatingAlonePoembyLiYoungLee,"I've pulled the last of the year's young onions.
The garden is bare now.  The ground is cold,
brown and old.  What is left of the day flames
in the maples at the corner of my
eye.  I turn, a cardinal vanishes.
By the cellar door, I wash the onions,
then drink from the icy metal spigot.
Once, years back, I walked beside my father
among the windfall pears.  I can't recall
our words.  We may have strolled in silence.  But
I still see him bend that way-left hand braced
on knee, creaky-to lift and hold to my
eye a rotten pear.  In it, a hornet
spun crazily, glazed in slow, glistening juice.
It was my father I saw this morning
waving to me from the trees.  I almost
called to him, until I came close enough
to see the shovel, leaning where I had
left it, in the flickering, deep green shade.
White rice steaming, almost done.  Sweet green peas
fried in onions.  Shrimp braised in sesame
oil and garlic.  And my own loneliness.
What more could I, a young man, want."
2173,Emotion,AlonePoemsIDidnTStandAlonePoembyCharlesMMoore,"I was born a wild child
a navigators son
from the slums I took my chances
and was always on the run
fought my way with others like me
and society who blamed
my behaviour on my parents
and misfortune on my name
I bled for my existence
and stole to feed my need
I would put on many faces
to extrapolate my breed
to defend the others round me
and provide some hopeful care
to the familys with broken hearts
and dreams that went nowhere
In the darkness of a thousand scars
that tore away my flesh
my hands would reach into
the soul and bones of what I'm worth
and though the sun was shining
trying to brighten up the day
in the poverty of mouths to feed
the slums are always grey
In a history of violence
and the screams that no-one heard
in a mothers tears and fathers fears
I learned every word
and paraded with a vengeance
on the streets of cobblestones
that my heart was independant
and I didn't stand alone."

2176,Emotion,AlonePoemsGentlemanAlonePoembyPabloNeruda,"The young maricones and the horny muchachas,
The big fat widows delirious from insomnia,
The young wives thirty hours' pregnant,
And the hoarse tomcats that cross my garden at night,
Like a collar of palpitating sexual oysters
Surround my solitary home,
Enemies of my soul,
Conspirators in pajamas
Who exchange deep kisses for passwords.
Radiant summer brings out the lovers
In melancholy regiments,
Fat and thin and happy and sad couples;
Under the elegant coconut palms, near the ocean and moon,
There is a continual life of pants and panties,
A hum from the fondling of silk stockings,
And women's breasts that glisten like eyes.
The salary man, after a while,
After the week's tedium, and the novels read in bed at night,
Has decisively fucked his neighbor,
And now takes her to the miserable movies,
Where the heroes are horses or passionate princes,
And he caresses her legs covered with sweet down
With his ardent and sweaty palms that smell like cigarettes.
The night of the hunter and the night of the husband
Come together like bed sheets and bury me,
And the hours after lunch, when the students and priests are masturbating,
And the animals mount each other openly,
And the bees smell of blood, and the flies buzz cholerically,
And cousins play strange games with cousins,
And doctors glower at the husband of the young patient,
And the early morning in which the professor, without a thought,
Pays his conjugal debt and eats breakfast,
And to top it all off, the adulterers, who love each other truly
On beds big and tall as ships:
So, eternally,
This twisted and breathing forest crushes me
With gigantic flowers like mouth and teeth
And black roots like fingernails and shoes.

2177,Emotion,AlonePoemsManAlonePoembyLouiseBogan,"It is yourself you seek
In a long rage,
Scanning through light and darkness
Mirrors, the page,
Where should reflected be
Those eyes and that thick hair,
That passionate look, that laughter.
You should appear
Within the book, or doubled,
Freed, in the silvered glass;
Into all other bodies
Yourself should pass.
The glass does not dissolve;
Like walls the mirrors stand;
The printed page gives back
Words by another hand.
And your infatuate eye
Meets not itself below;
Strangers lie in your arms
As I lie now."

Alone in good health
Alone I try to understand
Alone I seek knowledge
Alone I share what is mine
Alone I try not to be alone
Alone when my time has come, I pass away"
2182,Emotion,AlonePoemsAloneInACastlePartOnePoembyLesaMRK,"Once there stood a castle,
With towers so tall of stone,
So strong and white
Glowing like ivory bone
In the castle lived a princess
So lovely and so kind
Many times she dreamt of him
The prince she'd someday find
When the time finally came
And they stood side by side
Her heart sang with beautiful feelings
That time could not abide
They spent all their time together
Until summer came to an end
He then kissed her and departed
Disappearing into the wind
At nights she stood and waited
But never once did he return
Her head was bent with sorrow
Her eyes swollen from tears
For she knew he would not return tomorrow
And she would be alone for all her years
She thought she had given him her heart
For what they shared was special and true
But when sorrow came he left her
For he knew nothing else to do
The princess had nothing left to hang onto
No tiny thread of hope
She had no one left to turn to
And no one to help her cope
She went to the places they had been
Yet it was not the same without him
The flowers no longer cheered her
And the bright sun had become dim
He hadn't meant to hurt her
But the princess was lost in her own woe
All she felt was betrayal
In knowing he had to go
But with time she came to realize
He did what he had to do
Although her pain was horrible
He felt that pain, too.
The two had shared so much
They had given all they had
And knowing it was truly over
Oh, how it made the princess sad
She hadn't thought she would truly lose him
No matter how bad it may have been
They were more than in love
He had been her one and only friend
One night she found a message
Scrawled on the castle wall.
It said only, 'I love you, '
And the princess's tears began to fall.
She knew she'd always miss him;
He'd remain forever in her heart,
And even if they weren't together,
They'd never truly be apart...."
2183,Emotion,AlonePoemsAlonePoembyDeborahAger,"Over the fence, the dead settle in
for a journey. Nine o'clock.
You are alone for the first time
today. Boys asleep. Husband out.
A beer bottle sweats in your hand,
and sea lavender clogs the air
with perfume. Think of yourself.
Your arms rest with nothing to do
after weeks spent attending to others.
Your thoughts turn to whether
butter will last the week, how much
longer the car can run on its partial tank of gas."

2190,Emotion,AlonePoemsAloneAndDrinkingUnderTheMoonPoembyLiPo,"Amongst the flowers I
am alone with my pot of wine
drinking by myself; then lifting
my cup I asked the moon
to drink with me, its reflection
and mine in the wine cup, just
the three of us; then I sigh
for the moon cannot drink,
and my shadow goes emptily along
with me never saying a word;
with no other friends here, I can
but use these two for company;
in the time of happiness, I
too must be happy with all
around me; I sit and sing
and it is as if the moon
accompanies me; then if I
dance, it is my shadow that
dances along with me; while
still not drunk, I am glad
to make the moon and my shadow
into friends, but then when
I have drunk too much, we
all part; yet these are
friends I can always count on
these who have no emotion
whatsoever; I hope that one day
we three will meet again,
deep in the Milky Way."

2192,Emotion,PovertyPoemsPovertyPoembyVeeraiyahSubbulakshmi,"This animal is there,
Waiting with cruel claws,
The teeth are sharp,
Always hungry and vigil,
Eating all our flesh,
Leaving us in skeletal structure,
This animal likes the shout,
As our cries are the lullabies,
It never sleeps, but pretends to be quiet,
It sucks our blood for its thirst,
Our sisters grow beautiful,
Our brothers are handsome and bold,
They are disturbed by this animal,
Whenever they go out for survival,
Brains are the factories of sorrows,
Before we reach our rice pots,
This animal regularly eat the last morsel,
Millions of people eat a meal a day,
As long as this animal is happy and gay,
where the human are careless and weak,
This animal is very strong and in attack mode."

2198,Emotion,PovertyPoemsPovertyPoembyHenryLawson,"I hate this grinding poverty—
To toil, and pinch, and borrow,
And be for ever haunted by
The spectre of to-morrow.
It breaks the strong heart of a man,
It crushes out his spirit—
Do what he will, do what he can,
However high his merit!
I hate the praise that Want has got
From preacher and from poet,
The cant of those who know it not
To blind the men who know it.
The greatest curse since man had birth,
An everlasting terror:
The cause of half the crime on earth,
The cause of half the error."
2199,Emotion,PovertyPoemsPovertyTheCursePoembyVegaDestinyStar,"Poverty
Is an baleful curse.
A more terrible curse than the plaque.

Brings on fearfulness.
Like a malicious dragon.
Poverty is ones worst adversary.
Hard to prevent and slay."
2200,Emotion,PovertyPoemsPovertyIsSlaveryPoembyAbekahEmmanuel,"It may be buried memories from my past
Though still fresh and striking to my heart
How I wish its effects ceases to last
But anytime it flashes my mind, it makes me sad.
I stopped writing about it few months ago
For it irritates the Jones and saddens the slaves
But whenever I spend time alone
I can't help it but to write on my slate.
Haven long been a vibrant slave myself
I have seen, felt and lived in slavery
As it drags multitudes to their premature graves
And causes the deceived, lots of misery.
I remember how it had laid a peasant farmer
To his peaceful rest, because he had a cut
But was not able to seek the help of the doctor,
It is a pity, I feel the pains, it pierces my heart.
I remember my mum, cooking in that dark kitchen,
Fanning the tripod stand with her mouth
Tears dripping from her eyes, what a poor maiden!
I feel her pains too, but I look into the future and laugh.
I also remember how dad returns from the farm, his economy
Where he had lived most of his life, he is very exhausted
But mummy still consoles him, what a happy colony!
Butter and sugar, have in their lives, never tasted.
But they always have one thing, that never perishes,
Although, they have been in slavery for many years
They have hope and dream of a new dawn of riches
Where poverty shall no more be their portion."
2201,Emotion,PovertyPoemsPovertyACurseOrABoonPoembyAftabAlam,"Long ago there was a king,
Sober, sublime and sincere,
One Saturday night, came an angel,
'Thou hath given a wish that ye can,
Keepeth it forever—ordain by Lord, '
Quite for a moment—then said the king,
'O' Holy Angel, would you come next night?
I have to think and discuss with my coterie,
As ye brought a handsome lucky lottery,
Why not, take your own time, you take,
But bear in mind, only secluded wish,
If ye committed a mistake, ye will miss,
Be calm and cool, mind it—no mistake,
That night King lost his slumber,
Went to the Queen and winked,
Thou art be a Queen forever—
I have been rewarded a wish-my Miss,
He groped many tricks to be a King-
He completely changed himself with ring,
Of greed that bred evil within him,
He planned to have the wish with whim,
Next Saturday the Angel came and asked,
Your wish I shall be keeping in that pot-
You may keep it in a safe place, it's hot,
Okay—I will do as you wish my Master,
I wish the pot should be filled with poverty,
‘Cause poverty don't have liberty,
I will keep it, into the untrodden region of mind,
There's no one to see or can ever trace or find,
Angel lifted the hand and gifted with opened palm—
Shouted - -Be,      ….It is yours now, you can see,
Angel disappeared... on that morning poor appeared,
A device to rule and cheat— is the only poverty,
Since then—It became the ruling system-continues
Tell me—Who will eradicate the poverty and why?"
2202,Emotion,PovertyPoemsPovertyIsDisguisePoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"Poverty is disguise in blessings
In the sense it has essential feature of tracing
Happiness and joy to which his fortune might lay
And that may keep his spirit up to find the way
Many might have experienced it and felt the burden
With long and hard struggle they might have overcome even
Yet that deep scar and challenges remind everyday
That life is formidable task to overcome and have the sway
The first challenge comes from social environment
You face rough weather from own people with unbearable comments
“See that poor family living barely from hand to mouth “
“They have no social standing”so on and so forth
This is one of saddest stage that makes human being to struggle more
Strong resolves to survive and continue to work hard therefore
With only one aim in life to overcome poverty
And bring the family at par with the blessings from almighty
“No seasons remain permanent” the legendary saying goes on
“Ups and down” in life vanishes the moment fortune makes turn
The opportunity lays open and final score is made
Life smiles at individual and excels in trade
We hear and read successive stories
How big and successful people had faced miseries?
How had they overcome and what was the inspiration?
This all makes us to strive hard and remain in race without any question"

Freedom in our land not has enough work,
Freedom in our land creates the lazy cowards,
Freedom in our land not worth to have power of people,
Believe me that we are free to do anything that could,
Walking through the streets to find out the meaning,
Of acquired freedom that we have to materialize nothing.
What a rush is this, human have no direction to go towards,
What a mad rat race is it, that human take part in it,
What a planner are these people,
who neglect the people in their planning,
What type of freedom is it that put,
minds of people in the prison of poverty?"

They speak about it.
Pizza! burgers! chicken! meat!

I don't know what 'over weighting' is!
I just know what 'skinny' is

My food is great, wonderful!
Eating this way needs no rule
I won't eat anything instead
Here it is; water & bread!
Last night doctor told my dad:
'your child needs some protein'
But  dad needs his money for
Some more drug & heroin.
We were penniless, dad was sad.

2207,Emotion,PovertyPoemsSonnetPovertyPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"The horrific specter called Poverty,
Ruining most illustrious of men;
Denying them much of their liberty;
Suppressing talents and scholastic ken.
The snow-balling avalanche that kills man,
Great scholars, scientists, poets, genius;
Putting them to death in her lion’s den,
Humiliation caused by an empty purse!
Oh, how the nightmare can affect these minds!
Sucking the sap of life in a few years;
Perpetually haunting them, it binds
To destroy sometimes, the souls of some seers.
Poverty generates great Poetry!
How can man live by writing poems free?"
2208,Emotion,PovertyPoemsPovertyAndPovertyPoembyAbdulWahab,"Poverty is like an iron cover with several holes in it
Through which pass some invisible rays
They fall upon you and you slowly go dry
When they slyly suck up the sap of your body and brain
You cannot move as the cover works like chain
And cannot think big and pose as brilliant either
Within this dome like structure the space is too less
Deflated you look and feel like a fallen flower
Yet you cannot do anything to bring a relief of rain
The invisible rays act like dykes
To make obstacles after obstacles
In the way to break away the walls of this prison room."

2210,Emotion,PovertyPoemsApostropheToPovertyPoembyMakarandParanjape,"Poverty is not so easy to attain.
It is not all misery-belly-pinching brats,
motherless, naked and dirty, let loose
among garbage heaps on squalid streets;
it is not always a toothless importunate hag,
shrunken and gaunt, who, accosting you on the footpath,
clings and clings, pleading she has no other refuge;
it is not always the slum in Calcutta or Bombay
where during the monsoon, the pus of the city
oozes, and women, with babies at their breasts
wade across filthy gutters by the roadside
to reach their dissolute hovels; it is not always
some leper on display, limbs arranged on a cart,
a wrinkled begging bowl of tin balanced between
stubs of arms, pushed by his bandaged companion.
We, for whom poverty is the only sin,
miss the true meaning of what it is to be poor.
Regard myself in my own comfortable cage
twenty concrete floors above the common street
surrounded by my solacing clutter of machines:
my washers, dryers, heaters, coolers, mixers,
air-conditioners, refrigerators, cookers, grinders,
dish washers, vacuum cleaners, hi-fi stereos, CD-Roms-
wonderful possessions, too numerous to mention-
fabricate my secure and happy delusions.  My day
which ended with a sedative, begins with the alarm
of a chronometer made in Japan.  Wired to a shaver,
I adjust temperatures, turn on the coffee maker,
automatically dispose garbage, receive recorded messages
from the office, blip the tube for the Morning News,
open refrigerator, collect dishes from the washer,
breakfast instantly, and if not constipated, defecate,
shower, shampoo, condition, blow-dry hair, dress,
descend in the elevator to my automobile, waiting
in the bowels of the building.  After I leave,
the fluffy carpet smothers the floor, bolted windows
preserve the air-conditioning; pets, and potted plants
on display, strategically placed for effect, languish
for want of sunshine and air.
Regard myself among
all these, my indispensable possessions.  Can I
one muffled night, walk away from all this that ties me?
can I, oppressed by my fears and uncertainties,
disappear into the night to find all the answers?
'I shall not rest until I have found the truth'-
can I take such a vow and simply leave in the dark
without even a note, as over two thousand years ago
Gautama did?  With all my engagements, can I
without notice, even take a vacation?  No, impossible.
I will be registered with the Missing Persons Bureau.
The media will blare my absence; the major newspapers
announcing a reward for my capture, will print my
picture; my wife will hire detectives to track me down,
and if I am found, she will probably file for divorce,
suing me for desertion and maltreatment.  Afterwards,
endless alimony payments will follow as a matter of course.
No, my friend, even if I want to, I cannot be poor.
Poverty, the plain fact is, cannot be inherited;
it has to be acquired, for it is a quality of the mind.
Poverty is the lack of need, not the want of possessions.
It cannot be forced, because it is voluntary.
He who knows what it is to be poor, always walks
upright; using only what he needs, refusing all excesses,
he is the essential man, without any superfluity.
Or, consider another angle:
we humans are beings of spirit and flesh.
some stuff the spirit, starve the flesh,
some starve the spirit and stuff the flesh.
Some die of too little, some die of too much,
and all those who die are equal.  Hence,
privation and repletion are variations
of the same illness.  So don't think that
being rich, in itself, is better than being poor,
for in the ultimate analysis, despite your wealth,
can you deny, that in truth you own only yourself?
Beyond a certain point,
I do not care to prolong this argument.
These words formed in indignation
always dissolve in a calm beyond comment.
My philosophy is simple
though some consider it partisan and limited:
the poor define their opposites;
without them none would be rich.
Hence, if nothing else,
let me here declare
my allegiance to my deprived countrymen,
however unlike them I may be.
Let poverty be my lot,
let me make this meagre offering
at the shrine of indigence.
Having now come out into the open,
taken sides for the rest of my days,
let me end,
on a note of uncharacteristic bluntness:
we mustn't extend our judgements
to what we do not comprehend;
we should accept each other,
as we are—rich or poor-
or mind our own business, please.

As a subject and object

Could only be stepped in

Pricked at the wind,

That all the lord of our fortunes bought

Was poverty grass.
Poverty grass
The paupered seed
So sickly poor, alas;
The souls of the great untamed grow weak
Despair
On poverty grass.
And you, my friend,
Grew sick awhile,
And cried and cried, alas;
While I grew fat on a flowering weed
Called pride
And poverty grass.
And when you left
The field to me
I almost died, alas;
For I was left in a fallow field
Piled high
In poverty grass.
Wild horses we
Pricked at the wind,
Never to know, alas;
That all the lord of our fortunes bought
For us

Creating in some indecision, caused by man’s worldly religion.
While many recognize The Lord, by many, God is just ignored,
And all following Jesus Christ, become rich in this present life,
But, all who choose to ignore, God, will remain spiritually poor,
Giving rise to spiritual poverty, along with a spiritual prosperity.
There’re men who go to church, week after week as they perch,
Within their very favorite pew, but, never have been born anew,
Hearing those they espouse, thinking there are in God’s house,
Empty sermons are all they preach, as Truth they do not teach.

Falling away, into apostasy, becoming impoverished spiritually;
The poor shall always be friend, until this Age comes to an end,
As true riches all believers see, when with God we enter Eternity.

INTRODUCTION
There are so many different tools that have been thought relevant in people’s developmental projects both at individual and societal levels. Education is one of such practical tools. Importantly to note, there are also various meanings that denote the broad term ‘education’. In this essay, however, we are mainly interested in defining formal education since our discussion will dwell much on it. According to Nwomonoh (1998) , formal education is the process of gaining knowledge, attitudes, information and skills during the course of life especially at school.
Though education is said to be so instrumental in human development but also in the revamping of world economies, it is very unfortunate that education systems, world wide, are being held to ransom all because of poverty at both governmental and household levels. According to Thibault (2009) , poverty means the shortage of common things such as food, clothing, shelter and safe drinking water, all of which determine our quality of life. It may also include lack of access to opportunities like education and employment which aid the escape of poverty.
Problems in our society are interconnected in one way or the other, just like poverty and personal family problems affect a student’s capability to learn. Improving education entails improving the living conditions of students. Having in mind that education is basically responsible for the development of many countries including Malawi, as the back ground suggests, we cannot afford to bypass such a vital element without a mention. Considering also the fact that poverty is one of the forces that come in the way; blocking the success of education, we feel it rational to look at how the two realities, education and poverty, affect each other both positively and negatively. That is also why we are convinced that this topic is worth studying. Our awareness of this source, poverty, and its impact on education will enable us devise some proper measures of intervention with the hope of minimizing the negative impact of poverty on education. This point, in short, explains the purpose of our investigation and why we are so passionate in getting into this research. During the whole discussion we are being guided by two questions thus, ‘does poverty really affect education? And if it does, what points do we have on the positive and negative impacts of poverty on education? ’
METHODOLOGY
The study was basically qualitative in approach because of the nature of the issue that was being addressed. This was the case because the issue of how poverty affects education, both positively and negatively is particularly very difficult to predict the conclusions without penetrating into the core of the issue. For instance, one may unreasonably rush into concluding that poverty affects education negatively only and we cannot even dare to speak of poverty affecting education positively. The study was conducted in three schools namely; Mulunguzi, Masongola and Chirunga Private Secondary schools in Zomba district between 24th April and 3rd May. In this research we used both government and private funded schools to have a more balanced result on how poverty affects formal education in these different institutions. The information required for the study was collected through group interviews of form three students and individual interviews with teachers using semi-structured interview schedules. We opted to use these interviews in the first place because we felt books are more theoretical whereas a field research is practical and it involves real life experiences. Nevertheless, we still used desk research as a supplementary source of information and for clarity in some areas.
RESULTS
Positive impacts of poverty on education
To begin with, poverty encourages one to get educated and of course work hard in class. This is because the problems faced due to poverty are very serious and therefore students who are from poverty stricken families strive to end the problems and one of the best solutions is through education. That is to say, if a person, for instance, due to poverty, is taking just a meal in a day instead of three meals, and again if he/she is sometimes sleeping on an empty stomach, he/she will resort to education bearing in mind that if he/she gets educated they will secure formal employment and eventually be able to make ends meet for themselves as well as fending for their families.
Not only does poverty encourage one to get educated, but also it helped in the introduction of free primary education. In Malawi, for instance, when Bakili Muluzi became president, he introduced free primary education and he had eliminated the requirements for school uniform forthwith (Kadzamira & Rose,2001) . This had increased the access to education dramatically as those pupils who were coming from less privileged families were also given access to this free primary education. It should also be noted that the free primary education system was not only implemented to fulfill an electoral pledge  but also bearing in mind that some families were not able to send their children to school due to poverty. Free primary education was there to deal with illiteracy by reducing families’ direct costs of education. Again due to the influx in the number of pupils in primary schools; there was a lack of teachers. Sonani (2002) , testifies that the Ministry of Education re-employed all retired teachers below the age of 65. This also meant that the once retired teachers got back to their source of income which helped them support their families as well as hauling the economy of the country. The implementation of free primary education system in Malawi forced the government to provide infrastructures so as to accommodate the large number of pupils in these schools. Simply put, poverty had led to the introduction of free primary education which means that more children are going to school, and again more teachers are being trained and getting employed and finally the construction of school blocks culminating into infrastructural development, all these branching from poverty.
We may also look at poverty from a positive angle bearing in mind that when a country is poor more funds and donations come into it. These funds and donations are also given to the education sector to build new infrastructures and in the maintenance of already existing ones in the sector. These privileged countries also provide learning materials to schools that are poor as a result students in these less privileged schools perform well in accordance with the amount and quality of the learning materials that they have been provided with. For instance, a United States based non governmental organization known as “Water for People” handed over 44 water toilets they built to Chimwankhunda primary school. The school toilet facilities had been vandalized 11 years ago but because of poverty the school could not renovate them (Gausi,2007) .
In addition, these funds and donations help more people to get educated. This is so because people can use funds as school fees, pocket money and buy stationery. The donations may include library books, chairs and writing materials. These can make a conducive environment for one to learn since there will be enough facilities at the school. For instance, with funding from the “United States Agency for International Development” (USAID) ,3,300 needy Malawian primary school girls are being funded. They are being provided with food, clothing, school supplies and hygienic products like soap and body lotion (Muhaliwa,2005) . Likewise,500 pupils at Katoto primary school in Mzuzu no longer sit on the floors during lessons courtesy of Southern Bottlers Limited and Lions Club of Limbe. Before these funds and donations, pupils used to sit on the floor due to scarcity of desks. These donations improved the pupils’ school attendance in such a way that pupils have started going to school regularly.
In the same line, a needy student can be given a scholarship to go further with his/her education. In this case the scholarship is given to the person just because he/she cannot manage to pay school fees on her own. This in turn benefits the needy person and the community at large. In this situation poverty has assisted in the development of education in an area by beckoning funds and donations from rich countries and organisations.
Further more; in most cases poverty facilitates one’s ambitions to attain formal education. It becomes easier for a poor child to put much of his concentration on education as compared to a rich child. This is because a poverty stricken student will have less destructive materials for entertainment. He/she will also have less or no money to indulge him/herself in activities that require spending a lot of money for instance, drinking beer. Sometimes even if the child can find money he/she can buy basic needs and not just spending it anyhow. Contrast to this a rich child may obtain things like ipods, mp3s, games for entertainment. These things in most cases destruct the concentration of students in their studies. As a result, one’s class performance is negatively affected since most of his/her time is being spent on entertainment.
Negative impacts of poverty on education
Just as a coin has got two sides, a head and a tail, poverty also, apart from having positive impacts on education, it does have negative impacts on the same. We have talked much about the positive face of poverty on education. We shall surely do ourselves injustice if we do not look at the negative part. In spite of the fact that poverty has an impact on education that is worth complimenting, we cannot afford in this discussion to overlook the point that so many students have been forced to leave the corridors of learning institutions due to the same poverty. One of the reasons that force some students leave the learning institutions prematurely is pregnancy, which in most cases, come because of poverty. It is almost common knowledge that a good number of students who come from poor families wish they could be sailing in the same boat with those who come from well to do families as far as luxurious life is concerned. The poor students constantly feel that there is something missing at the core psychologically. With this feeling in their minds, they tend to regard themselves as incomplete and not accepted socially. Consequently, they envy the rich students and squarely want to posses the things that are associated with the rich students. Very unfortunate that the poor students’ parents cannot afford to fulfill their children’s desires like what the rich parents would provide. Because the pull towards recognition is too strong for the poor students to resist, they end up in indulging themselves into prostitution in their search for money. Pity indeed that instead of recreating, as anticipated, their promiscuous behavior sees most of them getting pregnant and for some very unfortunate ones get even HIV and other STIs. From this discussion, commonsense convinces us that this school dropp out due to pregnancy is one of the negative impacts of poverty on education.
Adding more flesh to this discussion, we can also appreciate that hunger has been so instrumental in bringing down the standards of education world wide, in general, and Malawi, in particular. Frankly speaking, there are very few students if not none, who concentrate on their studies on empty stomachs. Food is one of the basic needs that every person is obliged to have if he/she is to survive.  It is not surprising, therefore, to see some students performing miserably in class simply because they have not taken enough food or they have taken none altogether. The question of hunger finds its way into the education system because the government has failed to provide adequate food in most of its boarding schools. This is poverty at governmental level. There are also some students who are not boarders but still endure the hostile reality of hunger right in their homes. This is due to poverty at household level. It is sad that poverty, both at governmental and household level, has helped in engineering the deteriorating of education standards in Malawi.
Bearing in mind that it is only the eagle that can tell us the real whisper of a cloud, we visited Masongola Secondary school with the hope of getting first hand information from the students and their teachers since they are the ones who mostly benefit or get destructed by poverty. The Masongola secondary school students and their teacher, Mr. Enock Abraham, testified to us during an interview that government’s inability to provide extra food, apart from the usual beans that the institution offers, has seen many students developing ulcers. It would sound bizarre to reason that one can attend classes whilst he/she is on a hospital bed battling with ulcers. The Masongola students further testified that most poor students who have ulcers just bow down out of the race of learning because they cannot afford to buy extra food whenever the institution is serving the students beans.
This pitiful development goes beyond the boundaries of Masongola secondary school. Mulunguzi secondary school as Mr……the head teacher at the institution testifies, has not been spared from the scourge of school dropp outs simply because the school has not been able to provide  extra or adequate food to students who cannot take what their friends take on health grounds. Needless to say this leaves the education standards in Malawi vacillating. It is a pity that though we have wrestled with this question of poverty a dozen times, we have not been successful in the battle. At one point in time, the government attempted to minimize the chances of school dropout in primary schools through its provision of porridge to pupils in the junior section. This attempt was in itself a good gesture but the government has failed to implement the initiative further in other schools that up to now have not benefited from the program.
It may not sound an exaggeration if we may say poverty has also forced a good number of students to give up their hopes of getting educated simply because they find it so difficult traveling to and from their respective schools. Lack of transport means, in short, has pushed them well towards the blink of despair as far as attaining formal education is concerned. This point speaks for itself how poverty can sometimes work on the education’s disadvantage.
As we go further with this discussion, we also appreciate the fact that the problem that mostly hinders a student’s success is inadequate resources that include; few teachers and learning materials. It must be highlighted that these problems are not only in developing countries but they may also find their way in reasonably developed countries like South Africa. In a developing country like Malawi, the education system encounters these problems because of the government’s failure to look into problems of infrastructure, capacity and availability of teaching and learning materials (Nkawike,2005) . The Muluzi government did a little if any; in as far as infrastructure is concerned. Lack of school blocks facilitated by a large number of pupils due to the introduction of the free primary education in 1994, forced pupils to have lessons under trees. In 2003, for example, lack of school blocks resulted in a tragedy at Nkomachi in Lilongwe when a tree fell onto an outdoor class, resulting in injury and deaths of pupils (Mvula & Chanika,2004) . This problem of learning materials continues till date, in all levels of the education system. According to Abraham (2009) , the school has always had shortage of learning blocks to an extent that the Physical Science and Biology laboratories are used as classrooms. There is also great shortage of books in all departments, and some departments like the technical department needs new equipment and current books which are very expensive. With this unfortunate situation we cannot anticipate good performance from Masongola secondary school.
In order to deal with these issues, the Muluzi government thought it wise to disregard the provision of learning materials in schools. Instead the Malawi School Certificate of Education (MSCE)  pass mark was reduced to ensure the success of students in their examinations. Even the director of Basic Education, Nelson Kaperemera admitted that funds intended for learning materials were servicing the debts of government at the expense of improving quality education. Instead of reducing the pass mark, the government and other stake holders should strive to improve quality of education, improve teacher salaries, and provide adequate materials and train teachers properly (Malawi News,2006) .
In developing countries like Malawi, the schools are understaffed (teaching personnel)  and they tend to be handling a large number of students for long hours. Furthermore, the teachers are subjected to meager salaries, which are even made late. The government does not seem to have the welfare of teachers at heart, for instance the education Manager for Phalombe, Enoch Ali says the district is facing a dire shortage of teachers, a situation that is contributing to low education standards. The teacher pupil ratio in Phalombe is  1: 120, whilst the recommended ratio is 1: 60 (The Nation,2006) . Due to low pay teachers resort to organizing part time classes, which demand an extra amount of money on top of the normal fees. These changes clearly affect those students who come from very poor families, as they do not receive adequate studies because of lack of money.
This does not only occur in secondary schools, but it also happens in universities. As the academic staff of the Universities go on strike because of the government’s reluctance to increase their salaries. One considers how this is supposed to retain staff in the University. As a result lecturers spend more time doing consultancies; instead of preparing lectures and doing University mandated research. If we are serious about fighting poverty, formal education is the hub of ideas to fight these problems by improving its standards (Kapasula,2008) .
Child labour is one of the major problems that contribute to school dropp out. The majority of child labour victims are children who are living in poverty. This is so because they lack basic needs, for this reason they are forced even against their will to do any kind of work in order to gain financial wealth. This, therefore, affects school attendance. Evidence of school dropp out due to child labour is found in central region where most children are being employed in estates. This region has high tobacco production. Since this crop demands a lot of work, children are at high demand because they do not claim high wages compared to adults. Research, therefore, showed that the percentage of children attending schools is lower compared to that of northern and southern region (Nyirongo,2004) . We have the case of two brothers aged between 12 and 15 who were forced to work at a tobacco farm at Mpherembe in Kasungu district, where they were receiving 150 kwacha a day due to poverty (Namangale,2005) . We can see that child labour has a great impact on education because through it, a lot of children are being deprived of their right to education as they spend most of their time working.
In addition to that,  Chirwa (2003)   found out that child labour is also taking place in people’s houses. In this case children are forced to dropp out of school either by parents or on their own, to work in neighbouring homes. Here one of the victims is a 12 year old girl Elizabeth Chalimba, who left school when she was in standard six to work as a nanny in order to support her siblings.  Children from low income families are at risk because though school is their only hope for a better future, they dropp out because their parents are failing to provide them with basic needs. Apart from child labour, psychological problems due to poverty is also another cause of school dropp outs. Research shows that the impact of poverty is greater on children as opposed to adults. Firstly, the problem arises due  to the environment in which these children are raised.  These environments being impoverished, they are intellectually unstimulating, and lack of stimulation results in impaired intellectual development of a child. This in turn contributes to failure in class which can later on lead to school dropp out.
Another problem comes when disadvantaged children are at school, they fail to understand why they do not have the same access to materials as their well to do friends. All of a sudden they start considering themselves failures and that there is little they can do about their destiny. Furthermore, if in class their friends or sometimes teachers seem not to care much about them, they get disturbed emotionally. Unable to cope with these psychological and physiological needs, they react by withdrawing out of school to be at home where friends and parents show interest in them. In some cases children living in poverty do not complete their education because they lack inspiration and support from parents. These children receive either little or no inspiration and support as compared to those who come from middle or high income earning families. This is so because their parents did not go far with their education, and are not fully aware of the crucial role education plays in their children’s future. This also happens because their parents are often absent leaving no one at home to supervise or assist their children with school work.  As a result, this often affects children’s education and decreases the probability that they could go far with their studies (Weinstein,1999) .
CONCLUSION
This discussion has addressed to a greater extent problems encountered in the education sector due to poverty. While the elucidation pays more attention to the negative impacts of poverty on education, at some points it also highlights some of the positive impacts which are greatly outweighed in our discussion. Firstly, we discussed the positive impacts on education whereby; Poverty forces one to get educated by working hard, it helped in the introduction of free primary education system (in Malawi) , developed countries give funds to poor countries  and poverty gets a person away from destructive ‘social pleasures’ of the world. Afterwards, we discussed the negative impacts whereby; poverty affects a person psychologically, poor people get limited resources (food and materials) , as a result, there is an increase in dropouts and lastly the personnel in the education systems are not fully equiped by the government. These findings are very vital to secondary schools as they enable us approach the problems in those schools squarely and well prepared. After the research we also look at poverty from a perspective that would not be taken by many. Thus, after reflecting on the positive impacts of poverty on education, we tend to look at poverty as a blessing in disguise. Our awareness of whatever findings we have on the table after the investigation, will help us see where things are not well and how or what should be done to address the problems. It is only from the findings that a way for our intervention is paved to minimize the negative impact of poverty on education.
RECOMMENDANTIONS
These results can be used in Secondary schools in the following ways;
•	Schools should identify those students who are needy to receive donations.
•	Teachers should adjust their timetables or come up with make up classes to accommodate students who come from distance places.
•	Teachers or social workers should provide psychological help to students who are affected psychologically by poverty.
•	Government should provide some transport means like buses and enough learning materials.
•	Those who need special diet on health grounds should be given food that suits their condition.
•	Schools should encourage Parent-Teacher Association (PTA)  meetings to discuss the welfare of the students.

They are pushed to the social fringes the young people society disown
Ignored by the Government Bureaucracies and to the Police only known.
Who could envy them their existence those born into cruel circumstance
The Gods are completely against them of success they do not stand a chance
For them life is such a great battle they must battle their ghosts of despair
They don't even dream of the good life to them life is very unfair.
You who waffle on of life's choices with you talk is always so cheap

You would not talk of life's choices if you had to steal for to eat
If you felt alone and abandoned like the children of Poverty Street."

says this young maiden, clear and loud.
And her legs are getting leaden,
rightly sensing Armageddon.
Drags herself down to the Fountain
where a man is standing, counting
money in his fur-gloved hand,
reaching out to help her stand.
' Dear young girl, you are not well,
listen now to what I tell,
come with me up to my room
to escape your certain doom.
All the streets are full of lechers,
prostitutes and woman catchers.'
So she follows him upstairs,
seeing that perhaps he  cares.
In the light of his adobe
wrapping her into his robe,
tucks her under feather cover
but refuses to be lover,
feeds her soup with silver spoon,
lets her sleep there until noon.
As she wakes she finds a box,
filled with heavy woolen socks,
bread and cheese and also money,
then she steps into the sunny
day of her old world again.
Thinking that there must be men
who are kind and altruistic,
she herself is quite artistic.
And, on that day she finds employment,
a new life full of much enjoyment,
is waiting for her signal  'YES'
but all of it becomes a mess
when the director of her work
turns out to be a cheap old jerk.
He sees her as his latest toy
to bring her, daily, carnal joy.
That night she's back out on the street,
half-dreaming of the man she'd meet
like once before, to give her kindness,
but Lady Luck displays her blindness.
Her lips are cold and very blue,
as frost arrests the morning dew,
when at the Fountain cries disturb
her sleep, and over by the curb
he stands and waves and comes across,
her head moves in defiant toss.
But when he takes her frozen hand
she grips its warmth securely and
again they climb the creaking stairs
again she puts on hold her cares.
He sets the table and they eat,
right after stretching out their feet
toward the fireplace and savour
a burgundy with Southern flavour.
He dozes off, still in his chair
when she decides to strip and bare,
she slips into the giant bed....
that's when the waking fellow said
'Of course you may sleep in my covers,
just be aware we are not lovers.'
Behind the stove he dons pyjamas
of flannel to prevent those dramas
that happen in the heat of night,
to him this sin would not be right.
And in the morning came a cry
from the outside where chickens fly.
It was that ancient Spanish cock,
he doubles as the town's own clock.
The rooster landed on the sill
and looked inside, where, sleeping still,
they lay entangled with each other.
He shook his comb, crowed 'Poultry Mother'
and flew back down to see his flock.
He thought about the man who'd mock
his morals for a horny fling
with such a poor and raggy thing.
But then, inside his cozy den
went over to his half-dressed hen
and had his usual way with her
until the dust was just a blur,
which she enjoyed because it had
been ages since this cocky lad
had shown an interest in her charms,
she'd take him back with open arms.
Upstairs, there's  stirring in the covers,
and they awoke as newborn lovers.
Both took a vow to stay together.
And on the sill she found the feather."
2230,Emotion,PovertyPoemsPovertyAndDueToPovertyPoembyGajananMishra,"My poverty
And it is my poverty
That is making me
Weaker and weaker
O my dear, it is
My hunger that is
Making me weaker
And weaker and weaker.
I am struggling for food
All days and all nights
I have no potency to fight
Being poverty-stricken
I am unable to perform
Any activities.
O my dear, believe me,
I am always
Staying here with fear.
See me
My poverty is
Mocking at me
With so many diseases.
But I am able to
Touch the Truth and
Truth is here
Before me at this time.
As I am poor
I am hearing You and
I am fortunate to receive Your blessing
I have no other engagement other than
Calling You day and nights.
Due to my poverty I have got the real
Saintly persons as my guide and associate
And here I enjoy the purified form of life."
2231,Emotion,PovertyPoemsPovertyPoembyAbdulWahab,"I am a proud man
Not because of my wealth
But for my poverty which provides me
Lots of ideas and thoughts
And helps me to delve into my life
To fetch out some rich philosophies
And break into a way to lead a   life, contended
Without those banal luxury
Moreover I am trilled to think
That in life love and peace
Never dependent on materials
If they are in abundance or in scarcity."

Leaving it as black as the midnight sky,
Their eyes wide, white, pleading
Begging to the passersby.
They litter the street
Half naked bodies,
Red and colouring their feet
Searching for a entrance
A door out of the circle of poverty.
Poverty means destruction
Destruction means fear
Behind locked doors we sit in early evening
Too scared to see a black face
Terrified of black feet crossing the threshold.
But why be fearful of your slaves,
Those you whip and beat
Treating like the dirt from the doormat
Where you wipe your feet.
Role diversity causes poverty
Poverty destroys peace
But peace minus poverty
Means Equality should increase."
2237,Emotion,PovertyPoemsAndWhatIsPovertyPoembyGajananMishra,"And what is poverty
In which we are busy
in discussing so much?
Is not poverty lacking of faith?
Has it some friend and
if yes who are they?
We are fully aware
poverty is nothing
But a mental status
So long as we are telling
we have brain,
Let the brain in its way.
And we are in our world
With every richness with us."
2238,Emotion,PovertyPoemsPovertyPoembyKaziNazrulIslam,"O poverty, thou hast made me great.
Thou hast made me honoured like Christ
With his crown of thorns. Thou hast given me
Courage  to reveal all. To thee I owe
My insolent, naked eyes and sharp tongue.
Thy curse has turned my violin to  a sword.
O proud saint, thy terrible fire
Has rendered my heaven barren.
It has prematurely dried beauty.
My feelings and my life.
Time and again I stretched my lean, cupped hands
To accept the gift of the beautiful.
But those hungry ones always came before me.
And did snatch it away ruthlessly,
Now my word of imagination is
Dry as a vast desert.
And my own beautiful!
My yellow-stalked pensive desire
Wants to blossom like the fragrant shefali.
But thou cruel one
Dost ruthlessly break the soft stalk
As the woodcutter chopsthe branches
Off the trees. My heart  grows tender
Like the autumn morning
It fills with love
Like the dew-laden earth.
But thou art the blazing sun
And thy fiery heart dries up the tiny dropp of the earth
I grow listless in the shadowy skirt of the earth
And my dreams of beauty and goodness vanish!
With a bitter tongue thou askest,
'What's the use of nectar?
It has no sting, no intoxication, no madness it.
The search for heaven's secred drink
Is not for the in this sorrow-filled earth.
Thou art the serpent, born in pai.
Thou will sit in the bower of thorns
And weave the garland of flowers.
I put on thy forehead the sing
Of suffering and woe.'
So I sing, I weave a garland,
While my throat is on fire,
And my serpent daughter bites me all over!
O unforgiving Durbasha! thou wanderest
From door to door with thy beggar's bowl.
Thou goes to the peaceful abode of
Some sleeping happy couple
And sternly callest, 'O fool,
Knowest thou, that this earth is not anybody's
Pleasure bower for luxury adn ease.
Here is sorrow and separation
And a hundred wants and disease.
Under the arms of the beloved
There are thorns in the bed,
And now must thou prepare
To savour these.' The unhappy home
Is shattered in a moment,
And woeful laments rend
The air. The light of joy is extinguished
And endless nights descends.
Thou walkest the road alone
Lean, hungry and starved.
Suddenly some sight makes thy eyebrows
Arch in annoyance and thine eyes
Blazeforth-fires of anger!
And lo! famine, pestilence and tornado
Visit the country, pleasuregarden burn,
Palaces tumble, thy law
Knows nothing but death and destruction.
Nor for thee the license of courtesy.
Thou seekest the unashaamed revelation of stark nakedness.
Thou knowest no timid hesitation or polite embarrassment
Thou dost raise high the lowly head.
At thy signal the travellers on the road to death
Put round their neck the fatal noose
With cheerful smile on their faces!
Nursing the fire of perennial want in their bosom
They worship the god of death in fiendish glee!
Thou tramplest the crown of Lakshmi
Under thy feet. What tune
Dost thou want to wiring
Out of her violin? At thy touch
the music turns into criesof anguish!
Waking up in the morning Iheard yesterday
The plantive Sanai mourning those
Who had not returned yet, At home
The singer cried for them and wept bitter tears
And floating with that music the soul of the beloved
Wandered far to the distant spot
Where the love anxiously waited.
This morning I got up
And heard the Sanai again
Crying as mournfully as ever.
And the pensive Shefalika,
sad as a widow's smile,
Falls in clusters, spreading
A mild fragrance in the air.
Today the butterfly dances in restless joy
Numbing the flowers with its kisses.
And the wings of the bee
Carry the yellow of the petals,
It's body covered with honey.
Life seems to have sprung up suddenly
On all sides. Asong of welcome
Comes unconsciously to my lips
And unbidden tears spring to my eyes
Some one seems to have entwined my soul
With that of mother-earth. She comes forward
And with her dust-adorned hands
Offers me her presents.
It seems to me that she is the youngest daughter of mine,
My darling child!
But suddenly wake up with a start. O cruel saint, being my child,
Thou weepest in my home, hungry and stoned!
O my child, my darling one
I could not give thee even a dropp of milk
No right have I to rejoice.
Poverty weeps within my doors forever
As my spouse and my child.
Who will play the flute?
Where shall I get the happy smile
Of the beautiful? Where the honeyed drink
I have drunk deep the hemlock
Of bitter tears!
And still even today
I hear the mournful tune of the Sanai.
[Translation: Kabir Chowdhury  ]"
2239,Emotion,PovertyPoemsPovertyDoesntLaughPoembyMehreenMujeeb,"Fill the rivers,
With poverty’s tears,
Only then will they be filled with innocent water.
The brick that fills poverty’s throat
Should be filled with heaven’s food
Not hell’s slaughter.
Poverty’s hands should not be,
As empty as our hearts.
Their feet should not feel the piercing sand
While we rot in cars.
Poverty’s teeth are famished
Because they bite empty air,
Our teeth are stuffed with arrogance
Until our blessings with be stripped bare
In the night of hell
When guilt will crawl upon us
The worms and snakes of our sins
Will pierce venom through our selfishness
And there we will stand
Bare of all our blessings
The naked truth for the world to see
Will be paraded across poverty’s eyes
But they will not laugh."
2240,Emotion,PovertyPoemsOnOverhearingTwoArguingAboutPovertyPoembyFrancisDuggan,"I over heard two fellows arguing about poverty
Whilst I sat in the cafe drinking coffee
And in truth I could not help but overhear them
As they sat at the next table to me.
The older of the two a silver gray haired fellow
Said to rid the World of want and poverty
We would need to depose every despotic leader
But the younger bloke with him did not agree.
He said in so called wealthy societies there's want and hunger
And where affluence is poverty too abound
From here you don't walk far to see poor people
For poverty is everywhere around.
The older bloke countered but this is a free Country
And those in poverty have themselves only to blame
And if hungry people in our midst are living
Do not expect me to feel any shame
The younger man again with him did differ
Saying want is caused by those who only care
For themselves alone and their own self interest
Many must grow poorer for to make one millionaire.
I left them there in the cafe to argue
And not for me to say who is wrong or right
For both of them looked well dressed and well fed fellows
And they won't go to bed hungry tonight."
2241,Emotion,PovertyPoemsPoemAndPovertyPoembyAftabAlam,"Neither have I measured the life with coffee spoon
Nor did hips ever become a drum to beat, at noon
Cruel hunger like autumn paved the path for spring
I dreamed; for empty tummy within the poverty ring.
I measured life with tear full tumbler like a gambler
Breathe stucks up on stake and eyes and mind blur
Initially Lord gave me poverty and then thought
Now held pen with pain, for you, poems, I brought.
Whether you read or not, poems, here on poem hunter
I will write, so as to ease myself and my agony, for barter"
2242,Emotion,PovertyPoemsDanaMajhiOfKalahandiPovertyPoembyGajananMishra,"Nothing wrong has been done
By Dana Majhi of Kalahandi.
He has just taken away
On his shoulder,
The dead body of his wife.
The sweetheart of Dana Majhi,
As you know, died in TB
At the hospital.
But let me ask a question
Why you people are so much
Worried about the incidents?
It is because something
Wrong is there within you,
It is because you are enjoying
Your life, at the cost of the people
And doing no welfare acts so far.
Remember, the summum bonum of life
Is situated in the loving service
Of the people in any set up of Govt.
You are seeking happiness, true,
By employing your senses
In the modes of materialism,
And you are not satisfied.
It is true, you engage yourself
In various philanthropic and
Altruistic works and all fail to
Give you satisfaction.
It is happening only due to
Your own childish innocence,
You are by nature eternal servitor
Of the people and you are
Taking away everything from
The common men like Dana Majhi,
And knowingly and unknowingly
Not providing the basic needs."
2243,Emotion,PovertyPoemsChildrenOfPovertyPoembyMoahammadMaleki,"Arrows of poverty darting from throes
Thorns of destitution germinating from thrones
Flood of orphans sprouting on ghettos of misery
Torrents of waifs are pouring out from poverty-stricken outskirts of melancholy
Usurped future awaits them to heap upon their plights reprieved
Kingdom of agony is their permanent cottages of lights bereaved
Freezing winters and searing summers passing by
Infants of heedless justice praying with weep and cry
Begging god for walking on meadows of unceasing happiness
Yearning for unfading dreams of incessant caress
They are mere innocent victims of hostilities
Deprived of even vital facilities
Malnutrition wreaking withdrawl of stomachs on waists of threadbare bait
Refrigerators are deserts of poignant barren fate
Eradication of poverty is ridiculous mottoes of powers
We should take a determined action to raze this FATAL pestilence of populace."
2244,Emotion,PovertyPoemsThePovertyIAmSaddestAboutPoembySylviaFrancesChan,"(he shouts about politics, while we have here about poetry)
....he read that
mine poetry about this poverty
the stupidity started scolding me
declared instantly me-moi as its enemy
its words, so absurd
a lunatic so terrific
not its area nor its section
I oft write in Dutch and this is mine declaration
I do now one step lower
from ""it"" I step a bit lower down to ""his""
his profession does not read poetry
but he thought he could read
poetry poesy and poems
true very pity
not his art nor his profession
he meddles in everything
mine poetic wings, not his thing
Oft to my Queendom he comes
he thinks he could reign me
that was his greatest mistake
he thought he could read
I too thought that he could read
but....I was mistaken
mine loved friend said he loves to read
I too thought that he loves to read
it seemed so, it looked so
but....I was mistaken
after having walked amongst this poverty
I must conclude in tears and tragedy
this is the worst and most tragic comedy
I ever knew after my literal study
after he read my poetry
in the darkest café while drinking wild wine
he copied the full title of mine poetry
""Saddest about the poverty nowadays""
and instantly mailed me,
that I started talking about politics
I thought he could read poetry
but....I was mistaken
my loved one never knew
the alienating appearance of this blind male
I wrote about true poetry and its poverty
he associated with politics
once again here I repeat my last poem's title
""Saddest about the poverty nowadays""
his unwanted eyes are peeping constantly
copying my poem, the constant liar
he read mine poetry
I wrote about the poverty in poetry
instantly he started shouting about politics
just like this fake person
he has that poverty I have in mind
about vocabulary, grammar, and all that kind
I thought he could read poetry
I was mistaken
he was peeping constantly
at mine poetry
I wrote about words, nouns
the present and the past
and all the tenses
it pained all my senses
when he accused me of politics
of yelling at innocent persons
shouting at innocent poets
not mine strife in this forsaken life
I am suffering from pain
restrained
I thought he was clever
I am now mistaken forever
Oft I asked my lover
do you wish to know who he is?
he is all there darkest is, except God's Bliss
a constant stalker, an insane chatter
an aliphatic androgyne appearance
this is the biggest difference….

2245,Emotion,PovertyPoemsWhatIsPovertyPoembyMarilynLott,"What does poverty really entail?
How bad does it have to get?
For some a bad economy
Is poverty from where they sit
But if you look back to hard times
During the early years
It’s not having a home to live in
The hopelessness can bring tears
The Great Depression had it all
No jobs and no place to dwell
Barely enough to eat or nothing at all
These folks went through hell
Thread bare was the term for clothing
Dirt poor was a phrase as well
Looking at black and white pictures
Oh yes, you can surely tell
It’s a time when we hope God
Is able to see
That folks need His help because
They have slipped into poverty!"
2246,Emotion,PovertyPoemsSonnetOPovertyThoughFromThyHaggardEyePoembyWilliamLisleBowles,"O, Poverty! though from thy haggard eye,
Thy cheerless mien, of every charm bereft,
Thy brow that Hope's last traces long have left,
Vain Fortune's feeble sons with terror fly;
I love thy solitary haunts to seek.
For Pity, reckless of her own distress;
And Patience, in her pall of wretchedness,
That turns to the bleak storm her faded cheek;
And Piety, that never told her wrong;
And meek Content, whose griefs no more rebel;
And Genius, warbling sweet her saddest song;
And Sorrow, listening to a lost friend's knell,
Long banished from the world's insulting throng;
With thee, and thy unfriended offspring, dwell."
2247,Emotion,PovertyPoemsPovertyPoembyThomasTraherne,"As in the house I sate,
Alone and desolate,
No creature but the fire and I,
The chimney and the stool, I lift mine eye
Up to the wall,
And in the silent hall,
Saw nothing mine
But some few cups and dishes shine,
The table and the wooden stools
Where people used to dine;
A painted cloth there was,
Wherein some ancient story wrought
A little entertained my thought,
Which light discovered through the glass.
I wondered much to see
That all my wealth should be
Confined in such a little room,
Yet hope for more I scarcely durst presume.
It grieved me sore
That such a scanty store
Should be my all;
For I forgot my ease and health,
Nor did I think of hands or eyes,
Nor soul nor body prize;
I neither thought the sun,
Nor moon, nor stars, nor people mine,
Though they did round about me shine;
And therefore was I quite undone.
Some greater things, I thought,
Must needs for me be wrought,
Which till my craving mind could see
I ever should lament my poverty;
I fain would have
Whatever bounty gave,
Nor could there be
Without or love or deity;
For should not he be infinite
Whose hand created me?
Ten thousand absent things
Did vex my poor and wanting mind,
Which, till I be no longer blind,
Let me not see the King of kings.
His love must surely be
Rich, infinite, and free;
Nor can he be thought a God
Of grace and power, that fills not his abode,
His holy court,
In kind and liberal sort;
Joys and pleasures,
Plenty of jewels, goods, and treasures,
To enrich the poor, cheer the forlorn,
His palace must adorn,
And given all to me;
For till his works my wealth became,
No love or peace did me inflame:
But now I have a Deity."

O, blame me not if I no more can write!
Look in your glass, and there appears a face
That overgoes my blunt invention quite,
Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.
Were it not sinful then striving to mend,
To mar the subject that before was well?
For to no other pass my verses tend

Your own glass shows you when you look in it."

It haunts me, and part of me wants to make a change and,
the other me wants to forget
but I can surely bet
It’s something one with a good heart wouldn’t do!
If it takes some sacrifice, I’m ready
But is the rest of the world?
I see poverty in a rich man trying to find love,
I see poverty in a well-educated man who lacks modesty.
I see poverty in a literate man who lacks respect for poor.
I see poverty in a selfish man who wants more
The world is still imperfect despite all the advancements,
Because there is,
Poverty."
2253,Emotion,PovertyPoemsAboutPovertyPoembyGajananMishra,"We are proud to say we are poor
We are telling about our poverty
We are getting nowhere.
We want to help the poor
By eliminating them from this geography
Basically we know not anything.
Giving the poor free rice free vegetables
Free fruits free clothing free house and food bill
What we want to do we know not, it is but to kill.
Know the poor know poverty all around the world
Come to their rescue care for the common poor people
No show nothing, no hypocrisy would help anybody."
2254,Emotion,PovertyPoemsPovertyIsAGiftPoembyMarkHeathcote,"Father, poverty is a gift
Ask any bird taking a rain bath.
Son, don't make's me laugh
There's nothing but rain
Poverty isn't a gift
There's nothing but pain.
So son fastens your reigns
Ride for them riches today
Don't live by wage's daily
Paid only once monthly
Father poverty is a gift.
Son nothing is ever enough,
Just ask your mum."
2255,Emotion,PovertyPoemsLivingLargeInPovertyPoembyNadaliaBagratuni,"All things being equal I'd rather be rich,
However, thing don't always work out,
So I'm resigned to spend my time in poverty,
Working in the dirt and grime.
Why, or why me Lord, I may ask,
Gently proding the almighty for just one task,
I wondered if it would be possible,
Just bless me temporarily the ability to pay my bills,
Then I will be a changed fellow.
I then figured then that money was my problem.
What I didn't realize then,
But I do now,
It isn't a matter of money,
It is a matter of know how.
Now matter how you work,
You may never get ahead,
And then there are people who just work themselves dead.
I looked in the mirror and then decided,
Give me the poverty,
And all I need is the serenity,
To be able to live comfortably,
Now, I live with my means,
Not wanting for things,
And I'm very happy.
You may ask, what did I learn?
I will say, ' Living in poverty is not so bad,
Especially if you have a rich dad! '"
2256,Emotion,PovertyPoemsARoomWherePovertyVisitedPoembySutputraRadheye,"A room I saw
where the babu of poverty had been a frequent visitor
few walls were stark naked as if they never wore anything
and a few were shedding away the color they were draped in
The room had nothing in it
no furniture, nothing much to address as wearable,
a small blanket was there with dust marks and small holes
which seemed at least two decades old
and must've at some point been the food of rats roaming around
As I looked around I found
a few broken, rusted kitchenware kept in a corner,
a clay pot to store water which was dripping from the roof
so that for drinking it can be used
The room was like a cell allotted to criminals
hardly you can find an entrance for the air
the smoke coming out of the beedi that the man
in lungi was inhaling was all it had to offer....
He was coughing, spitting in the broken bucket he had
there was no sign of sunshine even when it was 12 at noon on my watch,
food looked like a distant visitor to his house
it seemed, it liked the dustbin of a rich more than the stomach of a poor
His eyes told me a story
a story that I can never forget, when my eyes met his
of broken bodies and shattered dreams
of a frustrated soul and fractured beliefs
I could easily sense his disbelief in Gods
not a single image of idol was there in the entire room
Bhagavad Gita and Quraan too were invisible to my eyes
maybe because God didn't come to save his family when corruption ate it alive?
It was then when Kareem ran in saying
'Chacha jaan, MLA sahab has come to our slum...'
But no, he didn't move an inch
instead, he just blabbered something in muffled voice
and then lit another beedi up,
it seemed as if he knew all the tactics of these white dacoits...
He was all alone now
with wrinkled face and hands that trembled,
no longer could he pull a rickshaw or clean a garden,
what he could only do is to count the beads of the rosary of death...

2257,Emotion,PovertyPoemsPovertyPoembyrameshrai,"Poverty is the curse of life
but some time it is gift for life
if you have no car
you cover your distance
on foot or by public means
you have no mobile phone
you are saved
from unnecessary calls
and will save time
but now-a-days
every one has got
Due to lack of money
you can not take rich food
you are saved from unforeseen disease
like sugar, high blood pressure etc.
if you have enough money
you will always be thinking
for better investment
you can hardly spare your time
to attend church, temple, mosque etc
you will be deprived
from attachment of God
if you have money
more than your requirement
donate humbly and generously
for charity
Money is the means
not the matter
do not run behind money
let the money run behind you.

2258,Emotion,PovertyPoemsPovertyPoembySEGUNRASAKI,"The entity that is dreaded by all but ever present everywhere, a non-respecter of age,
Poverty does not have regard for race, nor nationality, as it is present in every part of the globe,
Poverty breeds diseases, it has siblings like misery, ignorance, illiteracy, dejection, rejection, degradation, agony,
Poverty means the  difference between haves and have-nots,  the rich and the poor, the upper and the lower class,
Poverty is a quick destroyer of human as it makes people ‘sell' lots of things including conscience, and destroys self-esteem,
Poverty, what a curse that has a spectrum; from mild, relative, to abject poverty,
Poverty is a monster that destroys families, communities and societies, always a bad commodity in the market place,
Poverty determines how you get treated by the society, and you are loathed for your status,
Poverty gets written all over you once you are in the lower class, caste system in every society is a celebration and endorsement of poverty as social classification,
Some societies believe you are born into poverty and you should be in poverty for life, please ask who is a 'Dalit' in Asia,
Poverty makes people call you 'Church rat', the basics of everyday living become luxuries to the poor,
Poverty robs you of dignity, it robs you of a chance to be heard, as ‘ no good ideas come from the poor',
Poverty in father, poverty in mother, definitely rubs off on the children, poverty is a disease difficult to cure,
Poverty is a giant monster that can only be tamed by dedicated hard-work, prayers as Jabez did, and may seem un-surmountable, may be intimidating, but can be defeated,
Every mother discusses poverty with her kids, how terrible and merciless of a character is poverty,
Poverty is the character every father tells its fairy tale and the importance of using education as weapon to attack it,
Poverty an equal opportunity degrader of a person, multiple acronyms have been given to poverty in every culture and society."
2259,Emotion,PovertyPoemsPovertyPoembyLayaBajpai,"There's smoke in the air
I walk stupefied;
For, I just witnessed a horrendous sight.
A thin, weakling child, clinging to an equally young mother.
I wonder at God's justice,
To the well-fed, he does not give children and to this beggarly girl (I couldn't muster strength enough to call her a woman) a child at such a young age!
Why O God! this disparity?
To one who cannot feed; a child at such a young age, and to those who can give all the joys of this world,
No children."
2260,Emotion,PovertyPoemsPovertyAndMisrulePoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"Poverty and misrule
Wolves are same all over
You need to think it over
Liberty and freedom
Go together seldom
Under the same name
People gang up to come
In power and try to rule
Rest all people watch them as fool
Poor shall suffer more
As restrictions shall not be over
Their freedom of expression shall remain on paper
They will remain free but facing starvation and hunger
Africa has natural sources in abundance
Now you have got chance
Rise above pretty considerations
And exert pressure as an independent nation
If no resistance is offered
Or awareness is created
You shall be kept under control
To face poverty and misrule"
2261,Emotion,PovertyPoems21VictorianPovertyPoembynicolaburkett,"A period of extreme poverty of the lower working classes
As they worked to the death the rich sat politely on their arses
London’s poor tried to scrape a living doing jobs the devil created
As the rich sat at their windows laughing at the pitiful souls they hated
The poor would have sooner died than enter the poor houses control
As it was not fit to harbor a single living human soul
Small boys were used to clean narrow sooted chimneys
While in the coal mines children worked on their hands and knees
Although this golden age pioneered many useful inventions
Children privileged to go to school were whipped instead of detentions
And as the poor worked for a life at every waking hour
The rich covered their stench with perfume and wild flowers
The poor had nothing and hardly anything to eat
While the rich enjoyed tea and honey and sherbet lemon sweets
In Victorian London the poor just lived and died
The rich never really noticed the rich never really cried
A period of extreme poverty of the lower working classes
As they worked to the death the rich sat politely on their asses"

2264,Emotion,PovertyPoemsPovertyPoembyGangadharannairPulingat,"Eradication of poverty all over the world
A must and justice to the people
Poverty is not at all a curse or to blame
It is surely the system's failure in sharing.
Poverty the most dreaded thing to experience
To a thinking mind to live without food
Or to the barest minimum of necessities
where it is denied is a cruel thing to experience
Blame the world of poverty and try for corrections
Share the resources to such an equality
At least for two square meals a day
And minimum necessities that humans want
Respect the human being and its dignity all over
Surely poverty is the most objectionable thing
The confidence of life losing in its bottom lines
The unhelpful society accuses the poverty as fate.
The world is so improved in living conditions
But the system  in sharing is rotten and old
Change those inequalities in perfect peace
Allowing the human life more possibilities and change.
Life is short and human life is precious
Only the world order can save the humans
The world is fully capable to look after
If there is a perfect world with change of mind
Contentment, kindness, and humanity be preserved."

2267,Emotion,PovertyPoemsAliceFellOrPovertyPoembyWilliamWordsworth,"THE post-boy drove with fierce career,
For threatening clouds the moon had drowned;
When, as we hurried on, my ear
Was smitten with a startling sound.
As if the wind blew many ways,
I heard the sound,-and more and more;
It seemed to follow with the chaise,
And still I heard it as before.
At length I to the boy called out;
He stopped his horses at the word,
But neither cry, nor voice, nor shout,
Nor aught else like it, could be heard.
The boy then smacked his whip, and fast
The horses scampered through the rain;
But, hearing soon upon the blast
The cry, I bade him halt again.
Forthwith alighting on the ground,
'Whence comes,' said I, 'this piteous moan?'
And there a little Girl I found,
Sitting behind the chaise, alone.
'My cloak!' no other word she spake,
But loud and bitterly she wept,
As if her innocent heart would break;
And down from off her seat she leapt.
'What ails you, child?'-she sobbed 'Look here!'
I saw it in the wheel entangled,
A weather-beaten rag as e'er
From any garden scare-crow dangled.
There, twisted between nave and spoke,
It hung, nor could at once be freed;
But our joint pains unloosed the cloak,
A miserable rag indeed!
'And whither are you going, child,
To-night alone these lonesome ways?'
'To Durham,' answered she, half wild-
'Then come with me into the chaise.'
Insensible to all relief
Sat the poor girl, and forth did send
Sob after sob, as if her grief
Could never, never have an end.
'My child, in Durham do you dwell?'
She checked herself in her distress,
And said, 'My name is Alice Fell;
I'm fatherless and motherless.
'And I to Durham, Sir, belong.'
Again, as if the thought would choke
Her very heart, her grief grew strong;
And all was for her tattered cloak!
The chaise drove on; our journey's end
Was nigh; and, sitting by my side,
As if she had lost her only friend
She wept, nor would be pacified.
Up to the tavern-door we post;
Of Alice and her grief I told;
And I gave money to the host,
To buy a new cloak for the old.
'And let it be of duffil grey,
As warm a cloak as man can sell!'
Proud creature was she the next day,
The little orphan, Alice Fell!"
2268,Emotion,PovertyPoemsTheStingOfPovertyPoembyWalterreanSalley,"It has no joy—
No bells to ring.
No songs for
The heart to sing.
Dawn to dawn,
It plagues the poor,
With relief—
Nevermore.
It doesn’t give,
But rather takes—
Leaving victims
In its wake.
It gives no peace
And little sleep.
And drains the faith
Until it’s weak.
Hunger seems
To be its trend.
Will such stigma
Never end?
And always,
There's uncertainty,
But such is the way
Of poverty."
2269,Emotion,PovertyPoemsLinesInditedWithAllTheDepravityOfPovertyPoembyOgdenNash,"One way to be very happy is to be very rich
For then you can buy orchids by the quire and bacon by the flitch.
And yet at the same time People don't mind if you only tip them a dime,
Because it's very funny
But somehow if you're rich enough you can get away with spending
water like money
While if you're not rich you can spend in one evening your salary for
the year
And everybody will just stand around and jeer.
If you are rich you don't have to think twice about buying a judge or a
horse,
Or a lower instead of an upper, or a new suit, or a divorce,
And you never have to say When,
And you can sleep every morning until nine or ten,
All of which
Explains why I should like very, very much to be very, very rich."

Who seldom eat sweet honey,
as long as there are sisters
under prostitution's malady,

abuse and exploitation by many
and as long as there are disaster
jeopardizing life and property.
Poverty is a  war and disaster
Hounting every nation today
that can't be won by a leader
without the help of everybody
as it is a war arm with disaster

2274,Emotion,PovertyPoemsPassionatePovertyPoembyJohnSensele,"Poverty seems like a repellent stuck on the poor
Whose only fault lies in owning no property or asset to parade
Among wealth admirers and worshippers to whom poverty seems dour
In contexts where ostentatious display of wealth cuts the grade
That profligacy and extravagance attract
Robbing the poor of the dignity glitter
As though on purpose fleas of poverty they contract
Dumping ugliness on the poor on whom fruits of affluence litter
Dwindling humanness and affection which wealth simpleton conflate
Into little human worth and warmth
Where spooks of poverty deflate
In proportion to the increase in affluence sloth
Sown, grown and thrown with utter scorn
To belittle
Abject poverty misguided affluence thinkers warn
Amounting to little less than spittle
Poverty peels off humbug and complacency
Exposing deeper layers of flawed humanity
Denuded of perspicacity and sagacity
Sometimes concealed in the deficit of humility
That often mars circles of affluence
Where possession seems to epitomise human dignity
Mistakenly regarded as diluted influence
The poor exert in extolling human unity shorn of wealth affinity and motility."
2275,Emotion,PovertyPoemsPovertyAndWealthPoembyEllaWheelerWilcox,"The stork flew over a town one day,
And back of each wing an infant lay;
One to a rich man’s home he brought,
And one he left at a labourer’s cot.
The rich man said, ‘My son shall be
A lordly ruler o’er land and sea.’
The labourer sighed, ‘’Tis the good God’s will
That I have another mouth to fill.’
The rich man’s son grew strong and fair,
And proud with the pride of a millionaire.
His motto in life was, ‘Live while you may, ’
And he crowded years in a single day.
He bought position and name and place,
And he bought him a wife with a handsome face.
He journeyed over the whole wide world,
But discontent his heart lay curled
Like a serpent hidden in leaves and moss,
And life seemed hollow and gold was dross.
He scoffed at woman, and doubted God,
And died like a beast and went back to the sod.
The son of the labourer tilled the soil,
And thanked God daily for health and toil.
He wedded for love in his youthful prime,
And two lives chorded in tune and time.
His wants were simple, and simple his creed,
To trust God fully: it served his need,
And lightened his labour, and helped him to die
With a smile on his lips and a hope in his eye.
When all is over and all is done,
Now which of these men was the richer one?"

expression
birds coming out from our mouths
butterflies from our
stomachs
fireworks from our minds
in multicolors
to the darkest skies
of this earth
where can poverty
be
in a world of freedom: to say what you want to say
to think what you want to think
to dream
to imagine
to find meanings where others think there are none?
the secret garden
a path
a gate
a hiding place for all of us who still believe
about life
and aftelife and life after life
temporary deaths
and temporary losses
a jump a leap to the world beyond us
to eternity

this i think is poetry and surely
there can never be

Poverty is purely man made
So it has to be eradicated from its root
The society afflicted with poverty
Is reprehension of entire human society
Corruption is the source of poverty
Only a fearless society can be said
Free from all poverty
Where the people are dumb and discounted
Poverty exists there
Poverty shows, how many immature  person
Rule the country
Poverty is the reason for all philosophical end."

To keep you in power.

2283,Emotion,PovertyPoemsPovertyPoembyJaneTaylor,"I saw an old cottage of clay,
And only of mud was the floor;
It was all falling into decay,
And the snow drifted in at the door.
Yet there a poor family dwelt,
In a hovel so dismal and rude;
And though gnawing hunger they felt,
They had not a morsel of food.
The children were crying for bread,
And to their poor mother they’d run;
‘Oh, give us some breakfast,’ they said,
Alas! their poor mother had none.
She viewed them with looks of despair,
She said (and I’m sure it was true),
‘’Tis not for myself that I care,
But, my poor little children, for you.’
O then, let the wealthy and gay
But see such a hovel as this,
That in a poor cottage of clay
They may know what true misery is.
And what I may have to bestow
I never will squander away,
While many poor people I know
Around me are wretched as they."
2284,Emotion,PovertyPoemsTheLadyPovertyPoembyEvelynUnderhill,"I met her on the Umbrian hills,
Her hair unbound, her feet unshod:
As one whom secret glory fills
She walked, alone with God.
I met her in the city street:
Oh, changed was all her aspect then!
With heavy eyes and weary feet
She walked alone, with men."

As surrounded by wall stay you,
So you do not take any step
You only stay in your pomp.

If I would acquire wealth, with it a name
Now I pass by my friends of old
They are as strangers, as my feelings are cold
Money has spoiled my heart of flesh
And has relinquished the warmth that was once fresh
Now as I grow old and start to reflect
I realize my mistakes, but can no longer connect
And for this I weep, for when all has been said
What I have been left, is no better than one dead"

Your Riches—taught me—Poverty.
Myself—a Millionaire
In little Wealths, as Girls could boast
Till broad as Buenos Ayre—
You drifted your Dominions—
A Different Peru—
And I esteemed All Poverty
For Life's Estate with you—
Of Mines, I little know—myself—
But just the names, of Gems—
The Colors of the Commonest—
And scarce of Diadems—
So much, that did I meet the Queen—
Her Glory I should know—
But this, must be a different Wealth—
To miss it—beggars so—
I'm sure 'tis India—all Day—
To those who look on You—
Without a stint—without a blame,
Might I—but be the Jew—
I'm sure it is Golconda—
Beyond my power to deem—
To have a smile for Mine—each Day,
How better, than a Gem!
At least, it solaces to know
That there exists—a Gold—
Altho' I prove it, just in time
Its distance—to behold—
Its far—far Treasure to surmise—
And estimate the Pearl—
That slipped my simple fingers through—
While just a Girl at School."

Nor a dominant gene

Want is not traced

Time doesn't stay the same, nor does the world.
Time goes slow and sometimes fast, and with hope, we shall last.
Time can be lost, and it can cost.
Time can be harnessed, and it can slip through the hand like granules of sand.
Time is a friend or foe, this I know.
Time is a second, a minute, or an hour, it may devour.
Time controls and consoles.
Time, at times, is the aggressor and the lesser, a comforter.
Time heals and steals. Time brings hope and sometimes despair.
Time can repair, and it can be unfair.

My Love and I long silent stood,
Amazed that any heavens could
Decree to part us, bitterly repining.
My Love, in aimless love and grief,
Reached forth and drew aside a leaf
That just above us played the thief
And stole our starlight that for us was shining.
A star that had remarked her pain
Shone straightway down that leafy lane,
And wrought his image, mirror-plain,
Within a tear that on her lash hung gleaming.
""Thus Time,"" I cried, ""is but a tear
Some one hath wept 'twixt hope and fear,
Yet in his little lucent sphere
Our star of stars, Eternity, is beaming."""

Ancestral Houses
SURELY among a rich man s flowering lawns,
Amid the rustle of his planted hills,
Life overflows without ambitious pains;
And rains down life until the basin spills,
And mounts more dizzy high the more it rains
As though to choose whatever shape it wills
And never stoop to a mechanical
Or servile shape, at others' beck and call.
Mere dreams, mere dreams! Yet Homer had not Sung
Had he not found it certain beyond dreams
That out of life's own self-delight had sprung
The abounding glittering jet; though now it seems
As if some marvellous empty sea-shell flung
Out of the obscure dark of the rich streams,
And not a fountain, were the symbol which
Shadows the inherited glory of the rich.
Some violent bitter man, some powerful man
Called architect and artist in, that they,
Bitter and violent men, might rear in stone
The sweetness that all longed for night and day,
The gentleness none there had ever known;
But when the master's buried mice can play.
And maybe the great-grandson of that house,
For all its bronze and marble, 's but a mouse.
O what if gardens where the peacock strays
With delicate feet upon old terraces,
Or else all Juno from an urn displays
Before the indifferent garden deities;
O what if levelled lawns and gravelled ways
Where slippered Contemplation finds his ease
And Childhood a delight for every sense,
But take our greatness with our violence?
What if the glory of escutcheoned doors,
And buildings that a haughtier age designed,
The pacing to and fro on polished floors
Amid great chambers and long galleries, lined
With famous portraits of our ancestors;
What if those things the greatest of mankind
Consider most to magnify, or to bless,
But take our greatness with our bitterness?
II
My House
An ancient bridge, and a more ancient tower,
A farmhouse that is sheltered by its wall,
An acre of stony ground,
Where the symbolic rose can break in flower,
Old ragged elms, old thorns innumerable,
The sound of the rain or sound
Of every wind that blows;
The stilted water-hen
Crossing Stream again
Scared by the splashing of a dozen cows;
A winding stair, a chamber arched with stone,
A grey stone fireplace with an open hearth,
A candle and written page.
Il Penseroso's Platonist toiled on
In some like chamber, shadowing forth
How the daemonic rage
Imagined everything.
Benighted travellers
From markets and from fairs
Have seen his midnight candle glimmering.
Two men have founded here.  A man-at-arms
Gathered a score of horse and spent his days
In this tumultuous spot,
Where through long wars and sudden night alarms
His dwinding score and he seemed castaways
Forgetting and forgot;
And I, that after me
My bodily heirs may find,
To exalt a lonely mind,
Befitting emblems of adversity.
III
My Table
Two heavy trestles, and a board
Where Sato's gift, a changeless sword,
By pen and paper lies,
That it may moralise
My days out of their aimlessness.
A bit of an embroidered dress
Covers its wooden sheath.
Chaucer had not drawn breath
When it was forged.  In Sato's house,
Curved like new moon, moon-luminous
It lay five hundred years.
Yet if no change appears
No moon; only an aching heart
Conceives a changeless work of art.
Our learned men have urged
That when and where 'twas forged
A marvellous accomplishment,
In painting or in pottery, went
From father unto son
And through the centuries ran
And seemed unchanging like the sword.
Soul's beauty being most adored,
Men and their business took
Me soul's unchanging look;
For the most rich inheritor,
Knowing that none could pass Heaven's door,
That loved inferior art,
Had such an aching heart
That he, although a country's talk
For silken clothes and stately walk.
Had waking wits; it seemed
Juno's peacock screamed.
IV
My Descendants
Having inherited a vigorous mind
From my old fathers, I must nourish dreams
And leave a woman and a man behind
As vigorous of mind, and yet it seems
Life scarce can cast a fragrance on the wind,
Scarce spread a glory to the morning beams,
But the torn petals strew the garden plot;
And there's but common greenness after that.
And what if my descendants lose the flower
Through natural declension of the soul,
Through too much business with the passing hour,
Through too much play, or marriage with a fool?
May this laborious stair and this stark tower
Become a roofless min that the owl
May build in the cracked masonry and cry
Her desolation to the desolate sky.
The primum Mobile that fashioned us
Has made the very owls in circles move;
And I, that count myself most prosperous,
Seeing that love and friendship are enough,
For an old neighbour's friendship chose the house
And decked and altered it for a girl's love,
And know whatever flourish and decline
These stones remain their monument and mine.
V
The Road at My Door
An affable Irregular,
A heavily-built Falstaffian man,
Comes cracking jokes of civil war
As though to die by gunshot were
The finest play under the sun.
A brown Lieutenant and his men,
Half dressed in national uniform,
Stand at my door, and I complain
Of the foul weather, hail and rain,
A pear-tree broken by the storm.
I count those feathered balls of soot
The moor-hen guides upon the stream.
To silence the envy in my thought;
And turn towards my chamber, caught
In the cold snows of a dream.
VI
The Stare's Nest by My Window
The bees build in the crevices
Of loosening masonry, and there
The mother birds bring grubs and flies.
My wall is loosening; honey-bees,
Come build in the empty house of the state.
We are closed in, and the key is turned
On our uncertainty; somewhere
A man is killed, or a house burned,
Yet no cleat fact to be discerned:
Come build in he empty house of the stare.
A barricade of stone or of wood;
Some fourteen days of civil war;
Last night they trundled down the road
That dead young soldier in his blood:
Come build in the empty house of the stare.
We had fed the heart on fantasies,
The heart's grown brutal from the fare;
More Substance in our enmities
Than in our love; O honey-bees,
Come build in the empty house of the stare.
VII
I see Phantoms of Hatred and of the Heart's
Fullness and of the Coming Emptiness
I climb to the tower-top and lean upon broken stone,
A mist that is like blown snow is sweeping over all,
Valley, river, and elms, under the light of a moon
That seems unlike itself, that seems unchangeable,
A glittering sword out of the east.  A puff of wind
And those white glimmering fragments of the mist sweep by.
Frenzies bewilder, reveries perturb the mind;
Monstrous familiar images swim to the mind's eye.
'Vengeance upon the murderers,' the cry goes up,
'Vengeance for Jacques Molay.' In cloud-pale rags, or in lace,
The rage-driven, rage-tormented, and rage-hungry troop,
Trooper belabouring trooper, biting at arm or at face,
Plunges towards nothing, arms and fingers spreading wide
For the embrace of nothing; and I, my wits astray
Because of all that senseless tumult, all but cried
For vengeance on the murderers of Jacques Molay.
Their legs long, delicate and slender, aquamarine their eyes,
Magical unicorns bear ladies on their backs.
The ladies close their musing eyes.  No prophecies,
Remembered out of Babylonian almanacs,
Have closed the ladies' eyes, their minds are but a pool
Where even longing drowns under its own excess;
Nothing but stillness can remain when hearts are full
Of their own sweetness, bodies of their loveliness.
The cloud-pale unicorns, the eyes of aquamarine,
The quivering half-closed eyelids, the rags of cloud or of lace,
Or eyes that rage has brightened, arms it has made lean,
Give place to an indifferent multitude, give place
To brazen hawks.  Nor self-delighting reverie,
Nor hate of what's to come, nor pity for what's gone,
Nothing but grip of claw, and the eye's complacency,
The innumerable clanging wings that have put out the moon.
I turn away and shut the door, and on the stair
Wonder how many times I could have proved my worth
In something that all others understand or share;
But O! ambitious heart, had such a proof drawn forth
A company of friends, a conscience set at ease,
It had but made us pine the more.  The abstract joy,
The half-read wisdom of daemonic images,
Suffice the ageing man as once the growing boy."
2295,Emotion,TimePoemsTheTimeWhenIFirstFellInLovePoembyAnonymous,"The time when first I fell in love,
Which now I must lament;
The year wherein I lost such time
To compass my content.
The day wherein I saw too late
The follies of a lover;
The hour wherein I found such loss
As care cannot recover.
And last, the minute of mishap,
Which makes me thus to plain
The doleful fruits of lover's suits,
Which labour lose in vain:
Doth make me solemnly protest,
As I with pain do prove,
There is no time, year, day, nor hour,
Nor minute, good to love."

2297,Emotion,TimePoemsTheFallenATimeToSleepATimeToWakePoembyanthonyrubino,"High above, sitting on his ledge, to himself he is to think.  I am neither nor am I heard.  I am as ghost.  I try and I try, oh how hard I do try, but I must, I mustn’t cry, but now instead his hazel eyes grow moist.  A heavy line and scarred face is stained by years.
Such a said faith for this one of light, personally known for the slayings of both the serpent and a dragon, should have never become one of the fallen.
Children need never suffer, but pain is so much a part of this child’s life.  Pain, his unwanted friend, in a sense his religion, and in death he hopes they will part.
A body that has long been broken, as he is to lay, his body he has now split open.  The blade is then tossed away as an unwanted token.  Blood flows now, as the darkest of wines from a child who did nothing but shine.
Sleep he must, ashes to ashes.  Drifting off he prays to his Gods and Angels to take him to a special time and place he once knew of long ago.  Dusk to dusk, in this sleep he must trust.
My a rose hear of his name, the fruit has fallen from the vine, for it has been said, that of which has been lost may never be saved!
Eyes closed, in his sleep, he is to speak a name, and that name is Payne.  True the shadow would, cut off the mist one has come.  The figure approaching is that of a female, a beautiful female in fact.  A sprit of an angel has arrived, the angel known as Payne, and she has come to get by her loved one’s side.  For here was a very special love between these two children.  Upon her passing from the physical to the next, from the next she had become his guardian angel.
Kneeling besides her special one, speaking softly.  No, no what have you done, not like this, not like this.  Then screaming out, calling to the Elder known as Further, Further why have you let this happen, why have you all let this happen why.  You will answer me Further, why let this happen.
Sands of time slips from hands of has one who sleeps.  Now she weeps her tears.  She sweeps away from her cheeks.
Payne, a voice from the shadows is to say.  It is not yet too late to save, Payne you can save your special one from the grave.
The love you feel for him all know, stop the blood flow, mend his wounded wings, tie with a bow, but then you must not go, this time yourself you must show, to him this time yourself you must show.
My child Payne, now you must please listen to me.  The children were never meant to suffer, but some do.  You know of this first hand as you yourself are one of the light.  The child besides you, this one of light was always meant to fight, this one, to the evil ones is to install fright, for the children of the light have always kept what is true and right.  So my angel Payne, mend his broken wings so again he may take flight.  I go now Payne.
Wait further wait she is to say, but nothing, not another word from Further is to be heard.
Payne is to hold the sleeping one gently in her delicate arms, spoken are words just so soft.
Love, it is I Payne, your wounds with a bow I did tie, please I beg of you, on me you mustn’t die.  Love of mine, you mustn’t go to the pine, instead brighter than the sun, moon and stars you may shine.
Never surrender, surrender not to the pretender.  Great bird of prey, my love falcon, your wings I did cure, together again we shall sore, falcon a fallen one you are no more.
I have a kiss for you, for my love has always been true.  Now my beauty you will take, my breath you take.  Falcon I need you to awake.  Falcon I beg of you awake, please awake!
In the shadows, elder Further is to quietly whisper to himself.  It is this one, who possess the light, this child in his darkest of hours will yield the most destructive of powers and this he does for all of ours!

2298,Emotion,TimePoemsNoTimeLikeTheOldTimePoembyOliverWendellHolmes,"THERE is no time like the old time, when you and I were young,
When the buds of April blossomed, and the birds of spring-time sung!
The garden's brightest glories by summer suns are nursed,
But oh, the sweet, sweet violets, the flowers that opened first!
There is no place like the old place, where you and I were born,
Where we lifted first our eyelids on the splendors of the morn
From the milk-white breast that warmed us, from the clinging arms that
bore,
Where the dear eyes glistened o'er us that will look on us no more!
There is no friend like the old friend, who has shared our morning days,
No greeting like his welcome, no homage like his praise
Fame is the scentless sunflower, with gaudy crown of gold;
But friendship is the breathing rose, with sweets in every fold.
There is no love like the old love, that we courted in our pride;
Though our leaves are falling, falling, and we're fading side by side,
There are blossoms all around us with the colors of our dawn,
And we live in borrowed sunshine when the day-star is withdrawn.
There are no times like the old times,--they shall never be forgot!
There is no place like the old place,--keep green the dear old spot!
There are no friends like our old friends,--may Heaven prolong their
lives
There are no loves like our old loves,--God bless our loving wives!"

Is Time long past.
A tone which is now forever fled,
A hope which is now forever past,
A love so sweet it could not last,
Was Time long past.
There were sweet dreams in the night
Of Time long past:
And, was it sadness or delight,
Each day a shadow onward cast
Which made us wish it yet might last--
That Time long past.
There is regret, almost remorse,
For Time long past.
'Tis like a child's belovèd corse
A father watches, till at last
Beauty is like remembrance, cast
From Time long past."

Were women's looks,
And folly's all they taught me.
Her smile when Beauty granted,
I hung with gaze enchanted,

Whom maids by night
Oft meet in glen that's haunted.
Like him, too, Beauty won me;
But when the spell was on me,
If once their ray
Was turn'd away,
O! winds could not outrun me.
And are those follies going?
And is my proud heart growing

For brillant eyes
Again to set it glowing?

As from birth to death we do
We work whole day and take rest
Birds search nest at evening.
Who stays on rent or leaves old
Home is searched to establish
Some feel nice in villages near
Some search town and some cities.
Shifting is associated with habit
In migration we see necessity sure
Life changes and dazzles in search
Some do not attach mind in world.
Shifting of mind from the dark
This proceeds towards pure light
To revive faith and establish
We look forward God's wisdom sure."

Time, you can't se it at all
For it passes so quickly --- while you lean on a wall.
Who knows where time goes/
No time for the dreams you have for yourself
Nor time for reading all the books the shelf.
Not enough time to go drifting along
For one has to work eight hours long.
Who knows where time goes?
No time to laugh --- and just be alone,
No time at all for friend or foe.
Time is running out --- people all say,
Who knows where time goes --- each and every day!"

Friendship counts more
Its test can be made on floor

Rest all people are full of greed
The legend is full of sayings
No one make specific drawings
It has path of its own
Its dependability is always known
No one goes near snake
As everybody knows “life is at stake”
Similarly dangerous people are kept at distance
As nobody would want to take any chance

Good and bad is balanced and equated
Only it needs to be updated

Perhaps soon, some day or night while I am singing, my voice will

That they may help thee to consume our days?
Or dost thou spare her for her cruelties,
Being merciless like thee that no man weighs?
And yet thou seest thy power she disobeys,
Cares not for thee, but lets thee waste in vain,
And prodigal of hours and years betrays
Beauty and youth t'opinion and disdain.
Yet spare her, Time, let her exempted be,
She may become more kind to thee or me."
2311,Emotion,TimePoemsILo0kAtTh3Razorblad3Fr0mTimeToTime07PoembySelenaStar,"*this poem was written about a friend,
and what she is going thru these days*
i quit cutting a while back
and im doing good
no slits on my wrists,
no blood going down my arm,
everything was fine
i had even quit using my 'rubber buddy'
but its not so easy
when your family is like mine
an alchoholic dad,
who's acts more like a kid than i do
hes always yelling
and calling me names
a stubborn sister,
who loves to blackmail me
and who acts like i get everything
when everything=all of their crap
a god worshiping mother,
who thinks im the one causing her to take meds
she blames me when mistakes happen
she even thought i was pregnant one time
but as hard as it was,
i held back the anger, the hurt, every feeling
and now i wana let it loose
the tamed lion wants out!
i promised my brother,
i wouldnt cut again
and i have to stick to my promise
no matter what!
but every now and then
i catch myself, looking at the razorblade again"
2312,Emotion,TimePoemsOnTimePoembyJohnMilton,"Fly, envious Time, till thou run out thy race,
Call on the lazy leaden-stepping hours,
Whose speed is but the heavy plummet's pace;
And glut thyself with what thy womb devours,
Which is no more than what is false and vain,
And merely mortal dross;
So little is our loss,
So little is thy gain.
For when as each thing bad thou hast intombed,
And last of all thy greedy self consumed,
Then long Eternity shall greet our bliss
With an individual kiss,
And Joy shall overtake us as a flood;
When every thing that is sincerely good
And perfectly divine,
With truth, and peace, and love, shall ever shine
About the supreme throne
Of Him, t' whose happy-making sight alone
When once our heav'nly-guided soul shall climb,
Then, all this earthly grossness quit,
Attired with stars, we shall for ever sit,
Triumphing over Death, and Chance, and thee, O Time."
2313,Emotion,TimePoemsSonnetViiHowSoonHathTimeTheSubtleThiefOfYouthPoembyJohnMilton,"How soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth,
Stoln on his wing my three and twentieth year!
My hasting days fly on wtih full career,
But my late spring no bud or blossom shew'th.
Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth,
That I to manhood am arrived so near,
And inward ripeness doth much less appear,
That some more timely-happy spirits endu'th.
Yet be it less or more, or soon or slow,
It shall be still in strictest measure even
To that same lot, however mean or high,
Toward which Time leads me, and the will of Heaven;
All is, if I have grace to use it so,
As ever in my great Taskmaster's eye."
2314,Emotion,TimePoemsMiltonAndDidThoseFeetInAncientTimePoembyWilliamBlake,"And did those feet in ancient time
Walk upon England's mountains green?
And was the holy Lamb of God
On England's pleasant pastures seen?
And did the Countenance Divine
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?
And was Jerusalem builded here
Among these dark Satanic mills?
Bring me my bow of burning gold:
Bring me my arrows of desire:
Bring me my spear: O clouds unfold!
Bring me my chariot of fire.
I will not cease from mental fight,
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand
Till we have built Jerusalem
In England's green and pleasant land."

2316,Emotion,TimePoemsSonnetXixDevouringTimeBluntThouTheLionsPawsPoembyWilliamShakespeare,"Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
And burn the long-liv'd Phoenix in her blood;
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,
And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,
To the wide world and all her fading sweets;
But I forbid thee one more heinous crime:
O, carve not with the hours my love's fair brow,
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen!
Him in thy course untainted do allow
For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
Yet do thy worst, old Time! Despite thy wrong
My love shall in my verse ever live young."
2317,Emotion,TimePoemsATimeToComeATimeToGoPoembyAdrianFlett,"Memories arrive unannounced
in the head, much inclined
to hold in thrall, let them bounce
about, and fill the mind.
Those thoughts when young,
energy filled, I watch hope to be
like them as further along
the pathway I go to my destiny.
Those times of reaching maturity,
now being singularly able,
and thinking one's immorality
to be and remain ever stable.
Watching those depart who want to stay
leaving me more and more alone.
Seeing them all here today
but tomorrow gone,
no semblance or clue of where,
old friends lost in space,
they've gone now, left us unaware,
the only clues hope and faith."
2318,Emotion,TimePoemsTimeBabyJustTimePoembyEricCockrell,"jail time, heroin time,

sleeping in old cars time,

2319,Emotion,TimePoemsToThinkOfTimePoembyWaltWhitman,"To think of time--of all that retrospection!
To think of to-day, and the ages continued henceforward!
Have you guess'd you yourself would not continue?
Have you dreaded these earth-beetles?
Have you fear'd the future would be nothing to you?
Is to-day nothing? Is the beginningless past nothing?
If the future is nothing, they are just as surely nothing.
To think that the sun rose in the east! that men and women were
flexible, real, alive! that everything was alive!
To think that you and I did not see, feel, think, nor bear our part!
To think that we are now here, and bear our part!                  10
Not a day passes--not a minute or second, without an accouchement!
Not a day passes--not a minute or second, without a corpse!
The dull nights go over, and the dull days also,
The soreness of lying so much in bed goes over,
The physician, after long putting off, gives the silent and terrible
look for an answer,
The children come hurried and weeping, and the brothers and sisters
are sent for,
Medicines stand unused on the shelf--(the camphor-smell has long
pervaded the rooms,)
The faithful hand of the living does not desert the hand of the
dying,
The twitching lips press lightly on the forehead of the dying,
The breath ceases, and the pulse of the heart ceases,              20
The corpse stretches on the bed, and the living look upon it,
It is palpable as the living are palpable.
The living look upon the corpse with their eye-sight,
But without eye-sight lingers a different living, and looks curiously
on the corpse.
To think the thought of Death, merged in the thought of materials!
To think that the rivers will flow, and the snow fall, and fruits
ripen, and act upon others as upon us now--yet not act upon us!
To think of all these wonders of city and country, and others taking
great interest in them--and we taking no interest in them!
To think how eager we are in building our houses!
To think others shall be just as eager, and we quite indifferent!
(I see one building the house that serves him a few years, or seventy
or eighty years at most,                                     30
I see one building the house that serves him longer than that.)
Slow-moving and black lines creep over the whole earth--they never
cease--they are the burial lines,
He that was President was buried, and he that is now President shall
surely be buried.
A reminiscence of the vulgar fate,
A frequent sample of the life and death of workmen,
Each after his kind:
Cold dash of waves at the ferry-wharf--posh and ice in the river,
half-frozen mud in the streets, a gray, discouraged sky
overhead, the short, last daylight of Twelfth-month,
A hearse and stages--other vehicles give place--the funeral of an old
Broadway stage-driver, the cortege mostly drivers.
Steady the trot to the cemetery, duly rattles the death-bell, the
gate is pass'd, the new-dug grave is halted at, the living
alight, the hearse uncloses,
The coffin is pass'd out, lower'd and settled, the whip is laid on
the coffin, the earth is swiftly shovel'd in,                40
The mound above is flatted with the spades--silence,
A minute--no one moves or speaks--it is done,
He is decently put away--is there anything more?
He was a good fellow, free-mouth'd, quick-temper'd, not bad-looking,
able to take his own part, witty, sensitive to a slight, ready
with life or death for a friend, fond of women, gambled, ate
hearty, drank hearty, had known what it was to be flush, grew
low-spirited toward the last, sicken'd, was help'd by a
contribution, died, aged forty-one years--and that was his
funeral.
Thumb extended, finger uplifted, apron, cape, gloves, strap, wet-
weather clothes, whip carefully chosen, boss, spotter, starter,
hostler, somebody loafing on you, you loafing on somebody,
headway, man before and man behind, good day's work, bad day's
work, pet stock, mean stock, first out, last out, turning-in at
night;
To think that these are so much and so nigh to other drivers--and he
there takes no interest in them!
The markets, the government, the working-man's wages--to think what
account they are through our nights and days!
To think that other working-men will make just as great account of
them--yet we make little or no account!
The vulgar and the refined--what you call sin, and what you call
goodness--to think how wide a difference!
To think the difference will still continue to others, yet we lie
beyond the difference.                                       50
To think how much pleasure there is!
Have you pleasure from looking at the sky? have you pleasure from
poems?
Do you enjoy yourself in the city? or engaged in business? or
planning a nomination and election? or with your wife and
family?
Or with your mother and sisters? or in womanly housework? or the
beautiful maternal cares?
--These also flow onward to others--you and I flow onward,
But in due time, you and I shall take less interest in them.
Your farm, profits, crops,--to think how engross'd you are!
To think there will still be farms, profits, crops--yet for you, of
what avail?
What will be, will be well--for what is, is well,
To take interest is well, and not to take interest shall be well.  60
The sky continues beautiful,
The pleasure of men with women shall never be sated, nor the pleasure
of women with men, nor the pleasure from poems,
The domestic joys, the daily housework or business, the building of
houses--these are not phantasms--they have weight, form,
location;
Farms, profits, crops, markets, wages, government, are none of them
phantasms,
The difference between sin and goodness is no delusion,
The earth is not an echo--man and his life, and all the things of his
life, are well-consider'd.
You are not thrown to the winds--you gather certainly and safely
around yourself;
Yourself! Yourself! Yourself, forever and ever!
It is not to diffuse you that you were born of your mother and
father--it is to identify you;
It is not that you should be undecided, but that you should be
decided;                                                     70
Something long preparing and formless is arrived and form'd in you,
You are henceforth secure, whatever comes or goes.
The threads that were spun are gather'd, the weft crosses the warp,
the pattern is systematic.
The preparations have every one been justified,
The orchestra have sufficiently tuned their instruments--the baton
has given the signal.
The guest that was coming--he waited long, for reasons--he is now
housed,
He is one of those who are beautiful and happy--he is one of those
that to look upon and be with is enough.
The law of the past cannot be eluded,
The law of the present and future cannot be eluded,
The law of the living cannot be eluded--it is eternal,             80
The law of promotion and transformation cannot be eluded,
The law of heroes and good-doers cannot be eluded,
The law of drunkards, informers, mean persons--not one iota thereof
can be eluded.
Slow moving and black lines go ceaselessly over the earth,
Northerner goes carried, and Southerner goes carried, and they on the
Atlantic side, and they on the Pacific, and they between, and
all through the Mississippi country, and all over the earth.
The great masters and kosmos are well as they go--the heroes and
good-doers are well,
The known leaders and inventors, and the rich owners and pious and
distinguish'd, may be well,
But there is more account than that--there is strict account of all.
The interminable hordes of the ignorant and wicked are not nothing,
The barbarians of Africa and Asia are not nothing,                 90
The common people of Europe are not nothing--the American aborigines
are not nothing,
The infected in the immigrant hospital are not nothing--the murderer
or mean person is not nothing,
The perpetual successions of shallow people are not nothing as they
go,
The lowest prostitute is not nothing--the mocker of religion is not
nothing as he goes.
Of and in all these things,
I have dream'd that we are not to be changed so much, nor the law of
us changed,
I have dream'd that heroes and good-doers shall be under the present
and past law,
And that murderers, drunkards, liars, shall be under the present and
past law,
For I have dream'd that the law they are under now is enough.
If otherwise, all came but to ashes of dung,                      100
If maggots and rats ended us, then Alarum! for we are betray'd!
Then indeed suspicion of death.
Do you suspect death? If I were to suspect death, I should die now,
Do you think I could walk pleasantly and well-suited toward
annihilation?
Pleasantly and well-suited I walk,
Whither I walk I cannot define, but I know it is good,
The whole universe indicates that it is good,
The past and the present indicate that it is good.
How beautiful and perfect are the animals!
How perfect the earth, and the minutest thing upon it!            110
What is called good is perfect, and what is called bad is just as
perfect,
The vegetables and minerals are all perfect, and the imponderable
fluids are perfect;
Slowly and surely they have pass'd on to this, and slowly and surely
they yet pass on.
I swear I think now that everything without exception has an eternal Soul!
The trees have, rooted in the ground! the weeds of the sea have! the
animals!
I swear I think there is nothing but immortality!
That the exquisite scheme is for it, and the nebulous float is for
it, and the cohering is for it;
And all preparation is for it! and identity is for it! and life and
materials are altogether for it!"
2320,Emotion,TimePoemsThePloughOfTimePoembyLawrenceFerlinghetti,"Night closed my windows and
The sky became a crystal house
The crystal windows glowed
The moon
shown through them
through the whole house of crystal
A single star beamed down
its crystal cable
and drew a plough through the earth
unearthing bodies clasped together
couples embracing
around the earth
They clung together everywhere
emitting small cries
that did not reach the stars
The crystal earth turned
and the bodies with it
And the sky did not turn
nor the stars with it
The stars remained fixed
each with its crystal cable
beamed to earth
each attached to the immense plough
furrowing our lives"
2321,Emotion,TimePoemsToTheVirginsMakeMuchOfTimePoembyRobertHerrick,"Gather ye rose-buds while ye may:
Old Time is still a-flying;
And this same flower that smiles to-day,
To-morrow will be dying.
The glorious lamp of heaven, the Sun,
The higher he's a-getting,
The sooner will his race be run,
And nearer he's to setting.
That age is best, which is the first,
When youth and blood are warmer;
But being spent, the worse, and worst
Times, still succeed the former.
- Then be not coy, but use your time,
And while ye may, go marry;
For having lost but once your prime,
You may for ever tarry."

So what will become of the 4th dimension?
The Saudis have their intention to make time based on Mecca time that is certain.
True, the mathematics that we use in the west was from numbers that were taken from the Middle-East,
And the dominance of  'time' is more than a physicist's dream feast,
The battle is underway,
For centuries, an astronomy observatory in Greenwich, London - the namesake of Greenwich Mean Time - has been the reference point for lines of longitude, ships' navigation on the world's seas and the time zones used today.
Move over Big Ben, a clock atop a tall, tall, tall building located in Mecca will be beginning to chime.
But Saudi Arabia wants to change that. It's building what it calls the largest clock in the world, atop the second-largest skyscraper in the world, in the Islamic holy city of Mecca - in hopes of replacing GMT with 'Mecca Time.'
The Saudis intend to have Greenwich Mean Time changed to Mecca Mean Time.
So what will become of the atomic cesium clock?
What will become of the different time zones?
What day does daytime begin?
Does anybody care?
Einstein's Theory of Relativity comes into play here,
From my perspective.
Time is on no one side,
Time is from the time we are born to the time we die,
For those who believe infinity, infinity has no time,
No seconds, minutes, hours, day, weeks, months or years, decades, or millennium,
And may I spend eternity with my soul mate, my wife, Judy.

The flowers of spring
And all those pleasures
That summer will bring
But as the winds will change
And the summer will set
Nature paints a picture

Treasure the autumn

The crisp fall air
On those moon lit eves
It's a blessing at best
Not costing a dime
For all to enjoy
Yes --- it's autumn time.."
2324,Emotion,TimePoemsisTimeAWasteOrIsLifeAWasteOfTimePoembyAngelicWarrior,"Some say life is beautiful
some say its sad.
Some people see forests of green
some see stumps.
Doves fly peacefully in the sky.
Only to be chased away by vultures.
Some say that technology moves forward
Some say we're loosing knowledge.
Some people see gardens of daisies
Some see dead grass.
Does each generation move forward?
Or are we someday going to find ourselves back at the begining?
Some hope for world peace
Some hope with greed.
Some are destined to greatness
Some are never given a chance.
Suicide is more and more popular.
When did death become the only solution?
Some hope for a second chance
Some hope for the end.
Some are born able to fly
Some don't even have wings.
Is time a waste or is Life a waste of time?
If suddenly time were to 'stop'
No clocks or indications of passing
Would people go on with their lives?
Would we go into chaos?

To get from point A to point B
Marked by time
What if we didn't need a reason?
If we could just BE! ?"

of yesteryears life,
Days come and go,

Hours slip through thoughts,
As sand slips through fingers.
I wish the world would slow.
Time to think and plan for tommorow.
As eyes succumb to the weight of the night,
Morning emerges with it's sharp light.
Days drift into new days,
each one a stage of plays.
There is no time to look and to love,
Faces flash by with eyes to the ground,

Time time the hour is still
With dreams to pass by
And every ones fulfill
Until they fade and fly
Oh rush not these senses
That makes us their joy
When hours flow and dances
As time they destroy
Time you always are new
Though old you sometime seems
When you are going though

Forget behind and dance the jive
It will be fine...
Go build a kite and make it fly
Just live the life by rest and lie
Relax the mind, exact the mine
Work on the five, solve it to nine
Grow a pine, love it so kind

He held out then
A writing, as he went,
And ask'd me, when
False man would be content
To pay again
What God and Nature lent.

In which were sands but few,
As he did pass,
He shew'd,--and told me too
Mine end near was;--
And so away he flew."

Weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep,
And each imagined pinnacle and steep
Of godlike hardship tells me I must die
Like a sick eagle looking at the sky.
Yet 'tis a gentle luxury to weep,
That I have not the cloudy winds to keep
Fresh for the opening of the morning's eye.
Such dim-conceived glories of the brain
Bring round the heart an indescribable feud;
So do these wonders a most dizzy pain,
That mingles Grecian grandeur with the rude
Wasting of old Time -with a billowy main,
A sun, a shadow of a magnitude."

I have been given so much

Where the weary are at rest,
In that blissful port called Heaven,
Where are roaming now the blest.

Be gentle, time be gentle with us,
While we are on life's troubled stream,
May life's foaming billows o'er us
Break away as day serene.
Gently on the stream of time,
We will swiftly glide along,
Till we reach the realm divine,
Then we'll join the heavenly throng,
Where our friends have gone before us
Waiting on the other shore.
In that home they sing in chorus,
""Welcome home the rich and poor.""
Gently on the stream of time,
We shall shortly pass away,
We shall reach the heavenly clime
If God's commands we obey.
Gently on the stream of time
We are going one by one,
Listening to the evening chime
On life's journey going home."

and when I started praying,
I found myself in a different moment.
Alas! I could not follow His orders well in time.
How can I get what I prayed for?
Tears came in my eyes!
How helpless is the man!
But my great teacher wiped my tears.
Congratulated me,
and asked me to smile,
as He gave me that
what I prayed for,
immediately when I intended to pray for it.
My intentions were well in time.
Man is not so much helpless!"
2339,Emotion,TimePoemsWarbleOfLilacTimePoembyWaltWhitman,"WARBLE me now, for joy of Lilac-time,
Sort me, O tongue and lips, for Nature's sake, and sweet life's
sake--and death's the same as life's,
Souvenirs of earliest summer--birds' eggs, and the first berries;
Gather the welcome signs, (as children, with pebbles, or stringing
shells;)
Put in April and May--the hylas croaking in the ponds--the elastic
air,
Bees, butterflies, the sparrow with its simple notes,
Blue-bird, and darting swallow--nor forget the high-hole flashing his
golden wings,
The tranquil sunny haze, the clinging smoke, the vapor,
Spiritual, airy insects, humming on gossamer wings,
Shimmer of waters, with fish in them--the cerulean above;          10
All that is jocund and sparkling--the brooks running,
The maple woods, the crisp February days, and the sugar-making;
The robin, where he hops, bright-eyed, brown-breasted,
With musical clear call at sunrise, and again at sunset,
Or flitting among the trees of the apple-orchard, building the nest
of his mate;
The melted snow of March--the willow sending forth its yellow-green
sprouts;
--For spring-time is here! the summer is here! and what is this in it
and from it?
Thou, Soul, unloosen'd--the restlessness after I know not what;
Come! let us lag here no longer--let us be up and away!
O for another world! O if one could but fly like a bird!           20
O to escape--to sail forth, as in a ship!
To glide with thee, O Soul, o'er all, in all, as a ship o'er the
waters!
--Gathering these hints, these preludes--the blue sky, the grass, the
morning drops of dew;
(With additional songs--every spring will I now strike up additional
songs,
Nor ever again forget, these tender days, the chants of Death as well
as Life;)
The lilac-scent, the bushes, and the dark green, heart-shaped leaves,
Wood violets, the little delicate pale blossoms called innocence,
Samples and sorts not for themselves alone, but for their atmosphere,
To tally, drench'd with them, tested by them,
Cities and artificial life, and all their sights and scenes,       30
My mind henceforth, and all its meditations--my recitatives,
My land, my age, my race, for once to serve in songs,
(Sprouts, tokens ever of death indeed the same as life,)
To grace the bush I love--to sing with the birds,
A warble for joy of Lilac-time."
2340,Emotion,TimePoemsTheSpringtimeOTheSpringTimePoembyAlfredAustin,"The Spring-time, O the Spring-time!
Who does not know it well?
When the little birds begin to build,
And the buds begin to swell.
When the sun with the clouds plays hide-and-seek,
And the lambs are bucking and bleating,
And the colour mounts to the maiden's cheek,
And the cuckoo scatters greeting;
In the Spring-time, joyous Spring-time!
The Summer, O the Summer!
Who does not know it well?
When the ringdoves coo the long day through,
And the bee refills his cell.
When the swish of the mower is heard at morn,
And we all in the woods go roaming,
And waiting is over, and love is born,
And shy lips meet in the gloaming;
In the Summer, ripening Summer!
The Autumn, O the Autumn!
Who does not know it well?
When the leaf turns brown, and the mast drops down,
And the chestnut splits its shell.
When we muse o'er the days that have gone before,
And the days that will follow after,
When the grain lies deep on the winnowing-floor,
And the plump gourd hangs from the rafter;
In the Autumn, thoughtful Autumn!
The Winter, O the Winter!
Who does not know it well?
When, day after day, the fields stretch gray,
And the peewit wails on the fell.
When we close up the crannies and shut out the cold,
And the wind sounds hoarse and hollow,
And our dead loves sleep in the churchyard mould,
And we feel that we soon shall follow;
In the Winter, mournful Winter!"

Here on Earth or out in space
The doors are open if you choose
To learn the skills that you can use

We're on our way to the stars at long last

Learn these things, and many more
See what wonders the world has in store
Don't let folly lead you away
From Learning the skills you need so today
Have fun in your life, but don't learn with sorrow
That the fun of today won't feed you tomorrow
Be good to yourself, and study with zest,

2343,Emotion,TimePoemsTwoTrampsInMudTimePoembyRobertFrost,"Out of the mud two strangers came
And caught me splitting wood in the yard,
And one of them put me off my aim
By hailing cheerily ""Hit them hard!""
I knew pretty well why he had dropped behind
And let the other go on a way.
I knew pretty well what he had in mind:
He wanted to take my job for pay.
Good blocks of oak it was I split,
As large around as the chopping block;
And every piece I squarely hit
Fell splinterless as a cloven rock.
The blows that a life of self-control
Spares to strike for the common good,
That day, giving a loose my soul,
I spent on the unimportant wood.
The sun was warm but the wind was chill.
You know how it is with an April day
When the sun is out and the wind is still,
You're one month on in the middle of May.
But if you so much as dare to speak,
A cloud comes over the sunlit arch,
A wind comes off a frozen peak,
And you're two months back in the middle of March.
A bluebird comes tenderly up to alight
And turns to the wind to unruffle a plume,
His song so pitched as not to excite
A single flower as yet to bloom.
It is snowing a flake; and he half knew
Winter was only playing possum.
Except in color he isn't blue,
But he wouldn't advise a thing to blossom.
The water for which we may have to look
In summertime with a witching wand,
In every wheelrut's now a brook,
In every print of a hoof a pond.
Be glad of water, but don't forget
The lurking frost in the earth beneath
That will steal forth after the sun is set
And show on the water its crystal teeth.
The time when most I loved my task
The two must make me love it more
By coming with what they came to ask.
You'd think I never had felt before
The weight of an ax-head poised aloft,
The grip of earth on outspread feet,
The life of muscles rocking soft
And smooth and moist in vernal heat.
Out of the wood two hulking tramps
(From sleeping God knows where last night,
But not long since in the lumber camps).
They thought all chopping was theirs of right.
Men of the woods and lumberjacks,
They judged me by their appropriate tool.
Except as a fellow handled an ax
They had no way of knowing a fool.
Nothing on either side was said.
They knew they had but to stay their stay
And all their logic would fill my head:
As that I had no right to play
With what was another man's work for gain.
My right might be love but theirs was need.
And where the two exist in twain
Theirs was the better right--agreed.
But yield who will to their separation,
My object in living is to unite
My avocation and my vocation
As my two eyes make one in sight.
Only where love and need are one,
And the work is play for mortal stakes,
Is the deed ever really done
For Heaven and the future's sakes."
2344,Emotion,TimePoemsTWasJustThisTimeLastYearIDiedPoembyEmilyDickinson,"'T was just this time last year I died.
I know I heard the corn,
When I was carried by the farms,--
It had the tassels on.
I thought how yellow it would look
When Richard went to mill;
And then I wanted to get out,
But something held my will.
I thought just how red apples wedged
The stubble's joints between;
And carts went stooping round the fields
To take the pumpkins in.
I wondered which would miss me least,
And when Thanksgiving came,
If father'd multiply the plates
To make an even sum.
And if my stocking hung too high,
Would it blur the Christmas glee,
That not a Santa Claus could reach
The altitude of me?
But this sort grieved myself, and so
I thought how it would be
When just this time, some perfect year,
Themselves should come to me."

Brazen-thunder-hurler,
Cloud-whirler, son-of-Kronos,
Send vengeance on these Oreads
Who strew
White frozen flecks of mist and cloud
Over the brown trees and the tufted grass
Of the meadows, where the stream
Runs black through shining banks
Of bluish white.
Zeus,
Are the halls of heaven broken up
That you flake down upon me
Feather-strips of marble?
Dis and Styx!
When I stamp my hoof
The frozen-cloud-specks jam into the cleft
So that I reel upon two slippery points ...
Fool, to stand here cursing
When I might be running!"

2347,Emotion,TimePoemsInADarkTimePoembyTheodoreRoethke,"In a dark time, the eye begins to see,
I meet my shadow in the deepening shade;
I hear my echo in the echoing wood--
A lord of nature weeping to a tree.
I live between the heron and the wren,
Beasts of the hill and serpents of the den.
What's madness but nobility of soul
At odds with circumstance? The day's on fire!
I know the purity of pure despair,
My shadow pinned against a sweating wall.
That place among the rocks--is it a cave,
Or a winding path? The edge is what I have.
A steady storm of correspondences!
A night flowing with birds, a ragged moon,
And in broad day the midnight come again!
A man goes far to find out what he is--
Death of the self in a long, tearless night,
All natural shapes blazing unnatural light.
Dark, dark my light, and darker my desire.
My soul, like some heat-maddened summer fly,
Keeps buzzing at the sill. Which I is I?
A fallen man, I climb out of my fear.
The mind enters itself, and God the mind,
And one is One, free in the tearing wind."

The towering Babels that we raised
Where scoffing sophists brawl,
The little Antichrists we praised --
The night is on them all.
The fool hath said . . . The fool hath said . ..
And we, who deemed him wise,
We who believed that Thou wast dead,
How should we seek Thine eyes?
How should we seek to Thee for power
Who scorned Thee yesterday?
How should we kneel, in this dread hour?
Lord, teach us how to pray!
Grant us the single heart, once more,
That mocks no sacred thing,
The Sword of Truth our fathers wore
When Thou wast Lord and King.

For, while our souls in darkness dwell,
We know that Thou art there."

So these furrows in this body I behold, as

Still, I remember things way back yonder:
Sculptured summer grass,
Children ringing around roses
With Pockets filled with poses,
Barren tree leaves
Floating in the breeze...woman!

For the past archives still.
I’ll never be older than the goddess of art.

Let the earlier years delight in the older ones

To love me, I looked forward to the moon
To slacken all those bonds which seemed too soon
And quickly tied to make a lasting troth.
Quick-loving hearts, I thought, may quickly loathe;
And, looking on myself, I seemed not one
For such man's love!--more like an out-of-tune
Worn viol, a good singer would be wroth
To spoil his song with, and which, snatched in haste,
Is laid down at the first ill-sounding note.
I did not wrong myself so, but I placed
A wrong on thee. For perfect strains may float
'Neath master-hands, from instruments defaced,--
And great souls, at one stroke, may do and doat."

And the loved one all together!
This path--how soft to pace!
This May -- what magic weather!
Where is the loved one's face?
In a dream that loved one's face meets mine,
But the house is narrow, the place is bleak
Where, outside, rain and wind combine
With a furtive ear, if I strive to speak,
With a hostile eye at my flushing cheek,
With a malice that marks each word, each sign!
O enemy sly and serpentine,
Uncoil thee from the waking man!
Do I hold the Past
Thus firm and fast
Yet doubt if the Future hold I can?
This path so soft to pace shall lead
Thro' the magic of May to herself indeed!
Or narrow if needs the house must be,
Outside are the storms and strangers: we
Oh, close, safe, warm sleep I and she, --

And since we lads are proud and true,
What else remains to do?
Lucasta, when to France your man
Returns his fourth time, hating war,
Yet laughs as calmly as he can
And flings an oath, but says no more,
That is not courage, that’s not fear—
Lucasta he’s a Fusilier,
And his pride sends him here.
Let statesmen bluster, bark and bray,
And so decide who started
This bloody war, and who’s to pay,
But he must be stout-hearted,
Must sit and stake with quiet breath,
Playing at cards with Death.
Don’t plume yourself he fights for you;
It is no courage, love, or hate,
But let us do the things we do;
It’s pride that makes the heart be great;
It is not anger, no, nor fear—
Lucasta he’s a Fusilier,
And his pride keeps him here."

The first, and sought the forehead, and half missed,
Half falling on the hair. O beyond meed!

The Druid, grey, wood-nurtured, quiet-eyed,
Who cast round Fergus dreams, and ruin untold;
And thine own sadness, where of stars, grown old
In dancing silver-sandalled on the sea,
Sing in their high and lonely melody.
Come near, that no more blinded hy man's fate,
I find under the boughs of love and hate,
In all poor foolish things that live a day,
Eternal beauty wandering on her way.
Come near, come near, come near -- Ah, leave me still
A little space for the rose-breath to fill!
Lest I no more bear common things that crave;
The weak worm hiding down in its small cave,
The field-mouse running by me in the grass,
And heavy mortal hopes that toil and pass;
But seek alone to hear the strange things said
By God to the bright hearts of those long dead,
And learn to chaunt a tongue men do not know.
Come near; I would, before my time to go,
Sing of old Eire and the ancient ways:
Red Rose, proud Rose, sad Rose of all my days."

Madam? And their children. Then I turn back on my steps, my steps turn back too, but I don't
know exactly what they turn back on. I consult a schedule; the names of the towns have been
replaced by the names of people who have been quite close to me. Shall I go to A, return to B,
change at X? Yes, of course I'll change at X. Provided I don't miss the connection with boredom!
There we are: boredom, beautiful parallels, ah! how beautiful the parallels are under God's
perpendicular."
2377,Emotion,TimePoemsTimeEndlessTimePoembyDavidWood,"The seasons always come around;
For time cannot be interrupted
A frigid winter cold and frosty
Gives way to a fleeting spring
Where new life is found.
Time is a never ending race,
The hours, days and weeks pass,
Sometimes unnoticed in our busy lives
Then the long eternity comes with a kiss
When our time gives up its final pace.
Time is something  we have to give
To those whom we love, it can't be rushed
It is a soothing balm to heal and calm
When all of life becomes too much
And tender hearts again learn to live.
Time is like the vast vacuum of space,
It is endless. Time is forgiving if not rushed
And we have to catch those special
Moments in time as it cannot be reversed
And guard them with such sweet grace."
2378,Emotion,TimePoemsOpenTimePoembyLouiseImogenGuiney,"Open, Time, and let him pass
Shortly where his feet would be!
Like a leaf at Michaelmas
Swooning from the tree,
Ere its hour the manly mind
Trembles in a sure decrease,
Nor the body now can find
Any hold on peace.
Take him, weak and overworn;
Fold about his dying dream
Boyhood, and the April morn,
And the rolling stream:
Weather on a sunny ridge,
Showery weather, far from here;
Under some deep-ivied bridge,
Water rushing clear:
Water quick to cross and part,
(Golden light on silver sound),
Weather that was next his heart
All the world around!
Soon upon his vision break
These, in their remembered blue;
He shall toil no more, but wake
Young, in air he knew.
He has done with roofs and men.
Open, Time, and let him pass,
Vague and innocent again,
Into country grass."
2379,Emotion,TimePoemsOhForTheSwordsOfFormerTimePoembyThomasMoore,"Oh for the swords of former time!
Oh for the men who bore them,
When, arm'd for Right, they stood sublime,
And tyrants crouch'd before them:
When free yet, ere courts began
With honours to enslave him,
The best honours worn by Man
Were those which Virtue gave him.
Oh for the swords, etc., etc.
Oh for the Kings who flourish'd then!
Oh for the pomp that crown'd them,
When hearts and hands of freeborn men
Were all the ramparts round them.
When, safe built on bosoms true,
The throne was but the centre,
Round which Love a circle drew
That Treason durst not enter.
Oh, for the Kings who flourish'd then!
Oh for the pomp that crown'd them,
When hearts and hands of freeborn men
Were all the ramparts round them!"
2380,Emotion,TimePoemsTheCourseOfLifeTimeAndEventsAndTheProcessOfChangePoembyMerlinArchivilla,"Time or fate may separate friends, lovers,
But friendship or love that's true will ever
Thenceforth continue to live forever,
True love conquers the odd with its power.
As time passes by, things change with the time,
Every moment, hour, day, month, and year,
All things have their turn to change with the time,
Life, time, and events change with the years.
Everyone, everything, have a time and day,
A time to change, end, begin a new day,
Change is life, the course of life everyday,
All things change, and we change with them all days.
Only the Eternal one is constant,
All things in the universe, inconstant,
But despite it all, love is important,
The world may change, but true love is constant."
2381,Emotion,TimePoemsTimeAgainstTimePoembyPrabirGayen,"Time against Time
My life is somewhere lost
in the seed of time,
The womb of past,
In the womb of certain summer,
In the call of a certain Cuckoo,
It was summer and I was alone,
With my dreamy eyes I was lost,
The pain was just the baby,
I was alone and outside,
My future was like waves,
And I lost all my dreams,
Without dream past remains the past,
Adamant and never to leave me,
The petals without blossoming mangled,
The flower remains unmanifest,
Without blossoming I am with pain,
Maturing day by day with no root,
My pain is my failure, my death,
I died years ago without hope,
The hope of becoming was nipped,
Without the hope of living I live,
I live where no sign of life is left,
Only vague memory of life,
Nor life as such but the dream.
The song is there in nature,
The Cuckoo is still singing,
The Green Field is still harvesting,
The peace of the land is still singing,
The Joy of life is still flowing,
The projected dream about to bloom,
Is still a projection, the screen of my mind,
My being without hope is hoping
against my life,
The childhood is a fresh delight,
The dream of childhood is lost in hopes,
A bundle of sorrow is under the self,
Attaining not the feast of life with time,
Time is gone with the warmth of mind,
In the near past all is destroyed,
Decayed with the pain maturing day by day,
Only pain of not touching life,
It was very close to dive in,
Life is a vain waiting and hoping naught,
All hope is just dust of time,
Burnt with ceasing fire.
The road to life is blocked,
Only moving with faint delight,
Where there is no way to smile,
With the Sun rise I rise and with
setting I set,
With the night I remain awake,
Still still the spirit is missing,
The joy of living is no more joy,
Only wasting time with wrong time,
As an outsider I witness everything,
To be nothing is only rays of hope,
The indifference of the vast Sky,
The stars and the dark night are
My indifferent being, my fruitless self,
Thought upon thought and no Joy,
Past is the only time heavy on soul,
The seed unborn is hovering with the
songs of birds,
The pine for not responding to time,
The pain of not touching the spirit,
Only vague memory to die with Mind.

2382,Emotion,TimePoemsWinterTimePoembyRobertLouisStevenson,"Late lies the wintry sun a-bed,
A frosty, fiery sleepy-head;
Blinks but an hour or two; and then,
A blood-red orange, sets again.
Before the stars have left the skies,
At morning in the dark I rise;
And shivering in my nakedness,
By the cold candle, bathe and dress.
Close by the jolly fire I sit
To warm my frozen bones a bit;
Or with a reindeer-sled, explore
The colder countries round the door.
When to go out, my nurse doth wrap
Me in my comforter and cap;
The cold wind burns my face, and blows
Its frosty pepper up my nose.
Black are my steps on silver sod;
Thick blows my frosty breath abroad;
And tree and house, and hill and lake,
Are frosted like a wedding cake."
2383,Emotion,TimePoemsSchoolTimePoembyKimFerguson,"Some of your classes might be boring,
But don’t you dare get caught snoring.
Get your homework done,
Then go out and have some fun.
Go out and party all night long,
But don’t forget your report on ping-pong.
There is only one solution to it all,
Get your homework done in study hall.
So when it’s time for school
Be cool.
Don’t be a fool."
2384,Emotion,TimePoemsAlwaysForTheFirstTimePoembyAndreBreton,"Always for the first time
Hardly do I know you by sight
You return at some hour of the night to a house at an angle to my window
A wholly imaginary house
It is there that from one second to the next
In the inviolate darkness
I anticipate once more the fascinating rift occurring
The one and only rift
In the facade and in my heart
The closer I come to you
In reality
The more the key sings at the door of the unknown room
Where you appear alone before me
At first you coalesce entirely with the brightness
The elusive angle of a curtain
It's a field of jasmine I gazed upon at dawn on a road in the vicinity of Grasse
With the diagonal slant of its girls picking
Behind them the dark falling wing of the plants stripped bare
Before them a T-square of dazzling light
The curtain invisibly raised
In a frenzy all the flowers swarm back in
It is you at grips with that too long hour never dim enough until sleep
You as though you could be
The same except that I shall perhaps never meet you
You pretend not to know I am watching you
Marvelously I am no longer sure you know
You idleness brings tears to my eyes
A swarm of interpretations surrounds each of your gestures
It's a honeydew hunt
There are rocking chairs on a deck there are branches that may well scratch you in the forest
There are in a shop window in the rue Notre-Dame-de-Lorette
Two lovely crossed legs caught in long stockings
Flaring out in the center of a great white clover
There is a silken ladder rolled out over the ivy
There is
By my leaning over the precipice
Of your presence and your absence in hopeless fusion
My finding the secret
Of loving you
Always for the first time"

2387,Emotion,TimePoemsFindTimePoembyWilliamJWalls,"Find time, for this day shall soon be night
Find time to love, whilst you still have life
Find time to visit the sick and the old
Find time to embrace someone when they are cold.
Find time to love your family, and help a friend
Find time to invite a hungry person in
Find time to take a senior person for a walk
Find time for that someone that's lonely just to talk.
And when you've found time for these things
Rejoice and be happy for the satisfaction it brings."
2388,Emotion,TimePoemsSpringInWarTimePoembySaraTeasdale,"I feel the Spring far off, far off,
The faint far scent of bud and leaf--
Oh how can Spring take heart to come
To a world in grief,
Deep grief?
The sun turns north, the days grow long,
Later the evening star grows bright--
How can the daylight linger on
For men to fight,
Still fight?
The grass is waking in the ground,
Soon it will rise and blow in waves--
How can it have the heart to sway
Over the graves,
New graves?
Under the boughs where lovers walked
The apple-blooms will shed their breath--
But what of all the lovers now
Parted by death,
Gray Death?"

2390,Emotion,TimePoemsChristmasTimePoembySarahRodenburg,"Crowds of people shopping, here and there
A white blanket of snow everywhere
Pretty lights all aglow
Red, white, yellow, blue, and green
Signs of Christmas soon will be near
Tiny tots eyes will shine on Christmas morn
Jolly old St. Nick will arrive, in all the homes
Presents big ones, long ones, fat ones, and small ones
We're happy with them all, it's Christmas
But, what's the real meaning of Christmas?
It's not just presents we give or get
That night in the sky, a star shone over Bethlehem
Christ was born on Christmas Day.
In a manger because there was no room in the Inn that night
The three wise men brought gifts of Gold, Frankincense and myrrh.
So, Christ is Christmas time celebrated."
2391,Emotion,RedPoemsALadyRedMdashAmidTheHillPoembyEmilyDickinson,"74
A Lady red—amid the Hill
Her annual secret keeps!
A Lady white, within the Field
In placid Lily sleeps!
The tidy Breezes, with their Brooms—
Sweep vale—and hill—and tree!
Prithee, My pretty Housewives!
Who may expected be?
The Neighbors do not yet suspect!
The Woods exchange a smile!
Orchard, and Buttercup, and Bird—
In such a little while!
And yet, how still the Landscape stands!
How nonchalant the Hedge!
As if the ""Resurrection""
Were nothing very strange!"
2392,Emotion,RedPoemsAsRedMenDiePoembyEmilyPaulineJohnson,"Captive! Is there a hell to him like this?
A taunt more galling than the Huron's hiss?
He--proud and scornful, he--who laughed at law,
He--scion of the deadly Iroquois,
He--the bloodthirsty, he--the Mohawk chief,
He--who despises pain and sneers at grief,
Here in the hated Huron's vicious clutch,
That even captive he disdains to touch!
Captive! Butnever conquered; Mohawk brave
Stoops not to be to anyman a slave;
Least, to the puny tribe his soul abhors,
The tribe whose wigwams sprinkle Simcoe's shores.
With scowling brow he stands and courage high,
Watching with haughty and defiant eye
His captors, as they council o'er his fate,
Or strive his boldness to intimidate.
Then fling they unto him the choice;
""Wilt thou walk o'er the bed of fire that waits thee now--
Walk with uncovered feet upon the coals,
Until thou reach the ghostly Land of Souls,
And, with thy Mohawk death-song please our ear?
Or wilt thou with the women rest thee here?""
His eyes flash like an eagle's, and his hands
Clench at the insult. Like a god he stands.
""Prepare the fire!"" he scornfully demands.
He knoweth not that this same jeering band
Will bite the dust--will lick the Mohawk's hand;
Will kneel and cower at the Mohawk's feet;
Will shrink when Mohawk war drums wildly beat.
HIs death will be avenged with hideous hate
By Iroquois, swift to annihilate
His vile detested captors, that now flaunt
Their war clubs in his face with sneer and taunt,
Not thinking, soon that reeeking, red, and raw,
Their scalps will deck the belts of Iroquois.
The path of coals outstretches, white with heat,
A forest fir's length--ready for his feet.
Unflinching as a rock he steps along
The burning mass, and sings his wild war song;
Sings, as he sang when once he used to roam
Throughout the forests of his southern home,
Where, down the Genesee, the water roars,
Where gentle Mohawk purls between its shores,
Songs, that of exploit and of prowess tell;
Songs of the Iroquois invincible.
Up the long trail of fire he boasting goes,
Dancing a war dance to defy his foes.
His flesh is scorched, his muscles burn and shrink.
But still he dances to death's awful brink.
The eagle plume that crests his haughty head
Will never droop until his heart be dead.
Slower and slower yet his footsep swings,
Wilder and wilder still his death-song rings,
Fiercer and fiercer thro' the forest bounds
His voice that leaps to Happier Hunting Grounds.
One savage yell--
Then loyal to his race,
He bends to death--butnever to disgrace."
2393,Emotion,RedPoemsRedTiledRoofPoembyRobertWilliamService,"Poets may praise a wattle thatch
Doubtfully waterproof;
Let me uplift my lowly latch
Beneath a rose-tiled roof.
Let it be gay and rich in hue,
Soft bleached by burning days,
Where skies ineffably are blue,
And seas a golden glaze.
But set me in the surly North
Beneath a roof of slate,
And as I sourly sally forth
My heart will hum with hate;
And I will brood beneath a pine
Where Nature seldom smiles,
Heart-longing for a starry vine
And roof of ruddy tiles.
For oh the South's a bonny clime
And sunshine is its life;
So there I'll finish up my time
A stranger unto strife.
And smoke my pipe and sit aloof
From care by miles and miles,
Sagaciously beneath a roof,
Geranium-gay and panic proof,
Of ruby tinted tiles."
2394,Emotion,RedPoemsRedLipsAreNotSoRedPoembyWilfredOwen,"Red lips are not so red
As the stained stones kissed by the English dead.
Kindness of wooed and wooer
Seems shame to their love pure.
O Love, your eyes lose lure
When I behold eyes blinded in my stead!
Your slender attitude
Trembles not exquisite like limbs knife-skewed,
Rolling and rolling there
Where God seems not to care;
Till the fierce Love they bear
Cramps them in death's extreme decrepitude.
Your voice sings not so soft, --
Though even as wind murmuring through raftered loft, --
Your dear voice is not dear,
Gentle, and evening clear,
As theirs whom none now hear
Now earth has stopped their piteous mouths that coughed.
Heart, you were never hot,
Nor large, nor full like hearts made great with shot;
And though your hand be pale,
Paler are all which trail
Your cross through flame and hail:
Weep, you may weep, for you may touch them not."

The care of each theme's wording to the test

2396,Emotion,RedPoemsTheVanishingRedPoembyRobertFrost,"He is said to have been the last Red man
In Action. And the Miller is said to have laughed--
If you like to call such a sound a laugh.
But he gave no one else a laugher's license.
For he turned suddenly grave as if to say,
'Whose business,--if I take it on myself,
Whose business--but why talk round the barn?--
When it's just that I hold with getting a thing done with.'
You can't get back and see it as he saw it.
It's too long a story to go into now.
You'd have to have been there and lived it.
They you wouldn't have looked on it as just a matter
Of who began it between the two races.
Some guttural exclamation of surprise
The Red man gave in poking about the mill
Over the great big thumping shuffling millstone
Disgusted the Miller physically as coming
From one who had no right to be heard from.
'Come, John,' he said, 'you want to see the wheel-pint?'
He took him down below a cramping rafter,
And showed him, through a manhole in the floor,
The water in desperate straits like frantic fish,
Salmon and sturgeon, lashing with their tails.
The he shut down the trap door with a ring in it
That jangled even above the general noise,
And came upstairs alone--and gave that laugh,
And said something to a man with a meal-sack
That the man with the meal-sack didn't catch--then.
Oh, yes, he showed John the wheel-pit all right."
2397,Emotion,RedPoemsTheRedHousePoembyHannahSmith,"Sudden as a mirror, the red house
jumped from behind fluffed trees;
windowed four-square and flat slated
violet as final clouds, it seemed,
(or was, so solid its broad gesture) ,
a brick god chapped with litanies.
And there I was born, not I, but rather
the name of my face, the learned, caught
habits of sufference;  below
the slope of the narrow roof were formed
the tribal totems that hard words
have since tabooed, evaded, sought.
Come on it suddenly as a mirror
there at the road's turn, it was so
locked and fenced that, a blank neighbour
caught in an intimacy he knows
outside his role, I watched a boy
at last turn on his heel and go."

2399,Emotion,RedPoemsAChildInRedDirtPoembyMarilynLott,"He was just a little kid
In a kid’s kind of world
Examining the places
Where the red dirt swirled
Hills and little trenches
To climb and investigate
Thoughts and visions
For a child to create
There’s no better place
For a youngster to enjoy
Than in the red dirt country
They don’t even need a toy
Just old-fashioned imagination
That all little children possess
Tucked into their little heads
Many things they can access
There’s nothing like watching
A child in a world of red dirt
Let’s imagine we’re a kid again
You know, it wouldn’t hurt!"
2400,Emotion,RedPoemsChildInRedPoembyRainerMariaRilke,"Sometimes she walks through the village in her
little red dress
all absorbed in restraining herself,
and yet, despite herself, she seems to move
according to the rhythm of her life to come.
She runs a bit, hesitates, stops,
half-turns around...
and, all while dreaming, shakes her head
for or against.
Then she dances a few steps
that she invents and forgets,
no doubt finding out that life
moves on too fast.
It's not so much that she steps out
of the small body enclosing her,
but that all she carries in herself
frolics and ferments.
It's this dress that she'll remember
later in a sweet surrender;
when her whole life is full of risks,
the little red dress will always seem right."
2401,Emotion,RedPoemsRedRedGoldPoembyWilfridScawenBlunt,"Red, red gold, a kingdom's ransom, child,
To weave thy yellow hair she bade them spin.
At early dawn the gossamer spiders toiled,
And wove the sunrise in.
She took the treasures of the deep blue noon,
She took the clear eyes of the morning star,
The pale--faced lilies of a seven--days moon,
The dust of Phoebus' car.
She painted thee with dewdrops from the flowers,
Stained with their petals, hyacinth and rose,
And violets all wet with April showers
And snowdrops from the snows."
2402,Emotion,RedPoemsAmongTheRedGunsPoembyCarlSandburg,"Among the red guns,
In the hearts of soldiers
Running free blood
In the long, long campaign:
Dreams go on.
Among the leather saddles,
In the heads of soldiers
Heavy in the wracks and kills
Of all straight fighting:
Dreams go on.
Among the hot muzzles,
In the hands of soldiers
Brought from flesh-folds of women--
Soft amid the blood and crying--
In all your hearts and heads
Among the guns and saddles and muzzles:
Dreams,
Dreams go on,
Out of the dead on their backs,
Broken and no use any more:
Dreams of the way and the end go on."
2403,Emotion,RedPoemsTheCrowingOfTheRedCockPoembyEmmaLazarus,"Across the Eastern sky has glowed
The flicker of a blood-red dawn,
Once more the clarion cock has crowed,
Once more the sword of Christ is drawn.
A million burning rooftrees light
The world-wide path of Israel's flight.
Where is the Hebrew's fatherland?
The folk of Christ is sore bestead;
The Son of Man is bruised and banned,
Nor finds whereon to lay his head.
His cup is gall, his meat is tears,
His passion lasts a thousand years.
Each crime that wakes in man the beast,
Is visited upon his kind.
The lust of mobs, the greed of priest,
The tyranny of kings, combined
To root his seed from earth again,
His record is one cry of pain.
When the long roll of Christian guilt
Against his sires and kin is known,
The flood of tears, the life-blood spilt,
The agony of ages shown,
What oceans can the stain remove,
From Christian law and Christian love?
Nay, close the book; not now, not here,
The hideous tale of sin narrate,
Reëchoing in the martyr's ear,
Even he might nurse revengeful hate,
Even he might turn in wrath sublime,
With blood for blood and crime for crime.
Coward? Not he, who faces death,
Who singly against worlds has fought,
For what? A name he may not breathe,
For liberty of prayer and thought.
The angry sword he will not whet,
His nobler task is -- to forget."
2404,Emotion,RedPoemsARedFlowerPoembyClaudeMcKay,"Your lips are like a southern lily red,
Wet with the soft rain-kisses of the night,
In which the brown bee buries deep its head,
When still the dawn's a silver sea of light.
Your lips betray the secret of your soul,
The dark delicious essence that is you,
A mystery of life, the flaming goal
I seek through mazy pathways strange and new.
Your lips are the red symbol of a dream,
What visions of warm lilies they impart,
That line the green bank of a fair blue stream,
With butterflies and bees close to each heart!
Brown bees that murmur sounds of music rare,
That softly fall upon the langourous breeze,
Wafting them gently on the quiet air
Among untended avenues of trees.
O were I hovering, a bee, to probe
Deep down within your scented heart, fair flower,
Enfolded by your soft vermilion robe,
Amorous of sweets, for but one perfect hour!"

All worldly passions set below
To bear immortal love
Then fetch me thus a Lotus flower
That I may see the dawn
Upon its leaf a dewdrop set

O bring to me a Lily, white,
To lay upon my breast
To place it gentlly `cross my heart

But these warnings just focus our attention on the wickedness of man.
Look and see how we have let sin and immorality prosper in our land,
Should we not be more concerned about God's Righteous Uplifted Hand?
The fears from wars and rumors of wars are simply a sign of the end,
However, the extent of man's wickedness is indeed limited my friend.
Why have such fears of man who can only kill the body but do no more?
And fear not The Lord who can assign you to Eternal Hell forevermore.
Man continues to kill because of his depraved heart filled with sin,
But God must judge wickedness, because of His Righteousness within.
My friend, if you just humble your heart and fear God instead of man,
Through His Spirit He will open your eyes to His Loving Eternal Plan.
God's Will is for all to come to repentance and through Him be saved,
However, God must still judge those who remain wicked and depraved.
You can continue to fear man and have your heart filled with strife,
Or repent and accept Christ in your heart, and receive Eternal Life.
I don't fear any man, for at death I shall be present with The Lord,
With no fear of God, you'll live without Him, this you can't afford.
Life on this earth is quite brief, while Eternal Life is quite long,
So don't continue fearing man, only to find out you were wrong.

2410,Emotion,RedPoemsLittleRedRidingWhoreAdultPoembyAnthonyLund,"Walking to Grandma’s house was such a chore
For nymphomaniac Little Red Riding Whore
The woods were boring and devoid of decent men
So she had to stop to finger herself every now and again
There was even a passing branch that looked so strong
She had to straddle it’s length and slide it in past her thong
There were dangers in the woods Riding Whore had been told
Of a vicious man eating wolf whose blood was cold
Riding Whore had no fear of such creatures of the night
Her only fear was not getting shagged before the morning light
In a part of the forest where the trees grew high and dark
From beside her Riding Whore heard a low rumbling bark
The wolf was on her in a flash snapping jaws at her throat
But all Riding Whore could think was “What a sexy soft coat”
She avoided the wolf’s bite with a fraction of an inch to spare
She reached down between his legs searching around in his hair
The unfortunate wolf couldn’t have known what was going on
Before Riding Whore had him on his back with a raging hardon
She pinned the wolf down with a frightening strength for a girl
And fucked the wolf so hard his hair began to curl
When  she finally came, her cry rang loud in the air
But after masturbating all day she didn’t really care
She climbed off the wolf and dusted herself down
Began to walk away, then turned back with a frown
The wolf lay still, there was no need to check pulse or breath
She was impressed with herself for she had fucked him to death
So on she went to her Grandma’s house, one thing in her mind on the track
‘I wonder if he had any brothers that wolf who could do me on the way back? ’"
2411,Emotion,RedPoemsARedPalmPoembyGarySoto,"You're in this dream of cotton plants.
You raise a hoe, swing, and the first weeds
Fall with a sigh. You take another step,
Chop, and the sigh comes again,
Until you yourself are breathing that way
With each step, a sigh that will follow you into town.
That's hours later. The sun is a red blister
Coming up in your palm. Your back is strong,
Young, not yet the broken chair
In an abandoned school of dry spiders.
Dust settles on your forehead, dirt
Smiles under each fingernail.
You chop, step, and by the end of the first row,
You can buy one splendid fish for wife
And three sons. Another row, another fish,
Until you have enough and move on to milk,
Bread, meat. Ten hours and the cupboards creak.
You can rest in the back yard under a tree.
Your hands twitch on your lap,
Not unlike the fish on a pier or the bottom
Of a boat. You drink iced tea. The minutes jerk
Like flies.
It's dusk, now night,
And the lights in your home are on.
That costs money, yellow light
In the kitchen. That's thirty steps,
You say to your hands,
Now shaped into binoculars.
You could raise them to your eyes:
You were a fool in school, now look at you.
You're a giant among cotton plants.
Now you see your oldest boy, also running.
Papa, he says, it's time to come in.
You pull him into your lap
And ask, What's forty times nine?
He knows as well as you, and you smile.
The wind makes peace with the trees,
The stars strike themselves in the dark.
You get up and walk with the sigh of cotton plants.
You go to sleep with a red sun on your palm,
The sore light you see when you first stir in bed."
2412,Emotion,RedPoemsTheBalladOfTheRedEarlPoembyRudyardKipling,"It is not for them to criticize too minutely the methods the Irish followed, though they might deplore some of their results. During the past few years Ireland had been going through what was tantamount to a revolution. -- EARL SPENCER
Red Earl, and will ye take for guide
The silly camel-birds,
That ye bury your head in an Irish thorn,
On a desert of drifting words?
Ye have followed a man for a God, Red Earl,
As the Lord o' Wrong and Right;
But the day is done with the setting sun
Will ye follow into the night?
He gave you your own old words, Red Earl,
For food on the wastrel way;
Will ye rise and eat in the night, Red Earl,
That fed so full in the day?
Ye have followed fast, ye have followed far,
And where did the wandering lead?
From the day that ye praised the spoken word
To the day ye must gloss the deed.
And as ye have given your hand for gain,
So must ye give in loss;
And as ye ha' come to the brink of the pit,
So must ye loup across.
For some be rogues in grain, Red Earl,
And some be rogues in fact,
And rogues direct and rogues elect;
But all be rogues in pact.
Ye have cast your lot with these, Red Earl;
Take heed to where ye stand.
Ye have tied a knot with your tongue, Red Earl,
That ye cannot loose with your hand.
Ye have travelled fast, ye have travelled far,
In the grip of a tightening tether,
Till ye find at the end ye must take for friend
The quick and their dead together.
Ye have played with the Law between your lips,
And mouthed it daintilee;
But the gist o' the speech is ill to teach,
For ye say: ""Let wrong go free.""
Red Earl, ye wear the Garter fair,
And gat your place from a King:
Do ye make Rebellion of no account,
And Treason a little thing?
And have ye weighed your words, Red Earl,
That stand and speak so high?
And is it good that the guilt o' blood,
Be cleared at the cost of a sigh?
And is it well for the sake of peace,
Our tattered Honour to sell,
And higgle anew with a tainted crew --
Red Earl, and is it well?
Ye have followed fast, ye have followed far,
On a dark and doubtful way,
And the road is hard, is hard, Red Earl,
And the price is yet to pay.
Ye shall pay that price as ye reap reward
For the toil of your tongue and pen --
In the praise of the blamed and the thanks of the shamed,
And the honour o' knavish men.
They scarce shall veil their scorn, Red Earl,
And the worst at the last shall be,
When you tell your heart that it does not know
And your eye that it does not see."
2413,Emotion,RedPoemsMyRedRedRosesPoembyMarilynLott,"So beautiful and so fragrant
I'm so proud of them, you see

Some of the very best!"
2414,Emotion,RedPoemsAcrossTheRedSkyPoembyKatherineMansfield,"Across the red sky two birds flying,
Flying with drooping wings.
Silent and solitary their ominous flight.
All day the triumphant sun with yellow banners
Warred and warred with the earth, and when she yielded
Stabbed her heart, gathered her blood in a chalice,
Spilling it over the evening sky.
When the dark plumaged birds go flying, flying,
Quiet lies the earth wrapt in her mournful shadow,
Her sightless eyes turned to the red sky
And the restlessly seeking birds."
2415,Emotion,RedPoemsTheWhiteShipsAndTheRedPoembyJoyceKilmer,"(For Alden March)
With drooping sail and pennant
That never a wind may reach,
They float in sunless waters
Beside a sunless beach.
Their mighty masts and funnels
Are white as driven snow,
And with a pallid radiance
Their ghostly bulwarks glow.
Here is a Spanish galleon
That once with gold was gay,
Here is a Roman trireme
Whose hues outshone the day.
But Tyrian dyes have faded,
And prows that once were bright
With rainbow stains wear only
Death's livid, dreadful white.
White as the ice that clove her
That unforgotten day,
Among her pallid sisters
The grim Titanic lay.
And through the leagues above her
She looked aghast, and said:
""What is this living ship that comes
Where every ship is dead?""
The ghostly vessels trembled
From ruined stern to prow;
What was this thing of terror
That broke their vigil now?
Down through the startled ocean
A mighty vessel came,
Not white, as all dead ships must be,
But red, like living flame!
The pale green waves about her
Were swiftly, strangely dyed,
By the great scarlet stream that flowed
From out her wounded side.
And all her decks were scarlet
And all her shattered crew.
She sank among the white ghost ships
And stained them through and through.
The grim Titanic greeted her
""And who art thou?"" she said;
""Why dost thou join our ghostly fleet
Arrayed in living red?
We are the ships of sorrow
Who spend the weary night,
Until the dawn of Judgment Day,
Obscure and still and white.""
""Nay,"" said the scarlet visitor,
""Though I sink through the sea,
A ruined thing that was a ship,
I sink not as did ye.
For ye met with your destiny
By storm or rock or fight,
So through the lagging centuries
Ye wear your robes of white.
""But never crashing iceberg
Nor honest shot of foe,
Nor hidden reef has sent me
The way that I must go.
My wound that stains the waters,
My blood that is like flame,
Bear witness to a loathly deed,
A deed without a name.
""I went not forth to battle,
I carried friendly men,
The children played about my decks,
The women sang -- and then --
And then -- the sun blushed scarlet
And Heaven hid its face,
The world that God created
Became a shameful place!
""My wrong cries out for vengeance,
The blow that sent me here
Was aimed in Hell.  My dying scream
Has reached Jehovah's ear.
Not all the seven oceans
Shall wash away that stain;
Upon a brow that wears a crown
I am the brand of Cain.""
When God's great voice assembles
The fleet on Judgment Day,
The ghosts of ruined ships will rise
In sea and strait and bay.
Though they have lain for ages
Beneath the changeless flood,
They shall be white as silver,
But one -- shall be like blood."

He never was lonely again,
For often he caught that fragrance so sweet
And knew she was still close to him.
Then, one evening, she came with arms outstretched
As she beckoned, ""it's time, dear, to go.""
He breathed his last breath and followed her,
Through the years he had loved her so.
When they found his cold body next morning
His face set in peaceful repose,
Someone said, ""What's this?"" and on the floor,
Lay the petals of a lovely red rose."

When I return we’ll start our day.

a glimpse of your shadow mystically near.
Dream my darling dream as only you can
Listen to the song birds, hold them in your hand

Fell to my knees and called out your name.
You left me that morning in a faded red dress.
Dreams of a future never will be blessed.
Dream my darling dream as only you can
Listen to the song birds, hold them in your hand
Now all I have left are the sweet memories,
of a beautiful woman, who composed my heart.

Be mine, If near or far
Remember too my love for you
And stay the way you are
I miss you and the days grow long
When you are out of touch
So take this rose and always know
I love you dear, so much
Give a thought to me each day
Love as not passed you by
Feed your rose with teardrops
If to love me makes you cry
There will be no love stronger
A love known by so few
From the one, who gives you this red rose
And all it means to you
Good luck, good health, God bless dear
May I see you every day
Pray my love be always with you
Till the last rose, fades away."
2420,Emotion,RedPoemsTheRedDoorPoembyAJMcKinley,"Closeted I stare at this red door.
Ajar, but as open to me as a vault.
My nightmare is my salvation.
Silence now awakening, keeping me distraught.
Reaching out, I wonder, am I within a dream?
Surreal, languid, and impatient is my eternity.
Crying effortlessly, I grasp what is not real.
Abrupt realization that I can no longer see.
Starving, I face a feast of emotion
turning green with mold and decay.
Wondering if yesterday is my tomorrow,
or if my tomorrow is tortured delay.
Fuming with my desires so depleted.
My song bursts into dirges for peace.
A warrior facing the last battle.
The rose in winter can never be me.
Alone with my red door with keys in each hand.
Twisting, turning, yet no key fits inside.
Silent indignation of my caged facade.
Pain beyond redemption walks at my side.

2421,Emotion,RedPoemsRedHanrahansSongAboutIrelandPoembyWilliamButlerYeats,"THE old brown thorn-trees break in two high over Cummen Strand,
Under a bitter black wind that blows from the left hand;
Our courage breaks like an old tree in a black wind and dies,
But we have hidden in our hearts the flame out of the eyes
Of Cathleen, the daughter of Houlihan.
The wind has bundled up the clouds high over Knock- narea,
And thrown the thunder on the stones for all that Maeve can say.
Angers that are like noisy clouds have set our hearts abeat;
But we have all bent low and low and kissed the quiet feet
Of Cathleen, the daughter of Houlihan.
The yellow pool has overflowed high up on Clooth-na-Bare,
For the wet winds are blowing out of the clinging air;
Like heavy flooded waters our bodies and our blood;
But purer than a tall candle before the Holy Rood
Is Cathleen, the daughter of Houlihan."

I am a galloping horse to ride.
I am a growling tiger and ready to collide!
I am a roaring lion with pride.
Hi! Hi! Comrade cheerio!  Comrade
Hiya! Hiya! Comrade, bon-voyage comrade!
I am a thunder bolt! I am a wonder volt!
They may have fire,
But I am a cease-fire and live-wire.
Tire! Tire! I never retire.
I am a hail storm and acid rain.
I am victimized comrade but not thrashed brain,
Hello! Hello! My name is revolution!
Solution! Solution! As your heart is pollution!
Marxist, Maoist, Castroist and I – a Leninist
Guevarist, Titoist, Trotskyist, and I – a Stalinist.
Naxalite, syndicalist, extremist, and I, a revolutionist;
Bolshie, commie, and radical; why these words of spade bit!
Leftist, socialist, communist and I, a humanist fit!
Revolt is my style! Struggle is my file.
In battle, I am grown……
Maoism is my crown.

I watch it swaying and jerking, as it enters the atmosphere,
Lost sadly to this earth of ours, it now says a last goodbye,
Sailing towards the fleecy clouds, it invites the wind to steer.
Had a small hand let go the string, so escape was rather fast,
Twirling away, those powerful currents assuring a final climb.
Slowly receding into the blue, disappearing back to the past,
Lost in that extensive vast place, a gap in space and time.
Unencumbered now, it unhurriedly continues to journey on,
Perhaps it was a child's treasure, a simple pleasing thing,
Thinking about it, to whom I wonder, did it once belong,
This red balloon, that's floating with a trailing broken string.

With fragrance that freshens the air,

That heavenly city built of chrysolite.

Aflame with the red splendour, marvelling stand,
And gaze with lifted faces awed and mute.

I drank your milk and filled my mouth
With your home talk, slept in your house
And was one of you.
But a fire burns in my heart.
Under the ribs where pulses thud
And flitting between bones of skull
Is the push, the endless mysterious command,
Saying:
""I leave you behind--
You for the little hills and the years all alike,
You with your patient cows and old houses
Protected from the rain,
I am going away and I never come back to you;
Crags and high rough places call me,
Great places of death
Where men go empty handed
And pass over smiling
To the star-drift on the horizon rim.
My last whisper shall be alone, unknown;
I shall go to the city and fight against it,
And make it give me passwords
Of luck and love, women worth dying for,
And money.
I go where you wist not of
Nor I nor any man nor woman.
I only know I go to storms
Grappling against things wet and naked.""
There is no pity of it and no blame.
None of us is in the wrong.
After all it is only this:
You for the little hills and I go away."

He didn't even have any arms or legs. He had no stomach and he had no back and he had no spine and he had no innards whatsoever. He had nothing at all!

And there'd be one to see me so
And flip the world away.
And he would be a gallant one,
With stars behind his eyes,
And hair like metal in the sun,
And lips too warm for lies.
I always saw us, gay and good,
High honored in the town.
Now I am grown to womanhood....
I have the silly gown."
2440,Emotion,RedPoemsRedRedRosePoembyBillSimmons,"Red, red rose, she blew her breath
Fingers, it’s stem she caressed
Then she closed her eyes and breathed the fragrance in
Tell me red, red rose, where does love end
She placed the rose, gently against her lips
She plucked a single petal, with finger tips
And as the wind caught and carried up high
Tell me red, red rose, can love it fly
Slowly one by one, each petal fell
Upon the last in her eye, a tear it swelled
And then she sighed as she asked to her self
Tell me red, red rose, is for love, is this what’s left
Red, red rose, red, red rose
You stand for love you should know
Should we hold on tight with all our might
Must one day we let go
Red, red rose, red, red rose
Your petals fly in the breeze
If I let go, red, red rose
What becomes of me.

2441,Emotion,RedPoemsTearsOfRedPoembyWikidJay,"Sitting on the curb
Wondering why she does this-it was her
Pale, skin grave
Holding a razorblade
Crying of tears
Mixed with blood
Why was she still here?
She told herself she must
Remembering his arms around her
Said, ' I love you'
How lonely I felt
When he left me with nothing but a pool
A pool full of water
From my tears it formed
A pool of depression at my heart
I'll drown in it while i'm torn
I'm sitting here, at the curb
With my razorblade
He stares at me and says ' you bleed pretty '
When i do nothing but bleed
I turn my right arm over
Let it rest in my skin
Let it bleed until I die
The pain thats in glisten
Despair
Sanity
Anguish
Su icide it screams
Today I die and here I lie
From the wrists I bleed"
2442,Emotion,RedPoemsBlackOrWhiteTheBloodIsRedPoembyRajaramRamachandran,"Is the Black man’s blood black,
Or the Black Crow’s blood black?
Is the White Man’s blood white,
Or the White Dove’s blood white?
Why it’s red, any one immaterial?
‘Cause God wants to be impartial
To treat all the creatures equal,
What a display of His creative marvel!
Red, blue, white or yellow
Violet, green, orange or indigo
How all flowers look so bright
When seen in one bunch tight?
The nature’s plural color scheme,
Doesn’t it free the eyes from boredom?
What an immeasurable thing of joy
It gives as a gift of the Almighty?
The color by morn, a flower drops
When by nightfall, out it withers.
The beauty of a Black or White
Fades away by age overnight.
Mind not the color of the skin
But the blood that’s in common.
Respect every God’s creation
That’ll lead the world to salvation."
2443,Emotion,RedPoemsASingleRedRosePoembyDavidHarris,"A single red rose
lays on a grave,
for someone buried there.
It spoke of love,
that would always remain strong,
even though the loved one was now gone.
It spoke of something lasting,
beyond our living days.
Tells the story about love
that never ever fades away.
The love that seeds devotion,
even after death.
That single red rose spoke to me,
of all the things, we cherish most,
and how much each of us.
Would like to have
that loving care,
with a single red rose for all to see and share.

But do you recall the most tele-evangelist of all,

You would ever say it glows.
All of the evangelists
Used to laugh and call him names,
They never let poor Bakker
Join in tax evasion games.

2445,Emotion,RedPoemsTheRedPoppyPoembyLouiseGluck,"The great thing
is not having
a mind. Feelings:
oh, I have those; they
govern me. I have
a lord in heaven
called the sun, and open
for him, showing him
the fire of my own heart, fire
like his presence.
What could such glory be
if not a heart? Oh my brothers and sisters,
were you like me once, long ago,
before you were human? Did you
permit yourselves
to open once, who would never
open again? Because in truth
I am speaking now
the way you do. I speak

2446,Emotion,RedPoemsISeeRedPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"In a moment of silence
I ponder
Thinking of the pressure that I’m under
Should I resort to violence?
I see red like a blood thirsty vampire
I feel red like a hot faced town crier
It is as if I've been hit with a set of pliers
While disappointed in the one I used to admire
Yesterday before and after I went to bed
I dreamt of nothing else but the dead
I saw a vision of the rolling of heads
You've stabbed me and I have bled
My eyes are still steaming hot and red
These vicious rumours that you've spread
While I blindly followed and you led
Now I question myself instead
Of all the things that have been said
Have I knowingly been misled?
Without recognising what was ahead
I know positive thoughts I must embed
Peace is the message we want widespread
Not red with more bloodshed
What is really weird, is whenever we see  red
That negative vision can so easily be shred"

I am a red rebel.........
I am in trouble and in double.
From here does my revolution spread.
As I wed blood and a rebellion dead.
I am dying spirit of my fellow comrades.
I am a lover of swords and Marx words.
I spill my blood in the dark deep woods;
Social change is my goal, I'm a tool.
Societal change is my soul, I'm no fool!
If I open my mouth war is not far.
As a child I did not slide on saar.
So far, I know only a war for heaven's sake
I can't sneak like a thief or slither like snake!

Hello! Hello! Fellow class!
I did not pass, I am mass, ma! Ma! Mass.
Karl Marx, Fredric Angel, Mao is my boss;
Gun is my friend and pen is my property.
I will fight and fight till I create history.
But I died in fowl encounter and under mystery.
Remember my words we cannot be calm,
Keep chanting, “Salaam! Salaam! Comrade lal salaam! ”
You moved heaven and earth bye, bye comrade!
Let me bid you adieu with bon-voyage Comrade!

Why can't i just be dead,
I need to free the hurt inside,
So I cry my tears of red.
I watch the blood flow thick and fast,
As I cut deeper every day,
I open up my body,
To bleed my pain away
My body is engraved,
With the emotions of my heart,
My skin's the story of my soul,
I'm a living work of art.
The words read red and clear,
As more blood starts to flow,
I'm holding on to life right now,
But soon I'll let it go.
What have I got to live for,
But to hack into my skin?
Soon I'll make that final cut,
And end all that's within.

2453,Emotion,RedPoemsBattleOfRedCliffPoembySuTungpo,"The Yangtze flows east
Washing away
A thousand ages of great men
West of the ramparts --
People say --
Are the fabled Red Cliffs of young Chou of the Three Kingdoms
Rebellious rocks pierce the sky
Frightening waves rip the bank
The backwash churns vast snowy swells --
River and mountains like a painting
how many heroes passed them, once ...
Think back to those years, Chou Yu --
Just married to the younger Chiao --
Brave, brilliant
With plumed fan, silk kerchief
Laughed and talked
While masts and oars vanished to flying ash and smoke!
I roam through ancient realms
Absurdly moved
Turn gray too soon --
A man's life passes like a dream --
Pour out a cup then, to the river, and the moon
Translation 2
The endless river eastward flows;
With its huge waves are gone all those
Gallant heroes of bygone years.
West of the ancient fortress years
Red Cliff where General Zhou Yu won his early fame
When the Three Kingdoms were in flame.
Jugged rocks tower in the air
And swashing waves beat on the air
Rolling up a thousand heaps of snow.
To match the hills and the river so fair,
How many heroes brave of yore
Made a great show!
Translation 3
The great river surges east,
Its waves have scoured away
Since time began all traces of heroic men.
The western side of the old fort
Was once, so people say,
Known as the Red Cliff of Zhou of the Three Kingdoms.
With piled-up rocks to stab the sky
And waves to shake them thunderously
Churning the frothy mass to mounds of snow,
It's like a masterpiece in paint.
Those ages hide how many a hero!
Think back to those old days;
that first year when Zhou Yu had just  married  the Young Qiao.
Then, what a hero he became!
With waving fan and silken cap
He talked and laughed at ease
While masts and oars were blotted out in smoke and flame!
My wits that stray to realms of old
Deserve the scorn of all who feel;
Years pass, and hair grows white so soon.
Though a man's life is like a dream,
One toast continues still -- the River and the Moon!"
2454,Emotion,RedPoemsTheRedFlowerPoembyHenryVanDyke,"In the pleasant time of Pentecost,
By the little river Kyll,
I followed the angler's winding path
Or waded the stream at will,
And the friendly fertile German land
Lay round me green and still.
But all day long on the eastern bank
Of the river cool and clear,
Where the curving track of the double rails
Was hardly seen though near,
The endless trains of German troops
Went rolling down to Trier.
They packed the windows with bullet heads
And caps of hodden gray;
They laughed and sang and shouted loud
When the trains were brought to a stay;
They waved their hands and sang again
As they went on their iron way.
No shadow fell on the smiling land,
No cloud arose in the sky;
I could hear the river's quiet tune
When the trains had rattled by;
But my heart sank low with a heavy sense
Of trouble,- I knew not why.
Then came I into a certain field
Where the devil's paint-brush spread
'Mid the gray and green of the rolling hills
A flaring splotch of red,-
An evil omen, a bloody sign,
And a token of many dead.
I saw in a vision the field-gray horde
Break forth at the devil's hour,
And trample the earth into crimson mud
In the rage of the Will to Power,-
All this I dreamed in the valley of Kyll,
At the sign of the blood-red flower."

For the cry of our mates when the sambhur has wheeled and is

For the risk and the riot of night!
For the sleep at the lair-mouth by day!
It is met, and we go to the fight.

Let us make strong in a chain all the love bases

Brings a smile instead of a frown

But now you know and can plainly see
It's a treasure right from a vineyard!"

2459,Emotion,RedPoemsTheSongOfTheRedManPoembyHenryClayWork,"When the palefaces came in their whitewing'd canoes,
Long ago, from the sun-rising sea
When they ask'd for a lodge, and we did not refuse
Happy then was the red man, and free.
He could then choose a spot for his wigwam to stand,
Where the forest was crowded with game;
For the blue-rolling lake and the ever smiling land
Were his own till the palefaces came
For the broad grassy plains and the forests deep and grand,
Were his own till the palefaces came.
They came! they came! like the fierce prairie flame,
Sweeping on to the sun-setting shore:
Gazing now on its waves, but a handful of braves,
We shall join in the the chase nevermore
Till we camp on the plains where the Great Spirit reigns,
We shall join in the chase nevermore.
We receiv'd them with gladness, as Sons of the Sky
We believ'd them of heavenly birth;
But alas! to our sorrow we found by and by,
That like us they were born of the earth.
By their false traders wrong'd, by their firewater craz'd,
There was no one our braves to restrain;
So the swift flew, and the tomahawk was raise'd
While we both mourn'd the blood of our slain;
So the smoke-wreath did cease from the calumet of peace,
While we both mourn'd the blood of our slain.
When the oaks, pines and cedars were fell'd to the ground,
'Twas a sight that with sorrow we saw;
For the game fled affrighted, and no food was found
For the old chief, the papoose and squaw.
Driven westward we came, but the paleface was here,
With his sharp axe and death-flashing gun;
And his great iron horse is rumbling in the rear
""O, my brave men!"" your journey is done.
Like the beaver and elk like the buffalo and deer
""O, my brave men!"" your journey is done."

If you look to Sir Alex Ferguson eyes
You will be relaxed to victor the match
Lets teach Chelsea how the win comes easily when we play against them
Chelsea is nothing without Drogba or who was fasting the goal in the world cup
Chelsea like the lady without a baby without them
Lets told them no champions league again
The champions for red demon only…..
There's no team in the world can face them
Or, to stop in them face
All the soccer there  have an ambitious to win as stone
If you want a goal just pass the ball to golden boy or the player of the show
They're ready to do that all the time
If you want the ball next to  the goal just mention to Giggs that
If you don’t wont any goal against you just give Van dar sar attention before the match
If you want more show just give Ronaldo a signal to do that

2462,Emotion,RedPoemsThePumpingJungleThroughWhichTheRedHeartsLovePoembyRobertRorabeck,"The fidelity of the day
Runs along the chrome gills
Of her highway,
The glitter of a stream
Disappears in the shade,
When she tells you, you
Do not know her.
When she slips off
For other men, your
Dear brothers,
Going around the bend,
She does not look back
But cascades
In the tangled memories
Of skin and bone laced
With skin and bone
The defeated sun
Kneels beneath the
Horizon’s teeth to
Shatter, and fall
Steaming into the sea,
The gift of the craftsman
Wasted before honed
When the city becomes the
Jungle,
Private detectives working
Overtime
Gunned down without audience
On unseen intersections
Before all the ladies
Opening their doors,
Going out on the walk for the evening,
The skin of their legs flowing
Like running facets
Cooling the parched eyes
Of men, their bodies lighting up
The safety of nightlights
Next to the bedroom,
The doors left open,
Inviting
With All the husbands gone
On very long and expensive trips
With the objects they wish to posses,
Humid and beginning to swim,
Women become the sea-wolves,
The bones of their bodies learn to
Breath through the touch of skins,
Burning through the ancient fires
Of survival
The glass roof above where
The commercial airlines
Fly, comes down
The dryads uncoil their forms
Swim through the muted clouds
Sweating, rings slip from fingers
Fangs, like roots, moisten
In dark corners paid for by the hour,
Friends make love to old lovers
Again,
Back at home,
Locked,
Old lovers stand alone
Hand in hand with a
Gun
Kissing
Where the sun plummets
Through the caves,
Settling amidst the wrecks,
The hopeless hearts,
Forgotten and undisturbed,
Where the greatest man lies
Beneath green green grass,
Nameless,
Not even an allusion of movement
In the graveyard of the deepest
Bay,
Discarded by the pumping jungle
Through which the red hearts love."

A gown of white she did wear
With a bouquet of red roses
And blue ribbons in her hair

Who was never to come
Tears leaked from her eyes
Across her cheeks did run
The bouquet of red roses
For her wedding day
Have all now faded
As time slipped away
Those faded red roses
She still holds in her hand
Years have come and gone
Waiting for this man
You’ll still find her
With tears in her eyes
As the hopes he’ll still come
Fade like the roses
Washed too much by the sun
Today she still waits all alone
Those faded red roses in her hand
Is now all that she owns"

2465,Emotion,RedPoemsColorMeRedPoembyStarrWilliams,"Red is deep anger that never comes out
Red is believing, and then having doubt.
Red reeks of revenge, of suffering and hate.
Red is being thirsty and having to wait.
Red, in a painting, makes one hot and confused,
It’s the anger of crying when you feel you’ve been used.
Red is that voice, deep in your head,
It could keep you back, but pushes ahead.
It mocks you silently with a voice full of hate,
“You can’t do it, you are weak, and it is your fate.”
Red feels like fire, singeing your heart,
It’s wanting to be together, but having to part.
Red is running through desert and sun,
It’s needing a friend, but having none.
Red is the heart that’s been broken in two,
It’s hearing those lies, and wanting what’s true."

Red is the sweltering Sahara desert
Red is the colour of a ripe cherry resting on a dollop of cream

Red is the R&B music
Red is a colour that is safe and alive."
2470,Emotion,RedPoemsRedDustPoembyPhilipLevine,"This harpie with dry red curls
talked openly of her husband,
his impotence, his death, the death
of her lover, the birth and death
of her own beauty. She stared
into the mirror next to
our table littered with the wreck
of her appetite and groaned:
Look what you've done to me!
as though only that moment
she'd discovered her own face.
Look, and she shoved the burden
of her ruin on the waiter.
I do not believe in sorrow;
it is not American.
At 8,000 feet the towns
of this blond valley smoke
like the thin pipes of the Chinese,
and I go higher where the air
is clean, thin, and the underside
of light is clearer than the light.
Above the tree line the pines
crowd below like moments of the past
and on above the snow line
the cold underside of my arm,
the half in shadow, sweats with fear
as though it lay along the edge
of revelation.
And so my mind closes around
a square oil can crushed on the road
one morning, startled it was not
the usual cat. If a crow
had come out of the air to choose
its entrails could I have laughed?
If eagles formed now in the
shocked vegetation of my sight
would they be friendly? I can hear
their wings lifting them down, the feathers
tipped with red dust, that dust which
even here I taste, having eaten it
all these years."

The thing is that they think
it will take them as well,

I do not know where they got the notion
that if you push the back seat down
you can carry triple the amount.
In a minute if they keep going
I will be driving through the sunroof
as there will not be any room
for me in my little red car.

2474,Emotion,RedPoemsTheHuntForRedOctoberPoembyChuckAudette,"a ping rings so slight
off our submarine hull
faces go white
this isn't a drill
the skipper regards us
with a look that is hard
says 'Who dared to bring
their damn credit card? '
'Please sir, it's me sir'
I step forward and 'fess
'You fool! '  he hissed
Your payments you've missed! '
'We'll be drowned in high fees
snagged in red tape
we'll never get free
with their new interest rates! '
'Dive deep! ' he commands
'We're in hot water now!
But we'll try to escape
their collections so foul! '
The pinging grows louder
we sweat and we fret
their intent is avowed
to collect on the debt
Then explosions begin
our position looks bleak
Final notices pour in
through thousands of leaks
'that's the end of us lads
we'll sink no more barges
It seems they are dropping
those bloody late charges! '
The Captain eyes me
bills up to his waist
growls 'this wouldn't have happened
if you'd paid with due haste! '
'Pardon me, Sir' I gasp
in our pocket of air
'these aren't my bills
- that's YOUR name here'
(hope you liked this poetic sub mission, er.. submission!)"
2475,Emotion,RedPoemsB09CrossingTheRedSeaPoembySimpleSimon,"When the king of Egypt,
Let the Israelites go,
God led them not straight
But a roundabout route thro'.
There was a short-cut road;
Yet, a circular way, God preferred,
As in the event of any fight,
They couldn't return to Egypt.
To keep them safe and alert,
He led them thro' the desert,
Trekking o'er the sand,
Towards the Red Sea end.
They were armed for battle,
Ready to fight tooth and nail.
They were very bold this time,
As the Lord was with them.
Joseph's body was in Egypt.
To fulfill his last request,
That his body be taken out,
Moses, with him, brought it.
During the day, as cloud,
God, in front, He led.
Likewise, He went as light,
And led them at night.
Thus, they travelled night and day,
Thro' the God-chosen pathway.
They reached the desert end,
And at Etham, they camped.
What was the picture in Egypt?
The king went in regret
For losing all the slaves,
Who served him for many years.
He took his armed forces
And pursued the Israelites.
He was nearing the camp-site,
With his army ready to fight.
To Moses, the Israelites said,
'Your advice, should we've heard?
Look, what you've done?
Didn't we tell this'll happen? '
'We preferred Egypt's graves,
And remain there as slaves,
Than die here in the desert,
And be thrown in wind and dust.'
Moses assured and said,
'Listen, don't be afraid.
Now, God is on our side.
See the miracle of the Lord.'
To Moses God said,
'Let the people go forward.
Take your stick and lift it.
O'er the sea, you hold it.'
What God said, Moses did.
The sea-water got divided.
They walked on dry ground
Thro' the path, newly found.
Till the last man had crossed,
And other side, they reached,
The sea-ground was open
And God's miracle was on.
With a wave of his stick,
Moses reversed the trick,
When the sea-water closed,
All the enemies were trapped.
The power of the Lord,
The Israelites then realized.
They developed faith in God
And in Moses, the servant of God.
At last, the Egyptians,
Learnt a bitter lesson,
And they had virtually seen,
What God's power had been"

With one black beady eye
Bobbing in the wind
On hairy green stalk
Home to the spider

Cheery wayside friend
Beacon in the mud of Flanders
Flashing danger

Living among the dead

Pinned on my chest
I would rather wear my heart
On my sleeve and say

Gave their life
Rightly—or wrongly
I will remember
I do remember,
Who could forget?"

I
Viola, I'm the galloping horse in a battle,
The trumpeting elephant in a tide,
The growling tiger ready to collide.
I'm in the hail storm of an acid rain,
the roaring lion sets to die in a fire.
Lo, fighting is my Label, a rebel red;
In trouble as I fell with a rhyme triple.
Rulers have the power just to fire, yet
I'm the counter fire, I never retire, but
I died in a foul encounter, a mystery.
For pollution in their hearts I'm the solution;
Hello! My name is revolution,
The thunder bolt and the wonder volt!
From here does mutiny spreads…..
I'm a rebellion dead as the blood I wed.
As a child I didn't play on the saar, so what?
War is not far, my mouth if I open. Tut!
Know not Mozilla yet I mastered warfare guerrilla,
Can't sneak like a thief nor slither like a snake,
But I tone a slogan, ‘hike-hike my life is at stake.'

Hello-hello fellow class, I did not pass,
In the mass I'm one, let me sing for the poor.
Stalin, Lenin, Mao and Chou are my bosses,
Gun is my friend, pen is my property and
I will fight and fight till I create history.
I'm the dying spirit of my fellow comrades,
A lover of swords and words of Karl Marx.
In the deep woods dark, blood I spill.
For reasons known and in seasons myriad
To change the society into selfless one.
I'm the exponent - a Marxist, Maoist and Titoist;
The proponent - a Castroist, Guevarist and Trotskyist;
The revolutionist - an extremist, radicalist and sydicalist.
Quit using spade bit - a bolshie, commie and naxalite
as a Leftist, a communist yet the A-one humanist am I.
Come, come comrade, oh crimson colored commie!
Cheers, do you hear a boisterous welcome? Yo, red -
To, tovarish, with gazillion cockades red, a bonvoyage.
Heaven and earth you moved so let me bid you adieu;
keep chanting - salaam, salaam comrade, lal salaam!"
2480,Emotion,RedPoemsTheRedRosePoembyAbdulSattar,"The red rose wept for long
Upon the autumn sad song
And then recovered from grief
And shattered the wet green leaf
The spring is there but the tears
Of lover, the autumn how bears
The little heart in search of charm
Is beating and beating and warm
The red rose is watching the gloom
Of the lover’s heart being in boom
His beloved had nodded him back
The rose from him she does not take
The nature feeling warmth is now cold
The autumn will take him in firm hold
The beauty will go leaving the scars
Of drowning moon and falling stars
The thorns will curse the rose to retreat
The red rose weeps on nature’s treat
It doesn’t matter what have gone
The rose will wait for the dawn
The spring no more helps the friend
His beauty will shatter like wall of sand
His days of life will end very soon
At morn, at noon or after noon
The rose sees autumn in the spring
A wave of sorrow his end will bring
The red rose weeps and weeps more
Upon these tears his eyes will sore
No spring can stop, no joy can amaze
With each passing moment his death he chase
So times are when autumn comes in spring
No joy can touch you no nerve can sing

2483,Emotion,RedPoemsTheWolfsPostcriptToLittleRedRidingHoodPoembyAghaShahidAli,"First, grant me my sense of history:
I did it for posterity,
for kindergarten teachers
and a clear moral:
Little girls shouldn't wander off
in search of strange flowers,
and they mustn't speak to strangers.
And then grant me my generous sense of plot:
Couldn't I have gobbled her up
right there in the jungle?
Why did I ask her where her grandma lived?
As if I, a forest-dweller,
didn't know of the cottage
under the three oak trees
and the old woman lived there
all alone?
As if I couldn't have swallowed her years before?
And you may call me the Big Bad Wolf,
now my only reputation.
But I was no child-molester
though you'll agree she was pretty.
And the huntsman:
Was I sleeping while he snipped
my thick black fur
and filled me with garbage and stones?
I ran with that weight and fell down,
simply so children could laugh
at the noise of the stones
cutting through my belly,
at the garbage spilling out
with a perfect sense of timing,
just when the tale
should have come to an end."

2486,Emotion,RedPoemsTheBloodRedFourragerePoembyRobertWilliamService,"What was the blackest sight to me
Of all that campaign?
A naked woman tied to a tree
With jagged holes where her breasts should be,
Rotting there in the rain.
On we pressed to the battle fray,
Dogged and dour and spent.
Sudden I heard my Captain say:
""Voilà! Kultur has passed this way,
And left us a monument.""
So I looked and I saw our Colonel there,
And his grand head, snowed with the years,
Unto the beat of the rain was bare;
And, oh, there was grief in his frozen stare,
And his cheeks were stung with tears!
Then at last he turned from the woeful tree,
And his face like stone was set;
""Go, march the Regiment past,"" said he,
""That every father and son may see,
And none may ever forget.""
Oh, the crimson strands of her hair downpoured
Over her breasts of woe;
And our grim old Colonel leaned on his sword,
And the men filed past with their rifles lowered,
Solemn and sad and slow.
But I'll never forget till the day I die,
As I stood in the driving rain,
And the jaded columns of men slouched by,
How amazement leapt into every eye,
Then fury and grief and pain.
And some would like madmen stand aghast,
With their hands upclenched to the sky;
And some would cross themselves as they passed,
And some would curse in a scalding blast,
And some like children cry.
Yea, some would be sobbing, and some would pray,
And some hurl hateful names;
But the best had never a word to say;
They turned their twitching faces away,
And their eyes were like hot flames.
They passed; then down on his bended knee
The Colonel dropped to the Dead:
""Poor martyred daughter of France!"" said he,
""O dearly, dearly avenged you'll be
Or ever a day be sped!""
Now they hold that we are the best of the best,
And each of our men may wear,
Like a gash of crimson across his chest,
As one fierce-proved in the battle-test,
The blood-red Fourragere.
For each as he leaps to the top can see,
Like an etching of blood on his brain,
A wife or a mother lashed to a tree,
With two black holes where her breasts should be,
Left to rot in the rain.
So we fight like fiends, and of us they say
That we neither yield nor spare.
Oh, we have the bitterest debt to pay. . . .
Have we paid it? -- Look -- how we wear to-day
Like a trophy, gallant and proud and gay,
Our blood-red Fourragere."

I'm growing impatient now;

in my siren red strapless.
(The men say, 'Hello, Beautiful.')
I see you parking now, late as ever.
You're on the driver's side
of a blood-red Ferrari.
(I always thought that car was beautiful.)
You're stepping out of the car,
And walking to the other side
To hold open the red door.
(A gentleman...how beautiful.)
A woman steps out of the car:
A vixen if I ever saw one,
White smile parting shiny red lips.
(Now I don't feel so beautiful.)
You walk to your apartment door,
your hands, your lips all over her...
At last, you're caught red handed.

If this is how you treat the comely,
I'd rather be the repulsive Medusa

2488,Emotion,RedPoemsTheThornOfTheRedRosePoembydeepthimallampalli,"There was something she thought again in his mysterious smile,
She tried to forget him but it was not possible even for a little while
She got out of her bed and walked around in the corridor
She was not ready to accept but her heart knew whom she was waiting for
It was in the royal banquet where she had met him the previous day
They unknowingly met in quiet an unexpected way
It was less than a moment they had noticed each other
He gave an adorable look and smiled as if he knew her
His eyes fluttered open all of a sudden at the thought of her
She was a perfect young maiden or she was royal rather
He leaned over his windowsill while a white dove came over his shoulder
“I’m almost addicted to her” he said with his clear blue eyes staring at her
The morning had begun with wide and sweet smiles
But was neither everlasting nor lasted for a long while
In his study room he was when the wild news came in
His marriage was fixed on Saturday in the Whackers Inn
The young man tried to persuade his father but, in vain
He only knew about the trouble he had due the love that gave him pain
The young girl came to know that her love would never be in her midst
She decided it was time for her last breath as she decided that she too might not exist
When he came to know that she was no more in his life
He killed himself to save the life of the unknown girl who wanted to be his wife
At the funeral everyone thought about the coincidence, which made all wonder
Why the bride and the groom died as the planned together"

2492,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsAdelaidaACubanCinderellaPoembyAnaMonnar,"Adelaida: A Cuban Cinderella
Written by Ana Monnar
{PAGE 1}
Once upon a time, on the island of Cuba lived two sisters named Adelaida and Marisol. Although identical twins in appearance, their personalities were as different as night and day. Adelaida was noble and loved to help others. She understood that the situation at home was not easy. Their father worked 14 hours a day and their mother was frail and very ill. So Adelaida would wake up very early every morning to cook breakfast and have it ready for her father before he’d go to work. They would eat together while they talked about many different matters.
{PAGE 2}
Adelaida would then prepare a tray for her mother; with love and tenderness she fed her each meal of the day. She also insisted on helping the nurse care for her much-loved mother. She spent time brushing her mami’s hair and would take pleasure in it.
{PAGE 3}
On the other hand, Marisol believed that the world revolved around her. After sleeping until noon, she expected a breakfast menu. From the moment that she stepped out of her bed, she would holler, “Adelaida, bring me my breakfast! ”
Adelaida would serve her sister bacon, eggs, toast, juice, and milk. She would hurry to take the plate to the table and cater to her sister. But Marisol always complained that the food was not hot enough, or the drinks not cold enough. No matter how much Adelaida would try to please her, it never seemed to be enough. Marisol often wanted favors during the very moment that her sister was caring for their mother, and so Adelaida would ignore her sister’s whining and tend to her mother first.
{PAGE 4}
During the long hours of each day Adelaida would sweep the floor, wash, iron, and do the dishes. In between chores, she would hurry each time Marisol rang a bell demanding her services. Marisol would command, “Curl my hair! ” “Wash and iron my clothes! ” “Make my bed! ” “I’m hungry! ” “I want chicken and yellow rice, salad, and custard for dinner! ”
Adelaida would just give in to her sister’s demands to avoid confrontations that would disturb their mother’s peace. Luckily Adelaida had dogs, cats, and birds that adored her and followed her around. Even the mice would come to keep her company and help out. Little Maria the mouse carried the napkin on top of her head to set the table. Sometimes Adelaida and her critters would have fun together carving a giant pumpkin to make pumpkin soup, pumpkin pie, and pumpkin custard.
{PAGE 5}
One evening when their father came home from work he called both of his daughters. Adelaida and Marisol both kissed him and listened to what he had to say. With a frown, he mumbled, “My boss is having a dinner at his mansion and he wants our family to attend. Mr. Perez wishes to reward me for being the employee of the year. He also is very proud of his son who just finished his internship and graduated as a doctor. He is coming home just in time for the Christmas holidays and he would like for us to meet him.' In his mind he was thinking, ‘How am I going to get my wife to go? She is so weak and frail.’
{Page 6}
Adelaida, who felt and shared her father’s concern and sorrow, read his mind and replied, “Papi, you go ahead and enjoy the party and take Marisol with you. I will stay home with Mami and I promise to call the nurse if I need the extra help.”
Marisol leaped and yelped, “It sounds like a great plan to me! Take me shopping for a new dress, shoes, purse, and jewelry.” Deep in her mind she was scheming to snatch the young doctor. If she married rich she could have servants, a chef, and a chauffeur.
Their father tried to coax Adelaida into going with them. He said, “Adelaida, please come along with us and I will call the nurse to care for your mother during the few hours that we will be gone.” Adelaida gently but firmly begged her dad to let her stay. He finally agreed.
{Page 7}
The dinner was only two weeks away and Marisol continued nagging about a dress, pair of shoes, purse, jewelry, and now even added perfume to her inventory. Finally, even after working 14-hour shifts, Papi took Marisol out on several occasions to buy her luxuries. If Adelaida, their mother, or the nurse tried to reason with her insistent demands, Marisol would weep and whine until she got her way. Their father looked fatigued and could barely keep his feet firmly on the ground. Adelaida hugged her father and whispered, “Papi, I love you.” He cracked a slight grin and kissed her on the top of her head.
{Page 8}
Adelaida felt sorry for her father and hoped her sister would grow up and mature someday. They were both 23 years old and even though they were twins, their actions and values were poles apart. Adelaida often proved to be as wise as an owl perched up high in a tree as the moon glistened and sparkled above.
{Page 9}
Finally the day of the invitation arrived and Marisol was ecstatic. This would be her big break for securing her future husband! She just wanted to get away from their home, which reeked of medicines, antiseptic, and illness. Adelaida helped Marisol into her gown, but instead of showing gratitude, Marisol's whimpering continued. Marisol applied globs of make-up. If someone were to wet a couple of fingers and roll them against her foundation, rouge, and eye shadow, they would have enough watercolors to cover a canvas with frolicking ocean waves. When she put on her big gold hoop earrings and dabbed on cologne, Marisol was thrilled by the look and smell created by these finishing touches.
{Page 10}
Marisol scurried to her mother’s room and waved good-bye from the door. The nurse could have been knocked over by a feather after observing such selfishness from Marisol. She pondered how one sister could be so kind, loving, and gentle, while the other was egotistical and self-centered. The nurse had been coming to the house for weeks, having been hired when the mother began to feel weaker and was confined to bed. She was a dutiful and observant nurse who continuously nourished those who needed her help. When the nurse went home for the evening, Adelaida would sit by her mother and hold her hand as she sang to her. Her soothing voice would help her mother fall asleep.
{Page 11}
Adelaida’s father kissed his wife’s forehead and then thanked Adelaida for being so caring and devoted. Marisol yelled from across the corridor, “Papi, hurry up or we’ll be late! ” Although he loved both his daughters equally and played no favorites, he could clearly see the difference in their behaviors.
{Page 12}
Marisol and her father arrived at the mansion. The butler greeted them and announced their appearance. Mr. Garcia’s gentle boss, wife, and son welcomed them. Mr. and Mrs. Perez inquired about the whereabouts of his wife and his other twin daughter. The humble Mr. Garcia replied softly with sad and shameful eyes, “My wife is ill, weak, frail, and bedridden so my other daughter Adelaida stayed home caring for her. She insisted that we come and have an evening out.” Young Dr. Perez did not even glance at Marisol. He just thought it odd that one sister was out partying, while the other was looking after her mother. Mr. and Mrs. Perez felt sorry for the family’s suffering and offered to take the meal to the Garcias’ home and eat there instead. Marisol was flabbergasted! ‘This can’t be happening! I must be having a nightmare! ’ she thought.
{Page 13}
Both families drove to the Garcia residence. The servants and chauffeur carried the meal inside. The Perez family members were guided to the master bedroom where Adelaida was brushing her mother’s hair as she sang so sweetly. Although Adelaida had no make-up and was wearing simple clothes, she looked cool, calm, collected, and as faithful as a saint. Young Dr. Perez looked at Adelaida’s emerald-green eyes and realized that this was one young lady that he would love to befriend. At the end of the corridor Marisol’s green eyes displayed her jealousy and envy.
They sat down around the ill Mrs. Garcia, spoke softly, and ate holding their plates with one hand and their forks with the other. They ate black beans, rice, pork, and fried plantains. Adelaida did not begin eating until she slowly and gently fed her mother first. By this point Marisol was starving, so she devoured her food.
After this very enlightening visit, the young doctor asked Mr. Garcia if he could come regularly to check up on Mrs. Garcia and visit Adelaida. Mr. Garcia was very grateful for his interest and agreed.
{Page 14}
The next day the young doctor appeared at the Garcias’ home. He read the chart with the diagnosis of the illness and then examined Mrs. Garcia. Dr. Perez wrote a prescription for a medication that had been tested and approved in the United States, but was not yet that well known in Cuba. He asked the twin young ladies to go to the pharmacy. Adelaida without hesitation obeyed and was ready to walk a mile and a half to buy the medication. Marisol, however, refused to go with the excuse that she was too tired. She thought that if she stayed while Adelaida was absent, perhaps the doctor would notice her instead.
As Adelaida walked the distance, she took joy in observing the squirrels climb the trees. In the meantime, Marisol, without any concern for her mother, just batted her eyes at the doctor and continued her selfish ways.
Each day Dr. Perez would come to check on their mother. It was very clear that he had compassion for the poor suffering woman. He also fell in love with Adelaida and her good deeds.
Marisol tried every trick in the book to split them up. But the more she tried, the more love bonded her twin sister with her new-found love.
{Page 15}
The nurse, an observant witness to Marisol’s selfish actions, was astounded. She waited until the doctor left one day and led the twins to the garden. She did not wish to upset the lady of the house.
As all three stood outside, the nurse said in a very sweet voice, “You, Adelaida, are sincere, kind, loyal, and nurturing, and for that I will grant that every time you speak, good things will come out of your mouth! ”
Then the nurse turned to Marisol and with a harsh tone of voice said, 'You, Marisol, are so selfish, self-centered, mean, and manipulating that each time you open your mouth to speak, only bad things will come out! ”
Adelaida quietly pleaded, “Please don’t hurt my sister, she is just immature and will one day change.” When pearls, rubies, and diamonds suddenly came out of Adelaida's mouth, Marisol was amazed and looked frightened but thought, ‘I wonder, what if I speak and get riches also.’ So she dared say, “Now what sort of bad things could really happen? ”
A snake slithered out of her mouth and she looked petrified. Marisol, without thinking, squealed, “Stop it! ” Before she even finished speaking, a crocodile dashed out of her mouth. Adelaida, being a kind soul, begged the magical nurse to forgive her sister. She cried, “Please take my riches away each time I speak, and remove the curse from my sister’s tongue, ” while more jewels spilled from her mouth and onto the floor.
For the first time, Marisol was enlightened by her sister’s love for her. Deeply touched, Marisol felt sincere remorse. The nurse could sense both sisters’ love for each other, and love conquered evil. The spell was broken, ending after 23 minutes had elapsed. One minute for each year of their lives,23 minutes that seemed like an eternity.
When their father returned that evening, he saw that both sisters were waiting hand and foot on their mother.
{Page 16}
The young doctor returned each day and their mother grew stronger and healthier. Once her health improved miraculously, he continued visiting Adelaida every single day. He asked her parents for her hand in marriage and they were pleased. His parents were very happy for their son and blessed him for choosing such a nice and noble girl.
The next day he surprised Adelaida by knocking at her door. On her front lawn was the most elegant elephant. The circus was in town and young Dr. Perez hired the ringmaster to assist with the elephant as a unique surprise.Riding it was the cutest mouse holding a sparkling diamond ring. Adelaida was in awe as she accepted his proposal. This time around both sisters’ emerald-green eyes shimmered. Marisol was very happy for her sister and gave her a big hug full of love.
{Page 17}
The wedding took place in Varadero Beach under the sunset. Only the immediate family attended. But off in the distance the magical nurse observed the scene and smiled. She knew that the Garcia family would not need her services anymore and it was time to move on to help another family.
The seagulls glided and flew in sweet harmony as the breeze broke the waves along the shoreline. The young doctor and Adelaida decided to make their home in Havana, Cuba, near their parents, where they lived happily ever after."

A body warm inside my arms.
A fantasy so alive, made of flesh and bone.
A voice of warmth, a scent of light.
The taste of sunshine and the sound of your sight.
Might just be enough to save my mind.
If only once again I can find.
Cinderella dressed in white.
Standing next to me tonight"
2494,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsMyCinderellaPoembyOkoronkwoJonathanJackson,"Gently into the bright future I sway;
Then I met her so fair on my way and
To her beauty a gaze I never say nay. For
In her I see the face of my Cinderella.
Her fairness no comparism, my confession-
Be of the damsel who in heart is full of passion. That
My desire of her I cannot hold back my emotion'
To call her my Cinderella.
The dance of her beauty leaves no measure.
Capturing my fantasy in great pleasure;
Forever with her be my time leisure
To always have a dance with her, my Cinderella.
Round in the shadowy whirl wind of fantasy;
Goes a great sense of me ecstasy-
With streams of passionate intimacy
To always behold her so pretty- my Cinderella.
Behold! Illusions now come to reality.
Imagination in great confidence calleth opportunity
Featuring the heart in that sense of utility'
Of having the one who shall be my Cinderella.
Shall I not look upon your beauty, that
Like a dance in the Milky Way
With heart full of appreciation of
Your majestic effervescence
Say… You are MY CINDERELLA."

to my mother and father for separate beautiful reasons -
feather-stitching these glass shadows
silent frame by frame
how could you help but wonder
later on
what all the shattering was for?
then you were telling us stories
in the dark green garden chair…
let it not be said
that is where the story ends…
Cinderella.  Cendrillon.
though it may not be magic-
you can't be blamed for
storms on a distant sun
am I the only one who sees
those
sunspots seeping through
the mystical rustling in the orchards-
where did they come from?
where did you?
here are the crystals, sequined- still-
in my lost hand- you may find missing
from your gown, your head, your heart
soft lemon afternoons like the ones in Renoir.
somehow, it all gets scattered in the dark
and you wonder where to stand
in a flickering brilliant language seldom used
except in a few newsreel half-projections
on the wall-the year in semi-review-
whose year was that?
it wasn't mine-
though it might be said
and surely was, that
music was her last diadem,
even when she fled
leaving all Enchantment behind her-
so they said-
and her bright skirts swirling
like the dream of Light itself
in a receding universe
and tearing her pale
raspberry satin hem-
it must have been that colour…
on every hazel twig in sight
barely above ground...
God lives in the remnants
so she smiles, opening her birthday gifts
of clocks that never chime;
putting in water the bunches of violets
that last and last...
you cannot fail to notice, even now,
that earliest sparkling is best and the
last to leave the party under the trees she says to
her crystal children on the breeze
the one with the paper lanterns
no longer living.
my darlings, don't get lost
beyond the pink glass frosted
fawn on the walnut what-not…
so we promised not to-
and to live on where rose curtains swayed
Cinderella.  Cendrillon…
shine out of sight, yourself, alone-
you'll know more than angels in
the end for you are good-
the best clue in all the kingdom
after a lifetime spent
rinsing out your pale peach
print again and again
hoping not to be found but just to be left
here dreaming…
and slipping the slipper carefully
into an apron of cloud…

Note to Reader:  It has come to my embarrassed attention that I
have pronounced the word 'Cendrillon' in an imaginary accent
but I am leaving it that way because I cannot hope to duplicate the
coincidental special effects in the video.  Does it help if I listen to Debussy and Ravel continually? I hope so..."
2496,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsCinderellaPoembyJamesMcLain,"How my mother treats me, sweeping out the golden straw.
Only can it tilt us and it's us it can when only,
deeply in the girls our clear feelings show the crimson heels.
Arrows point out the doubts of what has yet to come.
Mask of crimson, the pupils of her green the silver hair,
made up is fate, face is fair the which she burns it up.
Just as suddenly like the wind when he arrives with fans,
and as I climb up the carriage steps it tilts.
He moves away now it retracts and it then begins again.
Each movement of the hand and arm sweet violin.
I am shy the palace is a worm like my dark hole.
Where I was kept like sour wine it can't be slipped.
Pinks and yellows red the rose from back to front.
Chalice like my being climbs the wall of sweet lilacs.
Grace this state I shine and the coming stars and years,
I hope each revolution yet to come slides up as night
must bring me down to what I am and my guilt for what was done.
The sound draws near the sound it is I wish corrosiveness.
Two arms one second hand of the clock which never heard."
2497,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsCinderellaPoembyRobertWilliamService,"Cinderella in the street
In a ragged gown,
Sloven slippers on her feet,
Shames our tidy town;
Harsh her locks of ashen grey,
Vapour vague her stare,
By the curb this bitter day
Selling papers there.
Cinderella once was sweet,
Fine and lily fair,
Silver slippers on her feet,
Ribands in her hair;
Solid men besought her hand,
Tart was she as quince,
Living in a fairy land,
Waiting for a Prince.
Days went by and years went by,
Wistful wan was she;
Heedless of a mother's sigh,
Of a lover's plea;
On her lips a carol gay,
In her heart a dream -
Soon the Prince would come her way,
Gallant and agleam.
Then at last she learned the truth,
How her hope was vain;
Gone her beauty, gone her youth,
Leaving want and pain.
See! she's waiting all alone;
Hark! you hear her cry
Papers by the cold curb-stone,
Begging you to buy.
Winter winds are waxing chill,
Clouds rack overhead;
Cinderella will be ill,
Bye and bye be dead.
Yet she kept her vision clear,
To Romance was true,
Holding him forever dear
Whom she never knew.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
Cinderellas of to-day
Take no chance of loss;
When a good guy comes your way,
Nail him to the cross.
Let some ordinary cuss
Your coy heart convince;
Never miss the nuptial bus
Waiting for a Prince."

There is helping hands surrounded

Ever you will win never fail
You are the hope, you are genuine

I am not beautiful in every way

I am not a silent, graceful girl
I am exceptional
I have my disfigurements

I have a bread boy
I have a guardian spirit

2501,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsCinderellaLimericksPoembyPattiMasterman,"Cinderella was a good girl who went with the flow;
When the clock struck twelve, she knew she must go,
As she followed the good godmothers advice
And she never even had to think twice:
'Don't stay out after midnight, or you'll turn to a Ho.'
Cinderella got kissed by the prince;
There was magic involved, before the kiss:
A pumpkin became a coach
And a cigarette, a roach
And then this whiskey turned into piss."

those nice little mice
why is she so alone in it all
where is her fairy god mother
to say 'poof' and it all be gone
she needs a break
she needs for once to care for herself
when will she get to meet her prince
one that will sweeep her off her feet
will love her for who she is
she may not have to ugly step sisters
or a evil step mom
but she has an evil step dad
and distant mother
both with anger problems
i would call it even
she fights to calm her mind
as she dreams of the singing butterflies
she needs to escape
she needs to get away

she is packing up her pumpkin

good bye
farewell

with an evil grin
as she rides away
in her half broken pumpkin"

We only dance once
but last a lifetime
It was a magical time
Even thought we never saw each other face
But you remember how beautiful I dance
I know I left without saying goodbye
And I'm glad you've been looking for me since
Because one song bring two strangers together
And one dance make two stranger fall in love with each other
Baby You are my Cinderella
And I can tell you if we can find each other after all those years
And if one dance make us fall in love
We are going to live happily ever after
The truth is that it wasn't just a dance It  was
A Cinderella Dance"
2504,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsHowFairCinderellaDisposedOfHerShoePoembyGuyWetmoreCarryl,"The vainest girls in forty states
Were Gwendolyn and Gladys Gates;
They warbled slightly off the air,
Romantic German songs,
And each of them upon her hair
Employed the curling tongs,
And each with ardor most intense
Her buxom figure laced,
Until her wilful want of sense
Procured a woeful waist:
For bound to marry titled mates
Were Gwendolyn and Gladys Gates.
Yet, truth to tell, the swains were few
Of Gwendolyn (and Gladys, too).
So morning, afternoon, and night
Upon their sister they
Were wont to vent their selfish spite,
And in the rudest way:
For though her name was Leonore,
That's neither there nor here,
They called her Cinderella, for
The kitchen was her sphere,
Save when the hair she had to do
Of Gwendolyn (and Gladys, too).
Each night to dances and to fetes
Went Gwendolyn and Gladys Gates,
And Cinderella watched them go
In silks and satins clad:
A prince invited them, and so
They put on all they had!
But one fine night, as all alone
She watched the flames leap higher,
A small and stooping fairy crone
Stept nimbly from the fire.
Said she: 'The pride upon me grates
Of Gwendolyn and Gladys Gates.'
'I'll now,' she added, with a frown,
'Call Gwendolyn and Gladys down!'
And, ere your fingers you could snap,
There stood before the door
No paltry hired horse and trap,
Oh, no! - a coach and four!
And Cinderella, fitted out
Regardless of expense,
Made both her sisters look about
Like thirty-seven cents!
The prince, with one look at her gown,
Turned Gwendolyn and Gladys down!
Wall-flowers, when thus compared with her,
Both Gwendolyn and Gladys were.
The prince but gave them glances hard,
No gracious word he said;
He scratched their names from off his card,
And wrote hers down instead:
And where he would bestow his hand
He showed them in a trice
By handing her the kisses, and
To each of them an ice!
In sudden need of fire and fur
Both Gwendolyn and Gladys were.
At ten o'clock, in discontent,
Both Gwendolyn and Gladys went.
Their sister stayed till after two,
And, with a joy sincere,
The prince obtained her crystal shoe
By way of souvenir.
'Upon the bridal path,' he cried,
'We'll reign together! Since
I love you, you must be my bride!'
(He was no slouch, that prince!)
And into sudden languishment
Both Gwendolyn and Gladys went.
The Moral: All the girls on earth
Exaggerate their proper worth.
They think the very shoes they wear
Are worth the average millionaire;
Whereas few pairs in any town
Can be half-sold for half a crown!"
2505,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsCinderellaPoembyEdwardKofiLouis,"Am, amalgam!
With the ways of life;
Proof, roof!
With the ways of mankind;
Love!
Very sensible and very careful;
But, with the sweet muse of peace and joy.
Cinderella, real, dear, ear, read, deal, lead, led, lad, near, cine, line, den, era, dine;
Prove, rove!
Playing along in the garden of love to discover the sweet muse of peace.
Cover, discover!
With the muse of the joy in your heart;
And, into the forest of peace to rest your mind in the land of your muse.
Hoe, how!
To inspire and be inspired;
By the ways of peace and the ways of sweet love,
In the land of beautiful flowers whare joy reigns.
Love!
Quite safe with the laws;
Life!
Reluctantly agreeing to love;
And, for a better tomorrow in the land of peace."
2506,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsCinderellaOnTimePoembyMaryAngelaDouglas,"the clock will chime and you'll
remember what she said.
your dress will turn to sand;
your ribbands dissolving...
and criss-cross in the stars
you see your future, marred
and the diamond ships wavering.
it's time for walking home at
a fast pace leaving no trace
but you don't realize yet
(your heart is dazed)
one slipper still remains,
its own constellation
in plain view.
so drenched in evening dews
that even in rags, you'll
still sparkle,
vanishing from his sight;
oh, that you could take flight
from your own grieving;
singing, the world is sand
and the Hour glass, God;
forgetting a dream's
a bit opaque, at best.
but something at the gate's behest
gleams, try to understand... the rest!
says wait, oh wait, while from
the shimmering tree in the garden
slips mellifluously;
in gold array,
another day.

2507,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsCinderellaSyndromePoembyGenevievePilat,"Every girl has once fell victim
Of the Cinderella Syndrome
Where her dreams and fantasies wonder around
And have a tendency to roam.
She dreams of a life with a step-mother and sisters
Who treat her so cruel and mean
But then she’s saved by a magic Godmother
And becomes the most beautiful ever seen.
With a gown so beautiful and slippers of glass
She quickly heads out to the ball
And there she dreams the Prince will see her
And think she’s the fairest of all.
And then she’ll dream of dancing with the Prince
And be in treasured bliss
Knowing that their love will soon come true
Once they share that infamous kiss.
Yet midnight strikes and now the carriage
Is a pumpkin from the change
But she knows the ending of this fairytale
And knows her dream won’t rearrange.
But she does not have that glass slipper
To prove the shoe did fit
And her dream of ever being with the Prince
Is now only a counterfeit.
And yet young girls keep dreaming on
Without knowing the actuality
That glass slippers, and Princes and true loves
Will never be a reality."

And quite often heavy laden... as on and on life drags...
Yet despite her heart now broken... by others and their spite,
All her sighs were gently spoken... though she still prayed each night...
For sorrows had not crushed her soul... nor tempered female dreams...
Nor overcome her self-control... as others planned their schemes...
She scrubbed the floors, watched others smile... and took life in her stride...
As if she sought to pass each trial... with gratitude not pride...
For she was not the owner here... and that she knew full well...
The others made that crystal clear... what more was there to tell?
But Fate is known to intervene... to lend a helping hand...
Arranging things as yet unseen... with purposes still planned...
And so it was, one night love came... when she went to a ball...
The Prince's heart no more the same... she was his miracle...
When found at home, his heart was glad... his love he could not hide...
With Cinderella no more sad... the day she was his bride...

And I’m not gonna sit in a cold, dusty old attic,
Just Waiting and waiting for that someone to come and find me.
And then one day I realized,
The fariytale life just isnt the life for me.
I'm not that Cinderella.
I know that one day will be the day I'll find someone who loves me,
who needs me,
Who wants me for my heart and soul,
and not just a pretty face,
and he’s isn’t scared to show that he loves me.
A one who will see
that I’m pleased who I am,
I’m not that Cinderella.
I can chase my own Monsters,
Out of my room.
I Can dream my own dreams,
But maybe not accomplish them.
And my knight in shining armour,
Is upto me.

Not like the pretty girls you see in the story books,

2513,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsTaleOfWoeACinderellaStoryPoembysabinabista,"I would fade away if you pass me over
You’re making me walk through a broken glass
I ‘m getting more comprised in your love as the day passes
You’re not a fantasy, myth or an illusion
You’re the predicament of hopelessness in my story
The prologue starts off in a Cinderella story scene
With riots, masquerade, jamboree and parade
This was the dawn of love era in the century
As I marched your path at the time of misfortune
I got lost with no direction, no map and no one to mascot
The Cinderella scene seems to fade out in the darkness of catastrophe
All the pigments of bliss is no longer in the arena
You change it all for your egoism not knowing I was waning
Now I m standing in inertia with my hope failing
You’re forbidding me in every possible way
And abandoning me in the middle of nowhere
The situation so perilous is digging me into anesthesia
I m falling, failing, crying, stumbling but you never seem to care
This is not what was meant to be in the act
It’s an inevitable site where I m forced down
This insanity is just too factual to rely on
You could stab me or slay me into million pieces
The wind of agony is passing me over with constant might
But it’s not bothering me in anyway I m still standing in inertia
After a while I start to comprehend what the reality is
Promises are always made to be broken without justification
Tears don’t always make thing the way it should be
Cinderella story can end up without any prince charming showing up
Love always ends up with hurt, pain, misery and an unhappy ending
Pigments of bliss is just a faint beam in the darkness
And the most hurtful and agonizing fact is that
Goodbye is a word that is used to go away and it really is forever"

she was flying in a flying saucer
Looking the universe in curiosity
Striking the events of universe
From star to star she tried to reach
The flying saucer glittered in nights
That I saw in my eyes
Cinderella looking the planets
The beautiful earth, mars and all
The life breath facility in saucer
Technology were so superior to man
She felt no thirst or hunger in journey
She was blessed with gods will
Beautiful cinderella always prayed
In journeys she remembered the humans
The fellow people who loved her
The affection of her beloved mother
The fairy made problems to her
The lovable prince's charm she thought
The well ridden poems in human mind
Cinderella can read the minds prettily
Just like human computers in action
The stars, moons of different types
Different worlds, different live systems
Poor cinderella became blessed one
She got a place near the planets
For ever she looks to the earth she came
She shined and glittered like jewels
Where there is no prince, or paupers
The world of contentment only there
Where material gain is not a concern
In fact cinderella is a great enlightened
The nobility of a great human being
And an Angel's beauty and clarity in her
The flying saucer ever ready to carry
Cinderella the beautiful girl ever ready
To go from planets to planets and stars
Above oceans, mountains, and hillocks
To proclaim the noble feelings of love
The essential teachings of love she carries
The flying saucer superior to all
The loving mind ever superior to all

2516,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsCourageousCinderellaPoembyBhargabiDeiMahakul,"Once upon a time there was a daughter,
In family of merchant she was in laughter.
The time came she lost her both parents,
Thirteen brothers left one sister tenants.
All brothers were happy with sister-in-laws,
Family fell in maintenance of their clause.
Brothers were affectionate towards sister,
Love was unbending and love was their factor.
One day brothers went for business far place,
Sister played with friends to win life's race.
Sister-in-laws planned and tortured her more,
In absence of brothers she cried from her core.
Brother's wives sent her to forest with goats,
On grazing one was missed she fell in notes.
She cried in deep forest due to tiger lion fear,
Forgetting in path in pain she searched in cheer.
Soon she surrendered before supreme God,
In God's feet she poured devotion and did nod.
Fear went away; obstacles broke at a moment,
With courage moving in forest got goat comment.
Prayed God to forgive them to her sister-in-laws,
She urged God to free all from illusion's claws.
Victory of Cinderella, daughter of dead merchant
Even today people sing Gog's glory, verses chant."

we are the queen of nooks and crannies,
she sparkled, pulling a raisin bun from the air
with pink frosting on it?
you have to come prepared, she said
then a can of pink frosting appeared
on a lower shelf with a butter knife
I never saw before in my life.
and we had tea, deliciously who cares
what anyone else thinks.
plenty to drink of cherry fizz
or raspberry glitz or anything else
if you think of it, chilled, on chipped ice;
be nice and don't dawdle.
but dawdling is what the day is for
we both agree when it's green outdoors;
an April green and a wind that blows
and we are the very rose that blows

To wake her up from slumber.
With head weighing like a ton,
She awaited for the thunder.

Cleared her face, as slept near hearth.
Prepared she for yet another blow,
Calmness and patience she taught
And everyone called her Cinderella."
2519,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsCinderellaPoembyGAkanjiOlaniyi,"I used to think that beauty is for the roses
I used to think that elegance is for the gazelle
Now I discovered that Cinderella is beauty
Now I discovered that Cinderella is elegance
I have seen humility with great height
I have met respect with enormous length
But take it from me; Cinderella is the peak of humility
Yes! Believe me, Cinderella is the end of respect.
I am surely not sinking behind
Neither am I standing by myself
This is not a daydreaming
Certainly, it is not fantasizing
Cinderella, how graceful with your pose
Cinderella, how beautiful with your beauty
Cinderella, how elegant with your steps
Cinderella, how queenly with your look
Cinderella, though black and shining
Is the light in the darkness?
Cinderella, though living and bubbling
Is the dream of any man?
You are the world's greatest, Cinderella
You are like living in the fairly tales
Someone very rare to come by
Only just with a stroke of luck
You beat my imaginations, Cinderella
You confound my expectations, Cinderella
You are a dream come true, Cinderella
Your foot fits the lost shoe, Cinderella"

Chased by the devils

Demons made there traps

Wandering for well being

Warning to safety ways she cares

Cinderella a sign of hardship
Cinderella a victim always
Still triumphed on her love
Faced the life challenges
And got married to the prince."

even when he called her perfect

to take her place.
He was the prince charming

He would give her a look
followed by a gentle smile,
then a kiss.
He loved her
no matter how much she doubted him.
He knew they would be together forever."

A woman of brave and questioning mind
Stood for education and empowerment
Never brawled but a bravura in actions.
Cinderella had grown to woman hood
Facing all challenges to the girls
Still faced them in her style of brave
No one had courage to face her challenges.
She was not a bravado someone suspected
She was a hero in circumstances warranted
A valiant girl fought for justice
Never she minded the cowards opposing progress."

Can the loneliness her happiness kill?
She has a friend to talk to?

Yes, she should be happy,
she must be happy,
for I have provided her the best life a girl can possibly have,

until that night at your place
dollar store votive candles
boxed wine

Mom always told me about
how many

and I had to land you
the cheap

Mom also said it's just
as easy to fall in

dull and dusty

So I dream of

And watch shadows fade into faint silhouettes
The smell of melted pink candles filled the air
As she sat beside Zeus in His mighty chair
The burning cold air caressed her long, black hair
Unraveling a night so mysteriously fair
As she takes a last sip from her iced champagne
She felt the forsaken blood run through her vein
Foolishly struggling and trying to keep sane
From all the anxiousness it cannot contain
She will try to set her tainted spirit free
She will try to find the secret garden's key
And sail briskly amidst the Aegean sea
Though trapped within William Shakespeare's tragedy

2531,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsWhyMustntCinderellaDanceAgainPoembyNuzhatFatima,"Spring it is! Bouncy and crisp.
Sunshine, cheerful and sparkling.
The almond blossoms, as pretty as pink,
Why mustn't Cinderella dance again!
Out of bed from one more winter,
Her bosom rises to the sinless breeze.
Pensive yet lavish like a dream,
A born Eden, she fancies one more ball.
The tales of oppression are no fable
Her rags are real and sorrow acute.
Beset with a curse, dyed in her own blood
Every spring, she wakens to live some more.
It is time! Tulips bejewel her emerald frock,
And the falls frame glass slippers on her feet.
A snug shikara is her golden carriage,
And the depths of the Lake, her loyal coachmen.
Ah! She dances like she has never danced before
For, who knows, how distant the next spring is!
Her summers are timid and autumns cold
Thus, she dances like she has never danced before.
Her moves in meadows, firm and tireless,
Cinderella waltzes like a Queen of resilience.
Her pace through Boulevard, smooth and sensuous,
Cinderella swans like a native enchantress.
Every spring, she readies for the ball
Every spring, she loses a glass slipper.
No Prince has come in search yet,
No vows of peace and passion held.
Thence, in her fields and on her streets,
Beside the tulips and by the Lake,
Like a Tsarina of a charmed kingdom,
This spring, why mustn't Cinderella dance again!"
2532,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsOdeToCinderellaPoembySwarnapaliLiyanage,"In the glaring sun on the melting sand
She  marches from near by souk
Pushing a shopping cart to noble palace
Where she slaves for the day and night
As usual pulling air into empty lungs
Agape mouthed open eyed
At a hot summer noon
Nightmares of life 'Cinderella' dreams
She gifts fake legs to loving soul mate
Lost his legs in a minefield
Delays father's death swallowing by a cancer
She dives into the sea in search of elixir
Lights lavender candles on mother's tomb
Before she bore in mind died in a flood
Sends three brothers back school again
She wants to give them what she missed in life
Smiles like a heroine murmurs to herself
Wiping sweat off 'Cinderella' sighs
Whole three years she saved a bit
Flies soon back to her homeland
No wonder everybody in her village
Gather round to listen her adventures
Of the magic land where she lived
She remembers all 'Cinderella' witnesses
With a one pat of the magic wand
A mountain of money creates from oil
All rights of humans vanish in a minute
Generosity, kindness change to sandstorm
For a slight mishap downpour of abuses
Colourful apparels raise from heaven
Mock at her peeping into her wallet
Skyscrapers make necks ache
Glittering wealth makes eyes blurred
Cars as arrows pass blasting honks
Carrying princesses of her same age
All these to her just another mirage
'Cinderella' giggles
From far she sees ' Lady' at the gate
Shining shela and abaya in black
Wiping tears off she speeds up
Ten metres per second
'Cinderella' awakes
souk = Arab bazaar
shela =  a kind of scarf Arab ladies cover their heads
abaya = a kind of knee lengthed  black robe Arab ladies wear over casual dress
(Note: I wrote this poem as a tribute to underprivileged young maids who work in rich Arab countries sacrificing their  youthfulness to support  families in their homelands.)"

And dance in the silver moonlight
You could hold me tight and spin me in the air
If my name was Cinderella
If my name was Cinderella
You could pick me up
In your gold and diamond carriage
You could be the hero of this fairytale
And I could be the one
If my name was Cinderella
But I can’t breathe, whenever you’re with me.
Can you feel my heartbeat in my chest
It’s getting faster every second
Time slows down,  you are better than the best
But would you feel the same
If my name was Cinderella

I’m not Cinderella
Then you show me with a kiss

The village grown
Neither fairy nor devilish
Only a village girl
An innocent human girl.
Cinderella a serious student
Tried hard to achieve goals
To make herself to become a hero
In studies, sports, and arts
In singing her sound so melancholy
Our cinderella never failed.
Cinderella the girl pubescent
The mother told to neighbors
The women loved her very much
The beauty queen of the village
Cinderella never prided herself.
A humble and lovable human being
Cinderella helped the people
To make the illiterate literate
The inhuman  as a human being
Tried her best for welfare measures.
Still people cursed each other
Still people quarreled themselves
Tried to harm others feelings
Poor cinderella failed her attempts.
Then came a marriage proposal
The beauty of cinderella spread around
The prince came in picture
The devil made to block the proposal
But the prince adamant and decides
To marry the poor cinderella the humble.
She enjoyed the life with humility
Never boasted for her wealth or husband
Tried her best to do services
Liked the people rich or poor no matter.
A successful journey of life she followed."
2535,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsNoCinderellaSlipperPoembyLawrenceSPertillar,"Wrongs to commit them.
Are wrongs to commit. Period!
And there is no Cinderella slipper,
Going to fit the magnitude of that foot.
No matter who attempts to push,
That agenda.
In the hope the misdeeds done,
Will minimize the size of what has happened.
To depict the doer,
As a victim of mistaken identity.
Maybe in another fairytale to tell.
And that slipper is replaced,
With a distribution of medication...
To erase all misdeeds,
Witnessed to have taken place.
Deluding a sunken boat rises to the surface.
With no one to remember,
The many moons and midnights to pass.
Hoping to convince what is observed,
Rising to float upon the surface...
Is nothing more,
Than an innocent empty pumpkin.
To have been accused for horrendous activities.
And...
Leaving this deception,
Bought and sold.
By those on the highest of 'highs',
The telling to accept lies will get them!"
2536,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsMyCinderellaPoembyColeTroyer,"We used to love, we used to dance.
But something happened to make the love vanish.
The dance ended as my Cinderella left me, slipping through my hands like the sands of time.
Now I'm hiding all my pain as I wonder if she's doing the same. Everyone asks if I'm fine, and that I'll move on someday, and I know this is true, but for now, I want my Cinderella back.
It hurts to think about it, no matter what I do, the dreams of the past haunt me.The laughs, smiles, hugs, dates, and kisses. They all won't leave me alone, as I keep wanting her back, nights of restless sleep for a few weeks.
I act like I'm fie, but in reality, I just want her to give me one more chance, perhaps a dance. We would dance slowly, just like before, and I would smile, because I would have my Cinderella back."

In the little street of the town
In shabby dressed, the girl seen
In speedy steps she was walking
But somewhere in fear she seemed
The time was evening nearing dark
The night was slowly taking place
The girl was in busy walk in street
The girl is beyond the reach of eye
Where I mistaken for cinderella the girl."
2539,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsCinderellaPoembyRusselTanner,"Cinderella was quite a nice girl, at the start
Then her mother passed away, which broke Daddy’s heart
But “Time heals all wounds”, and again he did marry
Of Daddy’s second wife, Cindy was wary.
For the woman was vain, most jealous and proud
“I’ll make this girl suffer! ” the old hag vowed
She and her two daughters, whenever Dad was away
Made Cin sleep in the cellar – that was on a good day!
Came a time when the heir to the throne (the prince)
Sent out invites to a ball (though at some girls he did wince)
For the ball was intended to find his fair bride
Kind, caring, princessy and not stuffed with pride
Cinder’s stepsisters were ooh! so very excited
She’d never seen them more distracted, disguised and delighted
All week, in Dad’s absence, she slaved to prepare
Scrubbed their dresses, ironed scarves and dreadlocked their hair
On the night of the ball Cinders eagerly did say
“So what do you think? Purple? Light grey? ”
“But you’re not going! Her stepmother cried from chambers within
And dragged to the cellar, Cindy’s stepsissies shoved her in
Off they went to the ball in a Ferrari F5
Leaving Cin alone in the cellar to scream, rant and rave
Just as she, in her anger, was about  to hurl a chair
“Do put that down, dear” a fairy said  and appeared from thin air
“Oh god-ma, do you really think you could? ”
She could and she did, with the warning she would
Have to be back by midnight, that’s all, off you go!
In no time at all a Merc dropped her off, “Oh! Thanks, Bozo! ”
Well, what a shock she got when she stepped in to the ballroom
She cried” I don’t want HIM to be my bridegroom! ”
For the prince was not tall, dashing, dot dot dot
On the contrary, he was speckled with spots and quite short
Cindy had a perfectly horrible night
Once home, she pleaded with all of her might
“Oh god-ma, I’ve learned a jolly good lesson”,
“D’ya think you could find me a nice man…like your grandson? ”
In no time, Cindy and god-ma’s grandson were wed
He was a kind boy, caring and very well-bred
And the prince? He  still scours the whole kingdom for feet
To match a glass slipper what Cindy lost at the palace in her hurried retreat."
2540,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsCinderellaRenewedPoembyMyraAhmad,"there was once a girl I knew
Her name was Cinderella
But Cinderella is way too long
We'll call her just Ella
Ella was a spoilt kid
Oh yes, she was
She rather barks than talks
not someone to cross
Then Gloomy air Spread everywhere
As her mother died with heart attack
All relatives cried at the news
Ella also did, but it was fake
His father married again
The lady had daughters of her own
Beautiful they were, oh yes
Names: Isabella and Sharon
Our Cinderella was very jealous
girls had taken her place, not one but two
Ella wanted to take revenge
From the girls, and their mother too!
But before she could do anything
The handsome prince called a ball
All the maidens were invited
It was to take place in the castle's hall
Excitement arose everywhere
Beautiful looked our Cinderella
But her stepsisters were their too
And their was no match for Isabella
The prince walked in the room
His eyes fell on Isabella
He asked her for a dance
And not our Cinderella
Soon the news spread through the kingdom
Prince and Isabella were to marry, no pretend
But then something happened
The prince chose Cinderella instead!
on the marriage day, bells rang
Ella and prince were coupled
But prince looked so forlorn and sad
As though he had just been crumpled
And as the carriage went, people wondered
What was it, that had dejected him
But we know the truth, that
Cinderella had a revolver to torture him!"
2541,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsTheCinderellaShoePoembyHerbertNehrlich,"There was a letter in the mail,
I dreamed that night about
a woman named Tara McHale.
Although there were those lips that pout,
it was the presence of  a breeze
made up of warmth and intellect,
she stopped for just a minute, just to tease
yet it was futile and I was not able to detect
more than the pheromones of something great,
of youth and fresh  aroma, passing through,
of silent whispers knitting silk for a debate
she left behind for me her cinderella shoe."
2542,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsCinderellaBellaPoembyBridgidPatrick,"My outstretched arms surpass the point
Of normal, taxing every joint
By reaching, gasping, pulling in
The cloistered thoughts that lie within.
We meet in quiet, swathed in night,
Our bodies bathed in candlelight,
As words are whispered, sparsely spread
Between the bureau and the bed,
Where, skin-on-soul, our friction roars
While each of us, in turn, explores—
The vastness shuts—a shrink-wrapped world
Containing two, enclosed and curled
Together in contented bliss,
A rhythm set, no breath amiss
Within the syncopated shell
Of our imagined wishing well,
Which shimmers not with silver coins,
But softly gleams, as love enjoins,
With eyes awash in dancing hues,
A flashing mesh of browns and blues.
Our funneled gazes turn the lock
On earthly cares, to catch the clock—
11: 59—pre-chime,
Before it strikes our ending time—
Instead, we claim the lives we know,
The challenges, the chores, although
One day, with limitations gone,
Perhaps our dream will sidle on
Beyond the Cinderella toll,
Where, unencumbered, we could roll
Towards a truth, on steady wheels,
Of freer time, and new ideals."
2543,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsCinderellaDreamingPoembyFrederickKesner,"The birthing of articulated expression
will always find its means of entering
into the world outside and beyond
the inner recesses of our awareness.
I love the wee and trippy hours of the
after midnight when the glass slipper
lay glimmering aloof in the moonlight
and the weary dreamer sets some
ink of thoughts onto the parchment
of a woozy head - too early in the day
to be about one's inescapable routines
too late in the night to do but dream
This is the witching hour in a life
where most everything is transfixed
in the baffling clarity of cerebration
the muses dancing in glad celebration"

Cinderella the luckier one
Saved from the wicked ones
Got one the great prince
The prince himself charming
The prince himself good looking
Ever pride to the dignified girl
Cinderella the young girl
From curse to blessing she became."
2545,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsTarantellaForCinderellaParodyHilaireBellocTarantellaPoembyJonathanROBIN,"Do you remember the Ball, Cinderella, do you recall the Ball?
And the prancing, glancing, dancing
of blissed eyes Do you remember the Ball, Cinderella, do you recall the Ball?
And the prancing, glancing, dancing
of blissed eyes Chance kissed romancing;
and the breeeze teasing sneeze when I fell to my knees with a bawl,
winter freezing causing wheezing,  seizing me just when advancing,
causing you to forestall!
shining goblets fine wine full, lining guzzling gullets, free for all,
the vicious suspicious looks of ambitious
matrons with delicious daughters on call!
supercallifragilisticexpialidocious withal!
Do you remember the Ball, Cinderella, do you recall the free-for-all brawl?
Then the clock that twelve struck when luck ran amuck
when the slipper slipped ‘mid many
that it didn’t fit, - not any, neither Terri, Tonie, Jenny, -
And the hammering on the doors and the din?
And the hip! hop! hap! of the clap
of the reins on the rump on the pump-
kin’s horses clancing, prancing, fading hooves distancing.
Waiting not, with forceful trot they went, with wings lent,
and tlic! tloc! knock echoed far...
Do you remember the Ball, Cinderella, do you recall the Ball?
Never more, Cinderella, what a bore!  Only the fairy foresaw
the slipper left standing at the door.  No trace! – none at all,
in the walls of the Hall where falls the face
of the Prince rincing eyes, for the foot-falls
echo like the boom of doom in an empty room
while the footman horsing around with the kitchen maid
made merry with the sherry on the fly which wasn't very
prim and proper till p'lice copper came and played
on his whistle calling order be obeyed
with his siren shrilling, silver badge displayed.
In this New Year now I'm chasing shadows everywhere retracing
Cinderella's steps my heart can't bear replacing,
pacing here and there and up and down unlacing
treasured slipper pleasure's promise acts as casing,
spacing out without her footloose pulse a-racing,
only pain remains it seems, vain dreams embracing..."
2546,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsLucyInCinderellaPoembyKumarmaniMahakul,"Once some children
Said to Grandmother,
""Please tell us a story
We are in wait no bother.""
Grandmother with a smile
In her rosy lip,
Began to tell a fairy tale
She sat on a chair hip.
She said about Cinderella
Whom people do ignore,
""Here is a story of orphan girl
She never feels bore.""
Her name was Lucy
She had four brothers,
She had moral qualities
She was helping to others.
The brothers went on
A long journey for trade,
The wives ordered Lucy
To went with goats to glade.
There Lucy made the goats
Grazing, she was about to ruin,
A prince came near her
And he made her queen.
They took farewell from sisters-in laws
And they came back to kingdom,
There with all Lucy lived happily
She did get more freedom.
Lucy was moral in character
She was praying God,
God helps those creatures
Who pray him and nod.
Prince recognized the quality
And inner beauty of her,
Here Cinderella vanished
And they lived like Zur."

I ran from home.
My father was cruel,
He treated me like,
A simple slave child.
I ran to a friends,
Trying to leave town.
We almost escaped,
Then he saw us,
He took me straight home.
Once we arrived,
I packed all my things.
As he begged me to stay,
He said something was wrong,
He wasn't sure what.
He went to the phone,
I ran out the back.
To my friends once more,
The cops have soon come,
They said, 'we can do not'.
So know here I am,
A run away girl.
No more treated as if,
I am Cinderella,
Without a kind prince.
But a prince I need not,
For I have many friends.
With many a true,
I hold them all close,
For I am Cinderella.
And one day I'll have my Prince."

At the stroke of midnight
Her lost slipper upon the stair
In the silver majestic moonlight
The fairytale turns to dust
As the witching hour begins
Down in the forgotten cellar
Her sorrow and pain she sings
So not to loose her memories of this night’s enchantment
She tearfully produces ink of thoughts onto peasant parchment
Recumbent but weary on her bed of mice invested hay
Crying her self to sleep still and alone Cinderella lay
The next morning prince charming comes round
With the clear glass slipper he had found
A gentleman he lowers down on one knee, while Cinderella sits
Drawing eloquent smiles as the slipper perfectly fits"
2551,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsACinderellaStoryVsRealityPoembylovitalara,"There is a girl and a boy,
Connected only in cyber,
Never met,
Never phoned,
How long can it last?
It is like in the movie ‘A Cinderella Story’,
Her friend said.
The girl loves him so much,
She cannot took her mind off him,
She waits in front of computer every night,
Waiting for her Prince Charming to greet.
They have known each other a year,
They lived very far apart,
It is like one is up there,
One is down the globe,
Can it last?
She wondered.
One day,
Her Prince Charming said those magical words to her,
She was barely able to breathe,
She was the happiest person on Earth,
But Prince Charming loves her as…?
On one beautiful night,
As usual,
She spent almost hours and hours in front of the computer,
Wait till Prince Charming to come,
But he did not,
She was a bit upset,
She wrote to Prince Charming,
‘You love me as what? ’
Prince Charming replied her the next day,
‘I love you as my girlfriend’,
‘Will you be mine? ’
For God’s sake,
She was absolutely wanted to be his,
‘I sure will’,
It was the best day of her life.
So, there it was,
For her,
She hopes her story does not end just like that,
She will wait for her Prince Charming,
To come to her,
In reality,
Not just in cyber,
Even if it take 100 years.
She wanted them to see,
She wanted him to take her hands,
She wanted to dance in the rain with him,
She wanted to feel his warm,
She wanted him for sure,
She will wait, she swore.
A Cinderella Story?
It is different with her story, she thought,
It is just the same,
When it comes to how they stay connected."

ever been fear of boring nothingness
I commiserated with the animals for
their confinement to the here and now

desperately seeking my own escape
through mind- power and ethereal

JOY –only I am bereft of that privilege
of joyful being through my allergy…
I’m so glad to know the goodness of
the universe, but my question is
why was I born without the ability

to discomfort and pain – why was
I left out of everything? And will

The fondness of love you gave
The unselfish gestures to guests
The great wishes of you
Ever it is pleasure to remember
Curses followed you but never minded
Attempts to destroy the future
Never minded, but always cried

You got your loved one the prince
The great achievement for your life
Cinderella the kindness in your heart
Love the children and the world
Humanity in your words always
Pleasantness in your feelings followed
Ignorance never minded
Attentive to the  people whom you care

Not as a victim but a successful heart."

Stood for service to fellow humans
Family woman stood with her
Rights issues took by Cinderella
Took the cases to courts of justice.
Organised the woman for empowerment
Education were her favorite theme
The little girl she persuaded to school
The Poor girls she gave books and bags
Cinderella the great girl of friendship
The neighbors respected ever in pride
She was a brave, had strong will power
Seldom shown mercy to the abusers.
Cinderella herself had a chosen carrier
The human psychology she graduated
Counselling made to the woman in village
Where she tried her best to raise the respect
That deserved the woman in public life."

That literature is a big deal
It is full of nonsense, 'tis true

That you can achieve your ends
In understanding literature and its aims
And knowing all its titles and great names
Some poets can be role models for us
Others' idoicy we can laugh at and discuss
We may learn from some historic events
And take the morals behind what is meant
Some plays can be a source of inspiration
For students' great works and innovation

Hopefully, nothing in it is at all wrong"

2558,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsCinderellaPoembyKumarmaniMahakul,"Cinderella means the personality or beauty of a person,
Or things remain unrecognized in real and in version.
In our society there are some talented and wise people,
Some of them come to the knowledge of nation in ample.
There are some extraordinary children in our society,
Who can dance, sing and play on music in variety
Of course mass media brings some to our eyes,
Till in remote area few lads are left in rise.
There are some medicinal plants till now unrecognized,
Animals cure themselves by using these plants recognized.
Society develops through the person with strong personality,
They must come to our eyes that have the perfect morality.
Let's try to find them and to vanish of Cinderella,
Make hay while the sun shines or keeps in rain an umbrella."

2563,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsMissCinderellaSingMySongPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"This is one of my poems in my current erotic poem book I am writing to publish later this year. And please it is all based on imagination!
The smell of her strong musky fragrance
Imposed on me a certain disturbance
Clearly in the air there was no romance
Perhaps that was a sign of its entrance
That night I slept but a little
My fingers in a constant fiddle
Tossing and turning
My imagination running
Wow! She was stunning
Her lips alone I couldn’t dismiss
Even with a single kiss
I simply do not know how to ‘take the piss’
Those delicate rosy cushy red lips
Needed seven times seven daily kiss trips
With special tantalizing nurturing from my lips
Her large beautiful breasts
Lay hidden beneath her blouse
She was not yet my spouse
Yet every part of me was aroused
I’ll like to grind my body upon her thighs
Feed her lips with laughter and moaning cries
Share intimacy with her below the midnight skies
Someday maybe together we may fly
Who knows how high if we try!
And when she spoke
Her words alone were electrifying
While I listened mesmerising
Memorising every word she spoke
Until my brain was literally soaked
I like to kiss her body inch by inch
Tease her with every flinch and with soft pinches
Touch and caress her smooth black ebony skin
Taste her breasts as our love manifest at a love nest
Pin her to the bedroom wall and make love to her gently
Talk to her beautiful body all night tenderly
Her juicy pie will get wetter than wet
So she will never forget the day we met
On a beautiful night of poetry
With women writers making history
Her thoughts were with another
At first I thought her poem
Was about her sister or her mother
Never guessed it was her ex-lover
It seems Miss Cinderella
Is still hanging on to what is gone
Miss Cinderella
Sometime, I’ll like to take you out for some fun
The wonderful night past
She vanished so fast
No phone calls, just occasion text and emails
Where have I failed, or have I failed
Before I even started to set sail?
I can’t call now, Life’s pressure is written on my wall
I’m not entitled to pleasure in my crystal ball
But it seems Miss Cinderella
Is still hanging on to what is gone
Miss Cinderella
Sometime, I’ll like to take you out for some fun
Take a walk with you under the sun
Massage your body beautifully as we take turns
Play hide and seek as we take shelter and run
I could bake you one of my delicate buns
Miss Cinderella
Stop hanging to what is gone
All that is past and done
My passion for you is about to be born
My feeling for you is better than none
I invite you to sing with me my song
There is this feeling I have
We cannot be wrong!

2564,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsCinderellaPoembyRandallJarrell,"Her imaginary playmate was a grown-up
In sea-coal satin. The flame-blue glances,
The wings gauzy as the membrane that the ashes
Draw over an old ember --as the mother
In a jug of cider-- were a comfort to her.
They sat by the fire and told each other stories.
""What men want..."" said the godmother softly--
How she went on it is hard for a man to say.
Their eyes, on their Father, were monumental marble.
Then they smiled like two old women, bussed each other,
Said, ""Gossip, gossip""; and, lapped in each other's looks,
Mirror for Mirror, drank a cup of tea.
Of cambric tea. But there is a reality
Under the good silk of the good sisters'
Good ball gowns. She knew... Hard-breasted, naked-eyed,
She pushed her silk feet into glass, and rose within
A gown of imaginary gauze. The shy prince drank
A toast to her in champagne from her slipper
And breathed, ""Bewitching!"" Breathed, ""I am bewitched!""
--She said to her godmother, ""Men!""
And, later, looking down to see her flesh
Look back up from under lace, the ashy gauze
And pulsing marble of a bridal veil,
She wished it all a widow's coal-black weeds.
A sullen wife and a reluctant mother,
She sat all day in silence by the fire.
Better, later, to stare past her sons' sons,
Her daughters' daughter, and tell stories to the fire.
But best, dead, damned, to rock forever
Beside Hell's fireside-- to see within the flames
The Heaven to whosee gold-gauzed door there comes
A little dark old woman, the God's Mother,
And cries, ""Come in, come in! My son's out now,
Out now, will be back soon, may be back never,
Who knows, eh? We know what they are--men, men!
But come, come in till then! Come in till then!"

I don't clean the fire place.
My name's not Cinderella
Now get out of my face!
I don't cook all the dinners
the breakfast, or the lunch
if I get in a fight, it's safe to assume
that I threw the first punch.

delight. As she slips into her ball gown, her

somewhere in between
the countryside and palace
that she'd never seen.
Walking through mud,
face streaked with tears
still clearly so beautiful,
the slippers were clear.
But soon she got covered
in the worst kinds of things
and she didn't understand
what marriage would mean.
She had no conception
of being the queen,
so she met a young beggar
and settled, for him.
They lived in a hovel
right outside town;
she'd watch the processions
of royals going down.
She often wondered
how it might feel
to sit on a throne
(it gave her a thrill!) .
As she tended the fire
and sat in the cinders
she would dream of a life
with riches unending.

That your Cinderella
Must leave no matter what
At midnight on the dot
For if she does not
Yours will not
Be a happy lot
Please turn around my love
Cast a glance at the
Beauty that abounds
In this lovely gathering
Of dolled up ladies waiting
To play the game of mating

Have you seen Cinderella tonight?
Was she ever real?
Lost in the mist
Of lies and deception,
Hidden in the shadows
Where she used to feel safe,
With the aid of a secret Godmother,
Her ghost tries to find the light.
And as the moon is chased by the sun
Magic is replaced by reality
And all again are plain
And ordinary
And lifeless.
Tomorrow night
Her withered spirit
Will try once more to find her prince.
She believes that dreams are
Our pathway to magic
And I am definite that
Fairy tales end only when
We allow them to."
2572,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsCinderellaPoembyvictoriafoister,"Amidst a darkened night
lay a dreadful sight,
inside a pumpkin;
she made her home.
Abandoned by her family
a stray in society.
She wears a torn, blue dress
her body- now straw
with stiches tearing apart her sides.
Once she was beautiful,
a prince would marry her any day.
But poor Cinder's never got the chance
Cinderella missed the dance.
Her fairy god mother was a deceiver
now only a rat would kiss her.
Her glass slippers full of cracks
her smile is cracked.
She missed the deadline as the clock struck ten.
Cinder's thought she had till twelve,
but the doors where closed, of the house she used to call home.
Her  eye's turned to buttons, all on their own
Cinderella had the pay the price.
So the fairy took her soul
she became a doll with a story- she was a so called fairy tale.
Used to wreak havoc on us humans and to manipulate our dreams.

Will you marry me the next day, saying that you found your one and true love?
Will you make me feel special, and shower me with love and support that any man should give to his women?
But, that won't happen.
Because I'm not Cinderella. I'm not Cinderella, because I won't have anyone that will love me enough to drive me in a golden carriage, or chase after me when I get to scared to commit to anyone.

Wearing the dress that I bought for the ball
It’s long and flowing, sparkling white
My tiara of diamonds shines in the light
At the bottom of the stairs you’re waiting for me
And I gracefully float down for all to see
You take my hand and touch my face
You’re the only one I notice in the expansive space
We’re now dancing in shadows of flickering light
Holding each other close, holding each other tight
You kiss my neck and then touch my face
Then kiss my lips in a loving embrace
Time stands still whilst we are together
Feels so good, it seems like forever
I look at the clock, that cannot be right
But the bells start to chime, confirming midnight
But there’s no need to leave
From the ball tonight
I’ll be with you my prince

2576,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsCinderellaAndTheDogPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"Cinderella and her dog
sat at home on the old log.
Sisters had gone to the dance
homely ones did have no chance.
Said the dog 'my Cinderella,
may I be this evening's fella,
we could wash and dress with care
and could make a handsome pair.'
She had raised her bushy brow,
asked the clever dog just how
they would get into the castle
while avoiding a big hassle.
'You are nothing but a mutt,
always scratching your big butt,
full of craziness and fleas
barely reach up to my knees.'
Dog had motives quite ulterior,
said 'I'm not at all inferior,
every dog, on the inside
hides a man beneath his hide.
All it needs is one French Kiss,
which in turn produces bliss,
makes me into your own prince
(turns away and quickly grins) ,
Bravely Cinderella acts,
knowing only half the facts.
Kisses him for one whole hour
to release that magic power.
But no miracle breaks free,
dog lifts leg now, just to pee,
doesn't seem the least surprised,
she has still not realised
that the dog has pulled her leg.
So she now begins to beg:
'I will kiss you one more time,
please come out, man in your prime.
Let me tell you that your breath
is far worse than Father Death.'
So, they kiss again and linger
as the Emperor's own singer
happens to be wand'ring by,
carrying a rhubarb pie.
'Sir', pleads pretty Cinderella,
you, the singer Pico Bella,
can you give us some advice? '
Pico says 'You have nice eyes,
but a mutt will stay a mutt,
into man a mutt cannot
metamorph through simple kissing,
since he has genetics missing.'
Well, she turned now to the critter,
hot, enraged and really bitter,
'How could  YOU,  a lowly dog
who sleeps in a hollow log
trick me into kissing French
with your halitosis stench? '
'Look', he answered, 'truly sorry,
first, I had to have a story,
all my life I've not been kissed,
but I am a journalist.
Hired by the King's own wife,
never gotten into strife.
Learned that one can grab a chance
if the lady likes to dance.'"

So no one else stand a chance"
2578,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsABrokenCinderellaPoembyPaulaGlynn,"Like a broken Cinderella,
She turns in the jewellery box,
There is no exit, no escape, no hope,
And she is hanging from a noose rope.
Broken Cinderella, broken Cinderella,
You're over; a broken record,
That cannot play, pain here to stay,
No prettiness to escape to,
No moving forward, only moving back,
Trapped, dead, deceased, over and broken,
With a torn dress, a torn gown,
That is ripped at the seams,
Ripped in her agony, she searches,
But can find no one with a solution.
Her shoes, long since worn out,
Leave her walking a lonely road,
Almost crawling on the ground,
Her heart an empty, cold stone,
With many heavy stones in the load.
She wishes for mercy from the hot sun,
She wished for mercy from the cold snow,
Where is the window? she asks,
Where is my future? A broken Cinderella,
Broken, down and out,
Living all by herself,
With no helping hand,
With no friend or stranger to understand.
And she yearns to be fixed,
She hopes to replace those bricks,
That will make her a new home,
A world where her heart carries no stone,
And leaves her to fly in the blue sky,
Her wings carrying her,
From the unforgiving ground."
2579,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsCynicalCinderellaPoembyAirdaJones,"So this is love?
Is this what they told me of?
Because I don't feel the connection
And where it is going, which direction
So this is what makes life worth while?
Has it always been this style?
How is it to fill the empty spaces
If I cannot even see its true faces
So this is love?
I don't feel that it is enough
Because my heart can't fly with wings
And my heart hasn't found the song its to sing
So this s the warmth of aglow?
Well, I don't think that I know
That Heaven is as divine
And I can tell that it will never be mine
So this...
Is the miracle that I've been dreaming of?
So this...
Is love? ..."

I need your crummy clothes cleaned.
First, make sure you have every stain off them.
You need to look decent tonight for the guests.

2582,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsAbusedCinderellaPoembyBellaRavenstar,"Cinderella was a nice gal
Always did what she was told
Put others before herself
Cinderella had lots of hopes and dreams
One day in the town she heard of the ball
CInderella wanted to go
Really really bad
Her step mom gave her touble
Her sisters were ok
But she never went
Beucase no one cared
Poor cinderella cried
Dreams really don't come true
Fairytales are fake
Cinderella never found her prince
She never really went to any ball
She lost all her hopes and dreams in life
Cinderella never got a granted wish
Poor cinderella
True love never found her
When she was old
Cinderella died an old maid
When Cinderella went to heaven
She was treated like a real princess
Angels planed a ball for her
And made her a pretty white gown
Jesus danced with her
Then he took her by the hand
And led her to her handsome chosen prince
It was all worth the shattered hopes
And dreams in life
To have a fairytale ending in heaven"
2583,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsIMNotCinderellaPoembyVivinSeprini,"This bell ring spread a beautiful memories
About a girl who tried to catch a little dream
Unfortunely she found herself in a middle of
Life that she couldn’t spend without perseverance
She now close her heart to anybody else
Then a charming prince come to lend a hand
To a poor little girl who couldn’t feel
Love or happiness she’s hard to believe in
I’m not Cinderella or any princess else
She said
I’m not live or wait for white horse mounts
I’m not want to love or be loved
That’s not a thing like I could hand on
Everyday till past I live in the heavy rain
And I don’t need you to give me a sunshine
I’m not cry or hurt at night
Don’t stand on your own mind! ! ! !
I’m not Cinderella or any princess else
Not that time or this time
Waiting for true love?
Don’t say a mess
But yes she used to dream as one
Wear a white dress with a man who stand
Right beside her
Carrying her hand
Then they kissed
Live happy ever after
But
I’m not Cinderella or any princess else
I will love without be loved
And only lost
To a beauty dream like you just appear
And if I give you my heart you will tear it apart
But
I’m not Cinderella or any princess else
No love story will tell in my midnight tale"

2585,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsCinderellaPoembyHenryLawson,"A lonely child with toil o’ertaxed,
Sits Cinderella by the fire;
Her limbs in weariness relaxed,
And in her eyes a sad desire.
But soon a wreath is on her brow;
A bonny prince has claimed her hand;
And she’s as proud and happy now
As any lady in the land.
Ah, then to see a fairy bright,
And to have granted what you would,
You only needed to do right,
You only needed to be good.
But this was in the days of old,
When man to wiser folk would bow;
And though you were as good as gold
You’d never see a fairy now.
And yet they must have managed well
If only half the tales are true,
The wondrous tales the writers tell
Of what the fairies used to do.
But now the world has grown so wise
It does without the fairies’ aid;
And who can find a prince that tries
The shoe upon a beggar maid?
It must have been a better time
When virtue always met its due,
And “wicked men who dealt in crime”
Were punished by the fairies, too.
But never more they’ll come again
To give the good what they desire;
And Cinderellas wait in vain,
And weep beside the kitchen fire."

What’s the matter with you?
Where is Prince Charming?
Who are looking for now?
How you could have done this?
The teardrops fall tonight
Lost without a care to fight
Blowing in the wind now
Are the dreams you left
Your hearts in you hands
Slipping away till falls
Shattered it to pieces
Trying to put it back
With what is left of you
Thinking is there anything else
That I could do now
I wished it all a way
Here I am sitting here
Looking at shooting stars
Getting lost as I am"
2587,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsCinderellaPoembyBarnabasJRamonFortune,"The clock strikes midnight
and the magic ends:
the fairy tale is over
and the truth offends.
The coronet, the necklace and the gown
and shawl of ermine trimmed with eider down
to tinsel and to ashen rags have turned;
only a slipper, left in haste
upon the stairway, overturned,
remains unchanged and fancy chaste.
The streets are all deserted, save for mice
scuttling for safety through a broken wall
as Cinderella draw her tattered shawl
around her shoulders'
but she feels at once that this will not suffice
to warm her body or to quell her beating heart
which is as cold as ice!
Back to the ashes of her fireplace
back to the dust from which she came
before her fairy touched her with her wand
and put a blush of beauty on her face,
changed all her drabness to magnificence,
set magic to her name
so that no longer could she be the same
she goes and crouches trembling in a corner!
Than she, what other soul could be forlorner!
O, frightened soul, my little Cinderella,
don't you remember that you left behind'
a slipper onto the stair?
You did not disappear
and leave no telltale sign to show
that you were really there:
the lovely maiden of the fairy tale!
Even now, the heavenly prince
is out in search of you,
your slipper in his hand,
to slip upon your foot
and take you back with him
to his own land!"
2588,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsCinderellaPoembyRoaldDahl,"I guess you think you know this story.
You don't. The real one's much more gory.
The phoney one, the one you know,
Was cooked up years and years ago,
And made to sound all soft and sappy
just to keep the children happy.
Mind you, they got the first bit right,
The bit where, in the dead of night,
The Ugly Sisters, jewels and all,
Departed for the Palace Ball,
While darling little Cinderella
Was locked up in a slimy cellar,
Where rats who wanted things to eat,
Began to nibble at her feet.
She bellowed 'Help!' and 'Let me out!
The Magic Fairy heard her shout.
Appearing in a blaze of light,
She said: 'My dear, are you all right?'
'All right?' cried Cindy .'Can't you see
'I feel as rotten as can be!'
She beat her fist against the wall,
And shouted, 'Get me to the Ball!
'There is a Disco at the Palace!
'The rest have gone and I am jealous!
'I want a dress! I want a coach!
'And earrings and a diamond brooch!
'And silver slippers, two of those!
'And lovely nylon panty hose!
'Done up like that I'll guarantee
'The handsome Prince will fall for me!'
The Fairy said, 'Hang on a tick.'
She gave her wand a mighty flick
And quickly, in no time at all,
Cindy was at the Palace Ball!
It made the Ugly Sisters wince
To see her dancing with the Prince.
She held him very tight and pressed
herself against his manly chest.
The Prince himself was turned to pulp,
All he could do was gasp and gulp.
Then midnight struck. She shouted,'Heck!
I've got to run to save my neck!'
The Prince cried, 'No! Alas! Alack!'
He grabbed her dress to hold her back.
As Cindy shouted, 'Let me go!'
The dress was ripped from head to toe.
She ran out in her underwear,
And lost one slipper on the stair.
The Prince was on it like a dart,
He pressed it to his pounding heart,
'The girl this slipper fits,' he cried,
'Tomorrow morn shall be my bride!
I'll visit every house in town
'Until I've tracked the maiden down!'
Then rather carelessly, I fear,
He placed it on a crate of beer.
At once, one of the Ugly Sisters,
(The one whose face was blotched with blisters)
Sneaked up and grabbed the dainty shoe,
And quickly flushed it down the loo.
Then in its place she calmly put
The slipper from her own left foot.
Ah ha, you see, the plot grows thicker,
And Cindy's luck starts looking sicker.
Next day, the Prince went charging down
To knock on all the doors in town.
In every house, the tension grew.
Who was the owner of the shoe?
The shoe was long and very wide.
(A normal foot got lost inside.)
Also it smelled a wee bit icky.
(The owner's feet were hot and sticky.)
Thousands of eager people came
To try it on, but all in vain.
Now came the Ugly Sisters' go.
One tried it on. The Prince screamed, 'No!'
But she screamed, 'Yes! It fits! Whoopee!
'So now you've got to marry me!'
The Prince went white from ear to ear.
He muttered, 'Let me out of here.'
'Oh no you don't! You made a vow!
'There's no way you can back out now!'
'Off with her head!'The Prince roared back.
They chopped it off with one big whack.
This pleased the Prince. He smiled and said,
'She's prettier without her head.'
Then up came Sister Number Two,
Who yelled, 'Now I will try the shoe!'
'Try this instead!' the Prince yelled back.
He swung his trusty sword and smack
Her head went crashing to the ground.
It bounced a bit and rolled around.
In the kitchen, peeling spuds,
Cinderella heard the thuds
Of bouncing heads upon the floor,
And poked her own head round the door.
'What's all the racket? 'Cindy cried.
'Mind your own bizz,' the Prince replied.
Poor Cindy's heart was torn to shreds.
My Prince! she thought. He chops off heads!
How could I marry anyone
Who does that sort of thing for fun?
The Prince cried, 'Who's this dirty slut?
'Off with her nut! Off with her nut!'
Just then, all in a blaze of light,
The Magic Fairy hove in sight,
Her Magic Wand went swoosh and swish!
'Cindy! 'she cried, 'come make a wish!
'Wish anything and have no doubt
'That I will make it come about!'
Cindy answered, 'Oh kind Fairy,
'This time I shall be more wary.
'No more Princes, no more money.
'I have had my taste of honey.
I'm wishing for a decent man.
'They're hard to find. D'you think you can?'
Within a minute, Cinderella
Was married to a lovely feller,
A simple jam maker by trade,
Who sold good home-made marmalade.
Their house was filled with smiles and laughter
And they were happy ever after."
2589,Emotion,CinderellaPoemsCinderellaPoembyAnneSexton,"You always read about it:
the plumber with the twelve children
who wins the Irish Sweepstakes.
From toilets to riches.
That story.
Or the nursemaid,
some luscious sweet from Denmark
who captures the oldest son's heart.
from diapers to Dior.
That story.
Or a milkman who serves the wealthy,
eggs, cream, butter, yogurt, milk,
the white truck like an ambulance
who goes into real estate
and makes a pile.
From homogenized to martinis at lunch.
Or the charwoman
who is on the bus when it cracks up
and collects enough from the insurance.
From mops to Bonwit Teller.
That story.
Once
the wife of a rich man was on her deathbed
and she said to her daughter Cinderella:
Be devout. Be good. Then I will smile
down from heaven in the seam of a cloud.
The man took another wife who had
two daughters, pretty enough
but with hearts like blackjacks.
Cinderella was their maid.
She slept on the sooty hearth each night
and walked around looking like Al Jolson.
Her father brought presents home from town,
jewels and gowns for the other women
but the twig of a tree for Cinderella.
She planted that twig on her mother's grave
and it grew to a tree where a white dove sat.
Whenever she wished for anything the dove
would dropp it like an egg upon the ground.
The bird is important, my dears, so heed him.
Next came the ball, as you all know.
It was a marriage market.
The prince was looking for a wife.
All but Cinderella were preparing
and gussying up for the event.
Cinderella begged to go too.
Her stepmother threw a dish of lentils
into the cinders and said: Pick them
up in an hour and you shall go.
The white dove brought all his friends;
all the warm wings of the fatherland came,
and picked up the lentils in a jiffy.
No, Cinderella, said the stepmother,
you have no clothes and cannot dance.
That's the way with stepmothers.
Cinderella went to the tree at the grave
and cried forth like a gospel singer:
Mama! Mama! My turtledove,
send me to the prince's ball!
The bird dropped down a golden dress
and delicate little slippers.
Rather a large package for a simple bird.
So she went. Which is no surprise.
Her stepmother and sisters didn't
recognize her without her cinder face
and the prince took her hand on the spot
and danced with no other the whole day.
As nightfall came she thought she'd better
get home. The prince walked her home
and she disappeared into the pigeon house
and although the prince took an axe and broke
it open she was gone. Back to her cinders.
These events repeated themselves for three days.
However on the third day the prince
covered the palace steps with cobbler's wax
and Cinderella's gold shoe stuck upon it.
Now he would find whom the shoe fit
and find his strange dancing girl for keeps.
He went to their house and the two sisters
were delighted because they had lovely feet.
The eldest went into a room to try the slipper on
but her big toe got in the way so she simply
sliced it off and put on the slipper.
The prince rode away with her until the white dove
told him to look at the blood pouring forth.
That is the way with amputations.
They just don't heal up like a wish.
The other sister cut off her heel
but the blood told as blood will.
The prince was getting tired.
He began to feel like a shoe salesman.
But he gave it one last try.
This time Cinderella fit into the shoe
like a love letter into its envelope.
At the wedding ceremony
the two sisters came to curry favor
and the white dove pecked their eyes out.
Two hollow spots were left
like soup spoons.
Cinderella and the prince
lived, they say, happily ever after,
like two dolls in a museum case
never bothered by diapers or dust,
never arguing over the timing of an egg,
never telling the same story twice,
never getting a middle-aged spread,
their darling smiles pasted on for eternity.
Regular Bobbsey Twins.
That story."

And not just dust either
Stop doing those chores

Not as a maid but who you really are
Go a different route
You will shine like a star
Cinderella, why don’t you let the beauty out?
The prince will like you for you

To give a company with courage
How best both the ends to meet and manage!
Delightful figure to a small child
Stick on hand but at heart good and mild
No one can control her when turned wild
If honor and pride was to be seen as blind
As daughter too shown enough of affection
No protest to any one if beaten with reaction
Not only equal love to father, mother and brothers
But around all who live in vicinity and as neighbors
Good teacher, good economist and now good administrator
Right from councilor to chief minister and prime minister
Has served the head of the nation and now liberty torch bearer
Women can lead honorable life without any fear
Sky they have explored and proved good scientists
Stood as solid rock and faced rough weather amidst
So to say bow the head to the feat of glorious mother
Be she a lover, friend, sister or in form of any other"

A path for us
To follow and excel."

Though her lips were
More red than coral
More erect her breast
Than the cliff Everest
Yet I get more taste
In the soft touch
More delight in the eyes
Of my success
When we walk
Hand in hand
Side by side
People see and awe
Our dazzling beauty
Spread all over
As I know
Success makes a man more handsome
So I see a bevy in queue
Posing as lover
But my success
I love her more
When she speaks
Oh, I am out of things to compare
Me and my success
Least I can say
I notice  people
To sigh and  wonder!"

Is the one ideal, worthwhile.
And even when he fails,
He accepts it with smile!

Who has conquered all feats,
But he who the world envies
Even in his greatest defeats!

2602,Emotion,SuccessPoemsTheSuccessStoryPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"We are dreamy creature
Long for the things which is unsure
Why does then human being dream?
When they can't think of forming even a team
Each time we dream and remain quiet
Allow the spring to pass off and autumn to let
No one has changed their style except man
We are no exception but remain unchanged as human
Dreams are always beautiful
Sometimes provide key to be successful
We laugh it out and take no note
Meanwhile the water may seep in and sink the boat
Dreams need nice push
Credible effort without any rush
It may definitely pay in long run
As nothing is impossible under the Sun
Not all the kids survive after birth
Not all the pots come out safe even if nicely berthed
So think of some success after great struggle
It is yardstick for every thing to succeed little
It is always nice to think high
Couple it with dreamy planning slight
It may come off the ground well
Success story may thereafter definitely tell"

Hard work, honesty and humility,

Kindness in thought, word and deed and
laziness always kept at bay.
Making the most of your time,
never thinking of ever giving up

putting your heart, mind and soul into everything,
questioning yourself all the time and
rectifying mistakes made along the way.
Self-confidence and a strong desire
to make it to the finish line…
using whatever resources available and
vocalizing only positive thoughts.
When things don’t seem to go your way,

However long, one’s span of life is short;
Our little problems should not despair bring,
Nor steal the liveliness of our dear heart.
So, think aright; solutions surely come;
‘Never give up, ’- is the great man’s secret!
Great things are done by the blind, deaf and dumb;
Don’t be lazy; waste not time, fume or fret.
The biggest tree was born a sapling first;
All mammoth tasks can be broken to bits;
To do a thing that’s great, labor we must;
Sustained effort is important, not fits.
And start, we must from scratch some day, some way;
Earlier the better, you should not delay!

2607,Emotion,SuccessPoemsSuccessAndFailurePoembyDavidHarris,"Someone once called me a failure
for the publications that I lacked,
but I think they were wrong,
Success is not how much money
or gold that you earn.
Success is how many friends
in your life can hold,
for they are more precious
than money or gold.
Friendship has no price tag,
it cannot be bought or sold
and it comes from a heart of gold.
Therefore, in the future
any friends you may acquire
treat them with respect
unless you wish
their friendship to expire.

2608,Emotion,SuccessPoemsRoadToSuccessPoembyPRATIKSHAJAIN,"The road to success is not straight,
There is a curve called FAILURE,
A loop called CONFUSION,
Speed bumps called FRIENDS,
Red light called ENEMIES and
caution lights called FAMILY.
But if you have a spare called
DETERMINATION,
An engine called PERSEVERANCE,
Insurance called FAITH and
A driver called JESUS (GOD, ALLAH, ISHVAR)
You will make it to a place called
SUCCESS"
2609,Emotion,SuccessPoemsSonnetFailuresTooBringSuccessPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"Just like how ocean’s waves all fall and rise,
Again, again incessantly, forev’r!
When failures come, remain we must most wise,
And try again, again but quit never.
The greatest men had failures too, much more;
Yet undeterred, they fought their way through them;
Recurrent failures could open new door;
Perseverance must be success emblem.
Learn from each failure but never look back;
Let world comment and mock, ’tis not for long;
But never do become lethargic/ slack;
No one predicts when rings your success gong!
Great men were dull once but never gave up;
Always in life, like a steed you gallop."
2610,Emotion,SuccessPoemsMySuccessIsMyWifePoembyRaviSathasivam,"How I have achieved my success
because a woman behind my shadow
She is my ever loving wife and guardian
She made our family strong well
and she is the pillar of our family who hold us all
She take cares of everything without time limit
and put everything in order to make us easy
She has shown us her faith to over come any obstacles
and at the same time any problems dealt with properly
As a mother she never grow old and mould her heart for us with gold
She teach our children well and they learn so well
She blends her love with sincerity and hard to define
She brings us together always to be all in one family.
She always look for the best in us and give us best she had
She is my love and wife where these things abide
and my success was completed when she become my shadow"

O Lord! don't give me success,

2613,Emotion,SuccessPoemsSonnetHowToReapSuccessPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"Many things man wants to do in his life,
By roads easy and free himself from strife;
And many times he fails by foolish plans,
And designs, he ambitions tallness sans.
Failures are due to poor strategy oft,
And determinations that become soft;
Choosing the right field is quite important;
Come success to those who work incessant.
Weigh then the pros and cons of doing things,
And estimate the profit/ stress, life brings;
Check out if body’s fit for hardest work;
In case you fail, then never go berserk.
Faith, hope and hard work are most crucial things,
And this is true too of Poesy’s Wings."
2614,Emotion,SuccessPoemsCorporateSuccessPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"As you're walkin' down the street
dreaming of a better day
please look down, close to your feet
floats a shadow, and it may
look familiar to your eyes
it is always there for you
never tells you little lies
never gives the slightest clue.
It is Death, your dearest friend
he will stay until you die
go, look down but do not bend
do not ask him when and why.
Just remember when you fret
that your profit is too meagre
that the only foolproof bet
quite regardless of how eager
you live out your precious time
is the fact that it will end.
Up the ladder you may climb
when suddenly the Gods will send
one brief signal to your keeper
and you slide, with care, back down
as he shows you, your grim reaper:
No pockets in your final gown."
2615,Emotion,SuccessPoemsVictimOfHisOwnSuccessPoembyJonathanROBIN,"Man, victim of his own success, must fast grasp opportunity
to offer all equality of chances and advances stress
as the ability to press for rights for disability
the strong ignore, or fail to bless.
Man, victim of his own success, does not deserve impunity
when biosphere supportive he still stifles in the name of, - guess, -
‘Democracy’, free-choice oppress through ways of ta[l]king liberty
as only freedom to repress.
Man, victim of his own success, - tale’s pun, - few marks of modesty
retains, yet with anxiety observes galactic game of chess
while most Earth’s problems won’t address.  This manifest dichotomy
highlights concerns we should assess.
Man, victim of his own success, needs to transcend his history
predative, channel energy towards solutions which suppress
his immaturity, redress the balance of society,
extend awareness free from stress.
Man, victim of his own success, must sail beyond tsunami he
created to a safer sea where winds of change may not express
a whirlwind strange that all confess none can control. Society
must change or soon will sink, regress.
Man, victim of his own success, must map return to sanity,
respect with assiduity the planet’s need to convalesce,
create conditions which attest acceptance by humanity
of overview which won’t aggress.
Man, victim of his own success, must understand ecology
requires intrinsic harmony, may join “I wish”  to “I possess”
providing much more, - never less, - is harvested with equity,
without the urge to dispossess.
Man, victim of his own success should heed the lessons most agree
accompany pride’s apogee, and not attempt to second guess
the seasons’ reasons or finesse.  Where just fat few progress we see
misuse far more than maladdresse.
Man, victim of his own success, beyond base skills of repartee,
should take time off from Time to key into distortions which transgress
ideals which should not ever stress the views of tight community
or vested interests.  Nonetheless, -
Man, victim of his own success, must meet the challenges that he
has catalyzed - calamity around the corner waits unless
he acts -  declines to acquiesque with urbane equanimity, -
protects his progeny’s success…
Which, victim of its own success, may stray from birthright destiny
to cul-de-sac of history, through compromise, increase distress
or narrow hopes where scope could press for change proactive, remedy
renewed temptations to digress through need to influence, impress,
the generations yet to be, compress its chances - tragedy
whose risks too high remain as we depict the options which depress
the outlook for our century.

2619,Emotion,SuccessPoemsLovesSuccessPoembyMakarandParanjape,"Love always exceeds its objects
which, however great or beautiful,
are subject to time, decay, and death:
after their brief season in the sun,
they lose their fresh bloom, so magical,
and harden slowly or rot in their youth.
But love remains eternally youthful,
whether embodied as a silly, naked boy
wilfully shooting his invisible darts
at unsuspecting victims, or entirely bodiless,
too subtle to behold, but still quivering
in every heart's secret places.  Love is not
subject to us, but we are subject to it:
it changes its objects like soiled garments
or the deathless soul it's transient bodies.
[From Partial Disclosure]"
2620,Emotion,SuccessPoemsSuccessPoembyRupertBrooke,"I think if you had loved me when I wanted;
If I'd looked up one day, and seen your eyes,
And found my wild sick blasphemous prayer granted,
And your brown face, that's full of pity and wise,
Flushed suddenly; the white godhead in new fear
Intolerably so struggling, and so shamed;
Most holy and far, if you'd come all too near,
If earth had seen Earth's lordliest wild limbs tamed,
Shaken, and trapped, and shivering, for MY touch --
Myself should I have slain? or that foul you?
But this the strange gods, who had given so much,
To have seen and known you, this they might not do.
One last shame's spared me, one black word's unspoken;
And I'm alone; and you have not awoken."
2621,Emotion,SuccessPoemsSuccessComesToCowCreekPoembyJamesTate,"I sit on the tracks,
a hundred feet from
earth, fifty from the
water. Gerald is
inching toward me
as grim, slow, and
determined as a
season, because he
has no trade and wants
none. It's been nine months
since I last listened
to his fate, but I
know what he will say:
he's the fire hydrant
of the underdog.
When he reaches my
point above the creek,
he sits down without
salutation, and
spits profoundly out
past the edge, and peeks
for meaning in the
ripple it brings. He
scowls. He speaks: when you
walk down any street
you see nothing but
coagulations
of shit and vomit,
and I'm sick of it.
I suggest suicide;
he prefers murder,
and spits again for
the sake of all the
great devout losers.
A conductor's horn
concerto breaks the
air, and we, two doomed
pennies on the track,
shove off and somersault
like anesthetized
fleas, ruffling the
ideal locomotive
poised on the water
with our light, dry bodies.
Gerald shouts
terrifically as
he sails downstream like
a young man with a
destination. I
swim toward shore as
fast as my boots will

neglecting to drown."
2622,Emotion,SuccessPoemsAnOdeHumblyInscribedToTheQueenOnTheGloriousSuccessOfHerMajestysArmsPoembyMatthewPrior,"When great Augustus govern'd ancient Rome,
And sent his conquering bands to foreign wars,
Abroad when dreaded, and beloved at home,
He saw his fame increasing with his years,
Horace, great bard, (so fate ordain'd) arose,
And, bold as were his countryman in fight,
Snatch'd their fair actions from degrading prose,
And set their battles in eternal light:
High as their trumpets tune his lyre he strung,
And with his prince's arms he moralized his song.
When bright Eliza ruled Britannia's state,
Widely distributing her high commands,
And, boldly wise and fortunately great,
Freed the glad nations from tyrannic bands,
An equal genius was in Spenser found;
To the high theme he match'd his noble lays;
He travelled England o'er on fairy ground,
In mystic notes to sing his monarch's praise:
Reciting wondrous truths in pleasing dreams
He deck'd Eliza's head with Gloriana's beams.
But, greatest Anna! while thy arms pursue
Paths of renown, and climb ascents of fame,
Which nor Augustus nor Eliza knew,
What poet shall be found to sing thy name?
What numbers shall record, what tongue shall say
Thy wars on land, thy triumphs on the main?
O fairest model of imperial sway!
What equal pen shall write thy wondrous reign?
Who shall attempts and feats of arms rehearse,
Nor yet by story told, nor parallel'd by verse?
Me all too mean for such a task I weet;
Yet if the sovereign Lady designs to smile
I'll follow Horace with impetuous heat,
And clothe the verse in Spenser's native style:
By these examples rightly taught to sing,
And smit with pleasure of my country's praise,
Stretching the plumes of an uncommon wing,
High as Olympus I my flight will raise,
And latest times shall in my numbers read
Anna's immortal fame and Marlborough's hardy deed.
As the strong eagle in the silent wood,
Mindless of warlike rage and hostile care,
Plays round the rocky cliff or crystal flood,
Till by Jove's high behests call'd out to war,
And charged with thunder of his angry king,
His bosom with the vengeful message glows,
Upward the noble bird directs his wing,
And towering round his master's earth-born foes,
Swift he collects his fatal stock of ire,
Lifts his fierce talon high, and darts the forked fire.
Sedate and calm thus victor Marlborough sate,
Shaded with laurels, in his native land,
Till Anna calls him from his soft retreat,
And gives her second thunder to his hand:
Then leaving sweet repose and gentle ease,
With ardent speed he seeks the distant foe,
Marching o'er hills and vales, o'er rocks and seas,
He meditates and strikes the wondrous blow.
Our thought flies slower than our General's fame;
Grasps he the bolt? (we ask) when he has hurl'd the flame.
When fierce Bavar on Judoign's spacious plain
Did from afar the British chief behold,
Betwixt despair, and rage, and hope, and pain,
Something within his warring bosom roll'd:
He views that favourite of indulgent Fame,
Whom whilom he had met on Ister's shore;
Too well, alas! the man he knows the same
Whose prowess there repell'd the Boyan power,
And sent them trembling thro' the frighted lands,
Swift as the whirlwind drives Arabia's scatter'd sands.
His former losses he forgets to grieve;
Absolves his fate with a kinder ray
It now would shine, and only give him leave
To balance the account of Blenheim's day.
So the fell lion, in the lonely glade,
His side still smarting with the hunter's spear,
Though deeply wounded, no way yet dismay'd,
Roars terrible, and meditates new war,
In sullen fury traverses the plain
To find the venturous foe, and battle him again.
Misguided prince, no longer urge thy fate,
Nor tempt the hero to unequal war;
Famed in misfortune, and in ruin great,
Confess the force of Malbro's stronger star.
Those laurel groves (the merits of thy youth)
Which thou from Mahomet didst greatly gain,
While, bold assertor of resistless truth,
Thy sword did godlike Liberty maintain.
Must from thy brow their falling honours shed,
And their transplanted wreaths must deck a worthier head.
Yet cease the ways of Providence to blame,
And human faults with human grief confess;
'Tis thou art changed, while Heaven is still the same;
From thy ill counsels date thy ill success:
Impartial Justice holds her equal scales,
Till stronger virtue does the weight incline;
If over thee thy glorious foe prevails,
He now defends the cause that once was thine.
Righteous the war, the champion shall subdue,
For Jove's great handmaid, Power, must Jove's decrees pursue.
Hark! the dire trumpets sound their shrill alarms!
Auverqueque, branch'd from the renown'd Nassaus,
Hoary in war, and bent beneath his arms,
His glorious sword with dauntless courage draws.
When anxious Britain mourn'd her parting lord,
And all of William that was mortal died,
The faithful hero had received his sword
From his expiring master's much-loved side:
Oft from its fatal ire has Louis flown,
Where'er great William led or Maese and Sambre run.
But brandish'd high, in an ill-omen'd hour
To thee, proud Gaul, behold thy justest fear,
The master-sword, disposer of thy power:
'Tis that which Caesar gave the British peer.
He took the gift: Nor ever will I sheath
This steel (so Anna's high behests ordain)
The General said, unless by glorious death
Absolved, till conquest has confirm'd your reign.
Returns like these our mistress bids us make,
When from a foreign prince a gift her Britons take.
And now fierce Gallia rushes on her foes,
Her force augmented by the Boyan bands;
So Volga's stream, increased by mountain snows,
Rolls with new fury down through Russia's lands.
Like two great rocks against the raging tide
(If Virtue's force with Nature's we compare)
Unmoved the two united chiefs abide,
Sustain the impulse, and receive the war:
Round their firm sides in vain the tempest beats,
And still the foaming wave with lessen'd power retreats.
The rage dispersed, the glorious pair advance,
With mingled anger and collected might,
To turn the war, and tell aggressing France
How Britain's sons and Britain's friends can fight.
On conquest fix'd, and covetous of fame,
Behold them rushing through the Gallic host;
Through standing corn so runs the sudden flame,
Or eastern winds along Sicilia's coast.
They deal their terrors to the adverse nation:
Pale Death attends their arms, and ghastly Desolation.
But while with fiercest ire Bellona glows,
And Europe rather hopes than fears her fate,
While Britain presses her afflicted foes,
What horror damps the strong and quells the great?
Whence look the soldier's cheeks dismay'd and pale?
Erst ever dreadful, know they now to dread?
The hostile troops, I ween, almost prevail,
And the pursuers only not recede.
Alas! their lessen'd rage proclaims their grief!
For anxious, lo! they crowd around their falling chief.
I thank thee, Fate, exclaims the fierce Bavar;
Let Boya's trumpet graceful Io's sound;
I saw him fall, their thunderbolt of war; -
Ever to Vengeance sacred be the ground -
Vain wish! short joy! the hero mounts again
In greater glory, and with fuller light;
The evening star so falls into the main,
To rise at morn more prevalently bright.
He rises safe, but near, too near his side,
A good man's grievous loss, a faithful servant died.
Propitious Mars! the battle is regain'd';
The foe with lessen'd wrath disputes the field:
The Briton fights, by favoring gods sustain'd;
Freedom must live, and lawless power must yield.
Vain now the tales which fabling poets tell,
That wavering Conquest still desires to rove!
In Marlbro's camp the goddess knows to dwell;
Long as the hero's life remains her love.
Again France flies, again the Duke pursues,
And on Ramilia's plains he Blenheim's fame renews.
Great thanks, O Captain, great in arms! receive
From thy triumphant country's public voice;
Thy country greater thanks can only give
To Anne, to her who made those arms her choice.
Recording Schellenberg's and Blenheim's toils,
We dreaded lest thou should'st those toils repeat:
We view'd the palace charged with Gallic spoils,
And in those spoils we thought thy praise complete.
For never Greek we deem'd, nor Roman knight,
In characters like these did e'er his acts indite.
Yet, mindless still of ease, thy virtue flies
A pitch to old and modern times unknown:
Those goodly deeds, which we so highly prize,
Imperfect seem, great Chief, to thee alone.
Those heights, where William's virtue might have staid,
And on the subject world look'd safely down,
By Marlbro's pass'd, the props and steps were made
Sublimer yet to raise his Queen's renown:
Still gaining more, still slighting what he gain'd,
Nought done the hero deem'd while ought undone remain'd.
When swift-wing'd Rumour told the mighty Gaul
How lessen'd from the field Bavar was fled,
He wept the swiftness of the champion's fall,
And thus the royal treaty-breaker said:
And lives he yet, the great, the lost Bavar,
Ruin to Gallia in the name of friend?
Tell me how far has Fortune been severe?
Has the foe's glory of our grief an end?
Remains there, of the fifty thousand lost,
To save our threaten'd realm, or guard our shatter'd coast?
To the close rock the frighted raven flies,
Soon as the rising eagle cuts the air
The shaggy wolf unseen and trembling lies,
When the hoarse roar proclaims the lion near:
Ill starr'd did we our forts and lines forsake,
To dare our British foes to open fight:
Our conquest we by stategem should make:
'Tis ours by craft and by surprise to gain:
'Tis theirs, to meet in arms, and battle in the plain.
The ancient father of this hostile brood,
Their boasted Brute, undaunted snatch'd his gods
From burning Troy, and Xanthus red with blood,
And fix'd on silver Thames his dire abodes:
And this be Trynovante, he said, the seat
By Heaven ordain'd, my sons, your lasting place:
Superior here to all the bolts of fate
Live, mindful of the author of your race,
Whom neither Greece, nor war, nor want, nor flame,
Nor great Pelides' arm, nor Juno's rage, could tame.
Their Tudors hence, and Stuart's offspring flow:
Hence Edward, dreadful with his sable shield,
Talbot to Gallia's power eternal foe,
And Seymour, famed in council or in field:
Hence Nevel, great to settle or dethrone,
And Drake, and Ca'ndish, terrors of the sea:
Hence Butler's sons, o'er land and ocean known,
Herbert's and Churchill's warring progeny:
Hence the long roll which Gallia should conceal:
For, oh! who, vanquish'd, loves the victor's fame to tell?
Envy'd Britannia, sturdy as the oak,
Which on her mountain top she proudly bears,
Eludes the axe, and sproutes against the stroke;
Strong from her wounds, and greater by her wars.
And as those teeth, which Cadmus sow'd in earth,
Produced new youth, and furnish'd fresh supplies;
So with young vigour, and succeeding birth,
Her losses more than recompensed arise;
And every age she with a race is crown'd,
For letters more polite, in battles more renown'd.
Obstinate power, whom nothing can repel;
Not the fierce Saxon, nor the cruel Dane,
Nor deep impression of the Norman steel,
Nor Europe's force amass'd by envious Spain.
Nor France on universal sway intent,
Oft breaking leagues, and oft renewing wars;
Nor (frequent bane of weaken'd government)
Their own intestine feuds and mutual jars;
Those feuds and jars, in which I trusted more,
Than in my troops, and fleets, and all the Gallic power.
To fruitful Rheims, or fair Lutetia's gate,
What tidings shall the messenger convey?
Shall the loud herald our success relate,
Or mitred priest appoint the solemn day?
Alas! my praises they no more must sing;
They to my statue now must bow no more;
Broken, repulsed is their immortal king:
Fall'n, fall'n for ever, is the Gallic power.-
The woman chief is master of the war:
Earth she has freed by arms, and vanquish'd Heaven by prayer.
While thus the ruin'd foe's despair commends
Thy council and thy deed, victorious queen,
What shall thy subjects say, and what thy friends;
How shall thy triumphs in our joy be seen?
Oh! deign to let the eldest of the nine
Recite Britannia great and Gallia free;
Oh! with her sister Sculpture let her join
To raise, great Anne, the monument to thee;
To thee, of all our good the sacred spring;
To thee, our dearest dread; to thee, our softer king.
Let Europe, saved, the column high erect,
Than Trojan's higher, or than Antonine's,
Where sembling art may carve the fair effect
And full achievement of thy great designs,
In a calm heaven and a serener air
Sublime the queen shall on the summit stand,
From danger far, as far removed from fear,
And pointing down to earth her dread command.
All winds, all storms, that threaten human wo
Shall sink beneath her feet, and spread their rage below.
There fleets shall strive, by winds and waters tost,
Till the young Austrian on Iberia's strand,
Great as AEneas on the Latian coast
Shall fix his foot: And this, be this the land,
Great Jove, where I for ever will remain,
(The empire's other hope shall say) and here
Vanquish'd, intomb'd I'll lie, or crown'd I'll reign -
O Virtue, to thy British Mother dear!
Like the famed Trojan suffer and abide:
For Anne is thine, I ween, as Venus was his guide.
There, in eternal characters engraved,
Vigo, and Gibraltar, and Barcelone,
Their force destroy'd, their privileges saved,
Shall Anna's terrors and her mercies own:
Spain, from the usurper Bourbon's arms retrieved,
Shall with new life and grateful joy appear,
Numbering the wonders which that youth achieved
Whom Anna clad in arms and sent to war,
Whom Anna sent to claim Iberia's throne,
And made him more than king in calling him her son.
There Isther, pleased by Blenheim's glorious field,
Rolling, shall bid his eastern waves declare
Germania saved by Britain's ample shield,
And bleeding Gaul afflicted by her spear;
Shall bid them mention Marlbro', on that shore
Leading his islanders renown'd in arms,
Through climes where never British chief before
Or pitch'd his camp, or sounded his alarms;
Shall bid them bless the queen, who made his streams
Glorious as those of Boyne, and safe as those of Thames.
Brabantia, clad with fields, and crown'd with towers,
With decent joy shall her deliverer meet,
Shall own thy arms, great queen, and bless thy powers,
Laying the keys beneath thy subject's feet.
Flandria, by plenty made the home of war,
Shall weep her crime, and bow to Charles restored,
With double vows shall bless thy happy care
In having drawn and having sheathed the sword,
From these their sister provinces shall know
How Anne supports a friend, and how forgives a foe.
Bright swords, and crested helms, and pointed spears,
In artful piles around the work shall lie;
And shields indented deep in ancient wars,
Blazon'd with signs of Gallic heraldry;
And standards with distinguish'd honours bright,
Marks of high power and national command,
Which Valois' sons, and Bourbon's bore in fight,
Or gave to Foix', or Montmorancy's hand;
Great spoils, which Gallia must to Britain yield,
From Cressy's battle saved to grace Ramilia's field.
And, as fine art the spaces may dispose,
The knowing thought and curious eye shall see
Thy emblem, gracious queen, the British rose,
Type of sweet rule and gentle majesty:
The northern thistle, whom no hostile hand
Unhurt too rudely may provoke, I ween;
Hibernia's harp, device of her command,
And parent of her mirth shall there be seen:
Thy vanquish'd lilies, France, decay'd and torn,
Shall with disorder'd pomp the lasting work adorn.
Beneath, great queen, oh! very far beneath,
Next to the ground and on the humble base,
To save herself from darkness and from death,
That muse desires the last, the lowest place;
Who, though unmeet, yet touch'd the trembling string,
For the fair fame of Anne and Albion's land,
Who durst of war and martial fury sing;
And when thy will, and when thy subject's hand,
Had quell'd those wars, and bid that fury cease,
Hangs up her grateful harp to conquest, and to peace."

Even failure can become an important ingredient to success.
Failure just means that you have not yet succeeded.
I’d rather change my mind and succeed than have my own way and fail.  Success without conflict is unrealistic.
Any person can be successful on smooth seas,
but it is the victory over the storm that gains true honor.
Success doesn’t come through the way you think it comes;
it comes through the way you think.
Never settle for less than success.
Success is doing something good.
When you can, where you can, while you can.
It’s better to attempt to do something great and fail,
than attempt to do nothing and succeed.
Success is not necessarily reaching your goal- but reaching the maximum possibilities in light of the opportunities that come your way.
To keep your values on target remember to live so that when you “arrive”, you’ll have pride behind you and hope ahead of you.
The success is truly the path to heaven.
Success is never ending, because success is like the process of seed planting.  Every creative contribution like a seed planted may bear fruit.
Success finally is not what you have it is not what you do;
it is who you are, and what
you want to become of yourself."

2628,Emotion,SuccessPoemsICraveForSuccessPoembyVyktorEkott,"I dream the future without the past
Of when my success will be a blast
Intent of heart, I see the best
Hope for the future, with God I rest.
I crave for success, I hope for hope
God start the process, I crave to cope.
I see a flash, a flash of hope
I'm up the mountain, nomore the slope
Lord take me higher, Lord take me up
Mobilize the process, and do not stop.
I crave for success, I hope for hope
God start the process, I crave to cope.
Night and day, I hope in silence
The possibility of a future so dense
If I persevere, and continue hoping
Then my future will cease from joking.
I crave for success, I hope for hope
God start the process, I crave to cope."
2629,Emotion,SuccessPoemsWhatDefinesSuccessPoembyAlishaRicks,"What is the journey to success?
Success is not gained by defeat
Success does not occur over night
Success can emerge at any age
Success is working to full potential
Success is courage
Success is lending a hand
Success is not listening to negativity
Success is being positive
Success is living your life instead of the life of others
Success is being proud
Success is overcoming obstacles
Success is striving
Success is listening to your heart
Most of all success is accepting
What you have accomplished"
2630,Emotion,SuccessPoemsBXiiSadnessInSuccessPoembyDouglasScotney,"The best of the other in the one.
The best of the one in the other.
Either in the one or the other,
the best of the other or the one.
The success that lies in sadness,
the sadness in success.
The honour and the love.
Best below, above."
2631,Emotion,SuccessPoemsTheToolboxOfSuccessPoembyAmritRathi,"Today we will open the Toolbox of Success
and examine each tool,
so as to succeed in everything
using it to the very full.
Ok. You're getting angry, but can you wait?
Or switch off this TV, to study even if it’s late?
Or forego the burger to save your health?
Or try to be humble in spite of your wealth?
You need the patience
to forego something minor now,
to achieve something major in the future:
this is the essence.
So patience is the most powerful tool
to fool around
for success in everything;
it lays the ground.
It is a bit difficult, though a rewarding journey:
from instant pleasure to efforts for the future,
from temptation of now to wait and nurture,
and you're in control all around.
Again—are you grumbling or blaming others?
Or do you take full responsibility for your affairs?
Either you won't see what’s that bothers
or you’ll be able to decide and take all the cares.
So assuming responsibility’s another powerful tool
to fool around
for success in everything;
it lays the ground.
It is a bit difficult, though a rewarding journey:
from shifting blame to accepting your faults,
from defense mechanism to confidence-vault,
and you're in control all around.
Again—are you constantly updated with realty?
And use new ideas to fuel your imagination?
Either you're open with all options, possibilities,
or stuck in the old rut with knee-jerk reaction.
Determining what applies to a situation is a powerful tool
to fool around
for success in everything;
it lays the ground.
It is a bit difficult, though a rewarding journey:
from the rigid outlook to a flexible approach,
from sheer stagnation to change is brought,
and you're in control all around.
When and how much of these techniques but to use:
to enjoy the beauty of a flower should you choose?
or when and how much even anger can be shown?
or take responsibility that's not yours even to muse?
or how much the new from the old is to be drawn?
This is called balancing, another powerful tool
to fool around
for success in everything;
it lays the ground.
It is a bit difficult, though a rewarding journey:
from strictly applying tools to modifying for need,
knowing how much discipline, the discipline needs?
And you're in control all around.
Finally, what is the toolbox of success that holds
all these tools, creating an urge in you so bold?
Love—that's what contains them all into its fold:
for his brighter future, a mother makes her son—
though it pains her—study hard and to slog on.
So from the Toolbox of Success, the love,
pick up these powerful tools
to fool around
for success in everything;
it lays the ground.

2632,Emotion,SuccessPoemsInSuccessInFailurePoembyGajananMishra,"In success in failure
Be even-minded
And go on
Doing your allotted work.
If you are the cause
In making your actions
Bear fruit
You are poor
You are wretched."
2633,Emotion,SuccessPoemsFailureAndSuccessPoembyDavidHarris,"Failure is the penalty,
for continually getting things wrong.
Success on the other hand is the award,
for getting things continually right.
Failure puts you down in despair.
Success sends you soaring among the clouds.
Therefore, I look at myself and wonder,
am I a success or failure.
Then maybe I am a bit of both.
Whichever way the hammer falls
only you can decide."

2635,Emotion,SuccessPoemsSuccessPoembyNiveditaChatterjee,"If I were to be not myself,
then I would rather not want this success,
If I were to unlearn all my values and principles,
then what is the use of learning the tactics of this success,
If I were to barter the blissful moments with my loved ones, for this maddening race, then I would prefer, this success, to not to be chased.
If my smile and emotions have to be fake,
then I would rather not socialize just for the heck (of it) .
Yes, it is important even for me to have success,
The realization of aspirations is what is my success.
The utilization of skills and tapping of potential, is what is my success..
The zeal to learn and always wanting to improve, is what is my success..
To compete with none but myself, is what is my success..
The satisfaction of giving and contributing, is my success..
I want this success and am moving only towards this SUCCESS! !"
2636,Emotion,SuccessPoemsHowDoYouMeasureSuccessPoembyTheresaAnnMoore,"How does a person determine his or her worth
You may ask what is your purpose on this earth
When you look for the answer... who do you ask
Who is appropriately delegated to take on the task
What scale of degrees will measure your qualities
Will you fill a predetermined mold and aim to please
Become self-sufficient while taking care of your needs
It is important to balance the budget with your proceeds
Become educated and develop skills with knowledge
Train to be someone who makes a sincere pledge
Fulfillment will tell you when you have finally arrived
Be content and satisfied... don’t let yourself be contrived
Reserve a portion of time for your family and friends
The caring attention you give has rewarding dividends
In the end, will you be able to say with a straight face…
I didn’t just take up space... I made the world a better place

2637,Emotion,SuccessPoemsSuccessPoembyRobertWilliamService,"You ask me what I call Success -
It is, I wonder, Happiness?
It is not wealth, it is not fame,
Nor rank, nor power nor honoured name.
It is not triumph in the Arts -
Best-selling books or leading parts.
It is not plaudits of the crowd,
The flame of flags, processions proud.
The panegyrics of the Press
are but the mirage of Success.
You may have all of them, my friend,
Yet be a failure in the end.
I've know proud Presidents of banks
Who've fought their way up from the ranks,
And party leaders of renown
Who played as boys in Shantytown.
Strong, self-made men, yet seek to trace
Benignity in any face;
Grim purpose, mastery maybe,
Yet never sweet serenity;
Never contentment, thoughts that bless -
That mellow joy I deem Success.
The haply seek some humble hearth,
Quite poor in goods yet rich in mirth,
And see a man of common clay
Watching his little ones at play;
A laughing fellow full of cheer,
Health, strength and faith that mocks at fear;
Who for his happiness relies
On joys he lights in other eyes;
He loves his home and envies none. . . .
Who happier beneath the sun?
Aye, though he walk in lowly ways,
Shining Success has crowned his days."

Without knowing, no work can be done.
All developments depend on work;
No work can be done without pain!
For, there can’t be gain without pain.
Pleasure can’t be enjoyed without pain;
Pain is the first step to pleasure ever.

Careful steps to the top lead to success;
Success is the top peak of the mountain.
Maintaining top level is next work;
Without maintaining top position
Success cannot be retained forever.

In their different ways people it do define
Some see success as money to your name
As a lack of such a barrier to fame
Though others with such thinking do not agree
Success in quite a different way they do see
They will tell you that you cannot know of success
If in your mind no room for happiness
And some do say for a successful life
You do not need what's known as inner strife
The successful person does seem quite carefree
On what success is so few do agree
We all do look at things quite differently
That's how it is and that's how 'twill always be."

2643,Emotion,SuccessPoemsHowDoYouDefineSuccessPoembyJuliusBabarinsa,"The word success means many things to many people
To be considered a success, means that you have made it
The question here is – made it as what?
How do you define success?
Is it by passing an exam?
Is it by becoming a landlord or landlady?
Is it by been promoted at work?
Is it by winning the lottery?
Is it by marrying the woman of your dreams?
Is it by marrying the man of your dreams?
Is it by been in an executive position?
Is it by winning an election?
How do you define success?
Are you successful as a pilot or a stewardess?
What does the word – “success” mean to you?
Is it by been the head of your organization?
Is it by having lots of money?
And how much money determines success?
Are you successful as a member of the armed forces?
Are you successful as a member of the police force?
What is your own definition of success?
Are you successful by been a writer, teacher,
Pastor, evangelist, taxi driver, congressperson,
Medical doctor or a reputed musician
Are you successful by been a sole proprietor
Mechanic, movie star, or the chairman of the board
Are you successful as an architect or builder?
Do you consider yourself a success as a banker?
Success is in the eyes of the beholder
The meaning of success varies and differs
From one person to the other"

I couldn't eat with the adults
'twas against her wishes
So I stand at the sink
I will wash her grime
but first, I think
that it's 'break time'"
2645,Emotion,SuccessPoemsSuccessPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"Success lies beneath the popular support
If you maintain contacts and good rapport
It will be great encouragement and strength
If maintained on same wavelength
What amounts to failure or success?
When you fail to have full access
Relentless efforts with continuous zeal
It will mark a” finish” with final seal
It makes very great difference?
If you fail to draw correct inference
You must heed and pay to an expert advice
When something fails as mechanical device
United we stand and divided we fall
If you not wake up and not heed to call
You can swim against rising waves
With resolute action ways may pave
People will be frustrated and annoyed
If message is not be properly conveyed
Close your hand and it will form strength
People will follow it with same good length
Young may have to sacrifice and die
Not to give way and not simply lie
It is need of an hour and must rise to occasion
Not to wait for chance or battle for succession
More you work in peace time than less you may bleed
Success may touch your feet and you may succeed
Why not take chance and work for peace?
Life may be normal and you may leave at  ease"

You are my faithful wife-and
No one would come
For your relationship,
Oh my defeat! You are my mirror,
You helped me to see my image,
O my defeat! You are eternal sculptor,
You are an evolution of man,
O my defeat! You are a melting plant,
You are giving weapons to combat my life
Oh my defeat! You are an affable heat,            (Pleasant, friendly)
You are shaping my character to glorify,
Oh my defeat! You are a sharpening stone,
You are making me clever in life,
Oh my defeat! You are my brilliant school,
You taught me to convert the cyclone as my boat,
Oh my defeat! You are my philosopher and guide,
You are refining my ego,
Oh my defeat! You are not my wounds,
But my eyes,
Oh my defeat! Your flame tuned me to the
Level of beautiful flute,
Oh my defeat! You are not creating any loss,
But you are involving me to attain experiences,
Success brings addiction to oneself,
And we lose ourselves,
O my defeat! You are my remunerations,
I can buy the success with that money.

2648,Emotion,SuccessPoemsTheRoadToSuccessPoembyMzHonestyOnly,"The road to success is not straight.
There is a curve called FAILURE,
A loop called CONFUSION,
Speed bumps called FRIENDS,
Red lights called ENEMIES,
Caution lights called FAMILY,
You will have flats called JOBS.
BUT
You do have a spare called DETERMINATION,
An engine called PERSEVERANCE,
Your insurance is called FAITH,
Your driver is GOD!
You will make it to the called SUCCESS, but
There will be one more trip to make.
And when that one is done,
Guess who will be there to welcome you?
And state to you' JOB WELL DONE'
May GRACE be with you and PEACE be upon you."

With milk and banana stock"
2650,Emotion,SuccessPoemsSuccessPoembyHenryLawson,"Did you see that man riding past,
With shoulders bowed with care?
There’s failure in his eyes to last,
And in his heart despair.
He seldom looks to left or right,
He nods, but speaks to none,
And he’s a man who fought the fight—
God knows how hard!—and won.
No great “review” could rouse him now,
No printed lies could sting;
No kindness smooth his knitted brow,
Nor wrong one new line bring.
Through dull, dumb days and brooding nights,
From years of storm and stress,
He’s riding down from lonely heights—
The Mountains of Success.
He sees across the darkening land
The graveyards on the coasts;
He sees the broken columns stand
Like cold and bitter ghosts;
His world is dead while yet he lives,
Though known in continents;
His camp is where his country gives
Its pauper monuments."
2651,Emotion,SuccessPoemsTheKeyToSuccessPoembySofiMartinez,"Education is relevant for a person to be successful.
Education empowers a person to become a leader.
Great opportunities are presented to professionals.
The future of a Person can be unpredictable if she lacks education;
an uneducated person does not have the knowledge
of what the future has to offer for her.
Education is an essential tool to make a pleasant and stable living out of a simple quotidian life.
High Education contributes to the increase of the graduate
in her social economic level.
Education is the main Factor for one to become wealthy,
Millionaire, or even
Multimillionaire.
Education offers the opportunity for a person
to become the owner of a mansion.
Education brings one the opportunity to please herself.
Perhaps, getting to travel often to interesting countries/places, or
to be the owner of the latest new brand sport car.
Education enables one to reach success.
Education makes one become influential.
Education gives one the opportunity to be
at the top with the highest wage.
Education gives one self-fulfillment.
A thief can take away money, a car, a property from a person.
but is definitely impossible to take education away from someone.
Education is worth $10,000 $50,000 $1000,000
0ne puts it value!
Education is certainly the main Element to become successful
and overall to reach one’s goals and dreams."

2655,Emotion,SuccessPoemsFemalesBehindSuccessPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"I dare not violate the woman’s modesty
It will be pure injustice and no honesty
The clouds may look dark and atmosphere little misty
But all this can be termed as impure and dirty
They have come into being of their own
God has given them delicate figure to maintain
If they look good and beautiful not their fault
Almighty has placed caring heart too and kept as inbuilt
How do we roam freely with joy in garden?
The flowers of all colors have emerged all of sudden
It is their presence to be felt in nice environment
Do they not deserve nice eyes to look at with comments?
I am fascinated with the way they open up and boom
They may not look that beautiful when decorated in room
They may add beauty and nicely adore
But we need to do something more
We appreciate feminist out look and touch
We do take care and appreciate very much
I love being very near to them and present
All that I could do without any reservation and not resent
I feel we have great and caring heart like female
In some of the fields they have outwitted males
Females have proved great artists and poets
Remain in doors still all fronts keeping very quiet
So much to learn from their feminist look and nature
They are great philosopher even if not fully matured
The motherly and caring nature all that very much assure
At least I feel honestly secured of near future
We may have different character inbuilt
We may show favor and make some tilt
Still they outsmart us in every field and make move
They have made their presence known and need not prove
Time and again it is male very clear
I hear it number of times and pleases ears
All stories about them have vanished like yesteryears
They are dear alright but so much to be afraid of or fear
They are submissive but not to the extent beyond limit
They have dedication and will power to show and exhibit
We can not be unsecured or unsafe in their orbit
It will be too naïve to disregard or praise little bit
We are soft and fragile on women
Even though we are wild animal but appear as strong man
Not all the men derive their strength from women partners
Still they remain as driving force to be reckoned with care"

The man  would be also
Relieved from sinful

And reaches ‘haven or hell’,
Who knows? ..,
And he does not know
When the heart wins;
But the clans know the day
When it happens..."

By those who ne'er succeed.

As he defeated--dying--
On whose forbidden ear
The distant strains of triumph
Burst agonized and clear!"

2659,Emotion,SuccessPoemsSuccessPoembyKavya,"What is Success
according to you,
If you ask me
i have no clue!
Some say, Success is how high you bounce
when you hit the bottom,
But the real meaning is
only understood by some.
What is success
with which everyone is so obsessed
Getting promotion in a job?
which will make you further slog!
Earning umpteen money?
that does not long last as its only a penny!
Buying a new phone or a car?
does it take you very far!
Scoring good marks in examinations?
long way to go though will temporarily ease your tension!
If you ask me honestly
One thing I can say instantly is
Success comes from happiness,
When you are a reason for someone's smile and cheerfulness
You have people caring for you, waiting for you
You are thought about and loved though by selected trustworthy few
You have a splendid time with your loved one or close buddy
You invest time in yourself and accomplish your long outstanding hobby
At the end I feel, when you have a good satisfying day
Success comes with you in your way!"
2660,Emotion,SuccessPoemsOnPerseveranceForSuccessPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"Who says that things cannot be done?
Nothing’s impossible on earth;
Most things are possible under the sun;
But perseverance should be thine friend!
The one who gives up with ease is a fool!
The wise person labors with determination;
Yet, one must choose the things that one can do,
And go full steam ahead, till comes success.
Perseverance is the secret of success;
By continual toil, failures can be avoided;
Great things were done by burning mid-night’s oil!
“The toiler harvests best of fruits in life.”"

Sprouts ambition to the sky
To bloom into a smile high.
Happiness across to fly,
Its fluttering wings in flight
Spreads across the field its light.
Blossomed is success glass-bright
With glory mounting in sight.
Heart content is in sublime,
Remains diamond-worth in prime.
Victory does reign in clime,
Hailing joy bell-like to chime."

2663,Emotion,SuccessPoemsASuccessStoryPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"Each and every one has got success story
You will be excited with news and others may feel sorry
Some one has to take the credit for it and enjoy
There may other factors too leading for the joy
It is culmination of hard efforts that makes it possible
It would have remained in dream and nearly impossible
Had there been no initiative of any sort in this regard?
It would have never been materialized even if worked very hard
It involves application of mind with strong resolve
No room is left and made sure that everybody is involved
It has to be joint effort with sincerity and dedication
It is first step toward success and is apparent indication
Success lies beneath the popular support
if you maintain contacts with good rapport
it will be great encouragement and contributing to strength
if maintained on same level with good wavelength
what amounts to failure or leading to success?
When you gain entry  to have full access
You go with relentless efforts coupled with zeal
it ends in good finish with final seal
it makes impact with great difference
If you fail to draw correct inference
You must heed and pay attention to an expert advice
When something goes wrong or fails as device
Things move on  with saying “United we stand and divided we fall”
If you do not wake up and respond to a call
You can swim against opposing current and rising waves
With resolute action and waves might pave
People will be frustrated with your success and annoyed
If message is not understood by them and properly conveyed
Close your hand and it strong with grip strength
People will understand clearly at good length
Youngsters may have to sacrifice and die
Not to give any way or simply tell lies
It is need of an hour and they must rise to the occasion
Not to take any chance or wait for  battle of succession
More you work in peace than less you may bleed
Success may touch your feet and you may succeed
Why not ride on high waves and shout for peace?
Life may not be normal and you may feel at ease
It is in fact two sides of the coin
One may be entering and other may be going
There may not be any joy if one them is missing
People may laugh at you and start teasing"

Meant wealth and power I must stress,
An easy life, with all lifes pleasures,
A mansion high, with worldly treasures,
Tours abroad to places new,
While in some bank my money grew,
Some people yes, tis aim they try,
Yet still a dream for you and I .
Late in life I thought again,
Together still through joys and pain,
Yes, we are wed through all those years
Sharing troubled times and tears,
Our money spent on all our plans,
Yet still so happy, holding hands,
Our children grown, as we grew old,
Your love for me worth more than gold
This love we share, I now caress,
I feel the secret of success."

I do not recognize success and
I do not care failure
I know success is not necessary
To lead a good life
I know I like what I do
And who am I to do
I am nobody to do anything and
Success has no meaning for me."
2670,Emotion,SuccessPoemsSonnetSuccessWillComePoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"Don't lose your heart if failures come with ease;
Build up courage and try again-succeed;
Let failures not disturb your mental peace;
Delayed if mirth is sure to well exceed.
Rewards may come to some in ways unknown;
Rewards may miss the truly talented;
Rewards may make a person sometimes clown;
All flowers aren't born to be well-scented.
Though failures come, our duty we must do;
Let Nature take its time and course it must;
Results could be very untoward too;
Our human eyes cannot avoid road-dust.
The patient man will soon succeed in life;
But one knows not, how long can last one's strife."
2671,Emotion,SuccessPoemsSuccessPoembyEmmaLazarus,"Oft have I brooded on defeat and pain,
The pathos of the stupid, stumbling throng.
These I ignore to-day and only long
To pour my soul forth in one trumpet strain,
One clear, grief-shattering, triumphant song,
For all the victories of man's high endeavor,
Palm-bearing, laurel deeds that live forever,
The splendor clothing him whose will is strong.
Hast thou beheld the deep, glad eyes of one
Who has persisted and achieved? Rejoice!
On naught diviner shines the all-seeing sun.
Salute him with free heart and choral voice,
'Midst flippant, feeble crowds of spectres wan,
The bold, significant, successful man."
2672,Emotion,SuccessPoemsASearchForSuccessPoembyRajaramRamachandran,"He was on the same spot,
Holding a small pot,
Ran his family lot,
With whatever he got.
Fifty years rolled by,
But never any passerby,
Any time felt troubled by,
This beggar lived close by.
Destiny played its role,
To snatch his daily dole,
He wasn't seen one day,
Having silently passed away,
A memorial in his place,
For his act of grace,
Was proposed out of pity,
By the gentlemen of the city.
Dug under the ground,
They, by chance, found,
A mud pot, with gold
Coins of ancient old.
Their sympathy increased,
O'er the poor deceased,
For years he stood on the gold,
With his hardship untold.
Yes, only an endless search,
Can make one to touch,
And go ahead to reach
The goal of success, as such."
2673,Emotion,SuccessPoemsSuccessStoryFoMLadyErnestinePoembyivororivorehogg,"She was as timid as a mouse.
Kept firmly under mothers thumb
she very rarely left the house.
Her mother taught her she was dumb.
But mother died and she was free
to do the things she wanted to.
None to frown disapprovingly
and tell what her she had to do.
An innocent of twenty three
Although she lacked self confidence.
She was still wise enough to be
well guided by her common sense.
She knew that she must take it slow.
There was so much she had to learn,
so many things she did not know.
Each hurdle she would take in turn.
She was resolved to seek advice
but was not sure where she would find
Although she could afford the price,
Advice that was both wise and kind.
Her mother’s sister Aunty Jean
was who she took her troubles to
A lady who had always been
disapproved of by mother too.
So Aunty Jean took her in hand
and showed her how she ought to dress.,
Wise enough to understand
that her young niece felt helpless.
A lifetime under Mothers thumb
had left its mark indelibly,
A problem she must overcome
before she was completely free.
to be the woman she should be
They worked together as a team
moving forward very slowly
But in due course fulfilled her dream.
Now with her new found confidence.
She was a woman self possessed,
well made up and smartly dressed.
Her mother’s ghost now laid to rest.
Freed from her mothers influence.
No longer dowdy and afraid.
Epitome of elegance
She was a model highly paid.
Though mother would have disapproved
well armoured in her prudishness
that she was wrong her daughter proved
By her own efforts a success.
Mothers do not always know best
Although they always think they do
I think this mother failed the test
She knew less than she thought she knew.

2674,Emotion,SuccessPoemsASongOfSuccessPoembyRobertWilliamService,"Ho! we were strong, we were swift, we were brave.
Youth was a challenge, and Life was a fight.
All that was best in us gladly we gave,
Sprang from the rally, and leapt for the height.
Smiling is Love in a foam of Spring flowers:
Harden our hearts to him -- on let us press!
Oh, what a triumph and pride shall be ours!
See where it beacons, the star of success!
Cares seem to crowd on us -- so much to do;
New fields to conquer, and time's on the wing.
Grey hairs are showing, a wrinkle or two;
Somehow our footstep is losing its spring.
Pleasure's forsaken us, Love ceased to smile;
Youth has been funeralled; Age travels fast.
Sometimes we wonder: is it worth while?
There! we have gained to the summit at last.
Aye, we have triumphed! Now must we haste,
Revel in victory . . . why! what is wrong?
Life's choicest vintage is flat to the taste --
Are we too late? Have we laboured too long?
Wealth, power, fame we hold . . . ah! but the truth:
Would we not give this vain glory of ours
For one mad, glad year of glorious youth,
Life in the Springtide, and Love in the flowers."
2675,Emotion,SuccessPoemsCompleteSuccessPoembyGajananMishra,"Complete success
The words themselves
Contradict
Secluded.

Repetitions of

2676,Emotion,SuccessPoemsSuccessAndSuccessPoembyAbdulWahab,"Every ripple does not make a wave
Each wave does not reach the shore
Yet they are made and kept sending
The reason we are taught
Life is like an ocean
And our endeavours are like ripples
We should keep making them
Few of them will create a poem like waves
And sometimes make you float up on the shore of success."

Of one who died of growing pains."
2679,Emotion,SuccessPoemsSecretOfMySuccessPoembyDavidHarris,"The secret of my success
is that I’m as crazy as a coot.
I am so full of silliness
my wife often denies she is with me.
When I get dressed for parties
and someone is giving me a lift
they shove me in the backseat
telling me to duck down
as far as I can get
as they do not want to be seen
with a crazy man in their car.
My answer to all this,
is that we need a few crazy people
who are just like me,
to bring a smile around,
stop everyone getting bored.
My motto is quite simple
a smile a day
keeps the miseries at bay;
a laugh is a dropp of sunshine
to those who wear a frown.
Maybe I should have a craziness day
so everyone can join in
and have as our trademark
a big lop-sided GRIN."
2680,Emotion,SuccessPoemsSuccessPoembyMarvinBratoSr,"Man dreams....
for an achievement in life,
a real accomplishment to be proud of
like attaining victory
in most if not all quests
to triumph in a contest
and hit the goal
as a winner
with great sensation!"
2681,Emotion,SuccessPoemsSuccessIsNotHappinessHappinessIsSuccessPoembyAiRAtmaninRavi,"If Success was Happiness
Then achievers would be glad
But look around and you will find
That many of them are sad
Of course, Achievement gives joy
And excitement, oh boy!
But when our need becomes our greed
To misery, this will lead
The whole world is chasing Success
Everyone wants achievement
Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose
There is no Contentment
Why do people want to succeed?
Why is everyone in a race?
The Truth is that we want to win
So that there is a smile on our face
But though we win, we are not glad
We have money, why are we sad?
Happiness is not money, the sages said
It's sleeping soundly when you are in bed
We hear of suicides in the homes of the rich
If they were Happy, then why this glitch?
Although they are achievers, this fact we know
They are not Happy, their face has no glow
If successful, but unhappy, what is the use?
Winning or smiling, what would you choose?
The purpose of Success is for us to be glad
What is the use of winning, if it makes us sad?
Happiness is something different, we learn
Not just money that we earn and burn
Happiness is built on a foundation of peace
Then we are blissful like waves in the seas
Look around at the people who are glad
They live in the moment, they are never sad
They don't swing from the future to the past
They are the ones whose Happiness lasts
Happiness has no price tag, know this my friend
It's a state of mind where nothing can offend
It's being able to smile, and able to laugh
Not just trying to raise our Success graph
We can't measure joy in dollar and pound
Happy is he who peace has found
Though we may fly the world around
We may be miserable on the ground
Success is not Happiness, this Truth we must know
We may have everything, what's the use of this show?
The truly successful one is he
Who lives with smile, laughter, and glee
If one is Happy, then one has achieved all
One doesn't have to be rich and in fame be tall
One can have little, but if content is he
Then he can live joyously
Achievement gives Happiness, this fact we know
But with Fulfilment and Contentment, does Happiness grow
One who is Happy, doesn't need to win
He has Peace and Joy without committing sin
Joy doesn't need a foundation of cash
One doesn't have to be rich, to enjoy life's bash
Happiness is a simple state of the mind
It comes from being loving, it comes from being Kind
Happiness is Success. It is achieving life's goal
It is being Happy in the heart, Peaceful in the Soul
True Happiness is eternal, not just a moment of joy
It last's forever, it can't be destroyed
Success is a journey of valleys and peaks
Life is a see-saw, there arelaughs and squeaks
Success, unlike Happiness, doesn't last for long
But the truly Happy ones always sing a Happy song
So, Success is not Happiness, Happiness is Success
You may be an achiever, whose heart is not at rest
But though not successful, if Happy you are
Then you are an achiever, you are the very best"
2682,Emotion,SuccessPoemsFailureAndSuccessPoembySusanTAparejo,"Such irresistible twins,
Shadowing  each other,
One can't make it,
Others can't do it.
Holding hands together,
Far and wide to the ocean,
seas, rives and waterfalls,
to the greatest heights,
and profound deep,
both of them following the other.
Failure first then comes success,
Success first then comes failure,
Both of them give way to the other,
For they know so well,
either one can live freely,
For they are both
Shadows and Twins!"
2683,Emotion,SuccessPoemsTheRoadToSuccessPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"The Road to Success
We all want to walk on the road of success
But do you day by day measure your progress
Do you have a vision?
Do you have a mission?
You need one even if it is inspired by television
We all want to walk on the road of success
But do you day by day measure your progress
Critically look at your personal development
Grizzle over the final accomplishment
Decide on the instruments you need at the moment?
On its road, there are many paths to take
With many sacrifices along the way to make
Patience, faith and hard work, please don’t forsake
Or your dreams will pour empty into a wide lake
We all want to walk on the road of success
But do you day by day measure your progress
Is your vision greater than greatness?
You are the first one you must try to impress
Take a step at a time and do not digress
For success when achieved, I say without sarcasm
Is more gratifying than any orgasm

2684,Emotion,SuccessPoemsSuccessPoemsWhatWillBeYourLegacyPoembyHakiAitoro,"Do I wander through life aimlessly?
Wild, reckless, inconsiderate
Unmindful of the consequences of my behaviour
Do I run wild in a savage stupor?
Pugnacious, belligerent, impolite
Unconscious of the altitude of my ignorance
Unaware of the latitude of my negligence
Carefree
Leaving a trail of scarcity
Along a path of regret
Leaving years of psychological scars
In the repressed minds of distressed adults
In the misguided souls of troubled youths
Will I leave disillusioned children?
Angry and confused
Shameful and misguided
Lost and astray
Crying for direction
Weeping for guidance
Longing for unconditional love
Grieving for sound judgement
For I taught them not a lifetime of wisdom
For wisdom was not important
For I offered them not sound advice
For I never took life seriously
For I taught them not discipline
For I was reckless and immature
For I showed them naught but a dropp of love
For my selfishness knew no bounds
Will I leave disappointed partners?
Bitter and frustrated
Troubled and wounded
Disturbed and injured
Wishing for sincerity
Longing for honesty
Praying for fidelity
Yearning for faithfulness
For I killed their trust
Due to my shamelessness
For I eradicated their hope
Due to my disrespect
For I damaged their faith
Due to my infidelity
For I destroyed their confidence
Due to my deception
For I killed their self development
Due to my ignorance
Will I leave appalled individuals?
Disgusted and revolted
Unconcerned and apathetic
Sarcastic and scornful
Mocking my ignorance
Sickened at my negligence
Horrified at my irresponsibility
Deriding my financial intelligence
Appalled at my selfishness
For I disrespected many good folk
In the name of humour
Mere mockery in fact
For I abused much kindness
In the name of friendship
Sheer exploitation to be precise
For I never listened to others
In the name of intelligence
Simply arrogance no doubt
For I spoke ill of people
In the name wisdom
Purely foolishness indeed
For I was impatient with the most enduring
In the name of progress
Clearly mental commotion
For I was unforgiving with the most compassionate
In the name of truth
Conceitedness in fact
Fatherhood was not my forte
For I struggled to maintain my youth
Relationship was not my aspiration
For I disliked commitment
Friendship was not my goal
For I detested disagreement
Education was not my focus
For I found it a bore
Investment was not my desire
For I cherished the consumer lifestyle
Responsibility was not my wish
For I cherished excitement and folic
Discipline was not my want
For I enjoyed ease
Devotion was not my focal point
For I choose carelessness
So what will you leave?
A story of inspiration through your achievements
A fable of love through your affection
An account of devotion through your loyalty
A description of success through your diligence
A portrayal of courage through your chosen path
A depiction of wisdom through your experiences
An illustration of happiness through your humour
An image of resilience through your adversity
A report of wealth through your acumen
A tale of nobility through your actions
A myth of grandeur through your life of contribution
Let us all be remembered
For the lives we touched
For the people helped
For the wisdom we shared
For the stories we told
For the laughter we initiated
For the love we gave
For the affection we showed
For the good role models we were
For the communities we inspired
For the youth we guided
For the hungry we feed
For the needy we assisted
For the success we created
For the risk we took
For the world we changed
Let us write down our stories
Let us tell our experiences
Let us record our tales
Let us share our struggles
For our children
For our grandchildren
For generations to see
For generations to hear
As a source of hope
As a source of wisdom
As a source of guidance
As an example of our legacy
So what will you leave?"
2685,Emotion,SuccessPoemsSuccessStoryPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"Does success blind the man completely?
Not wait and go for its show immediately?
If he is earthly man then will slowly digest,
Means and ways set first and then suggest,
Only clever and seasoned will be enjoying,
All of sudden success may lead to annoying,
Way of living may bring tremendous change,
Confidence enhanced and disorderly manage,
Somebody may diversify to honouable living,
Purchase of luxurious cars and self driving, ,
Honest may prefer and turn to charity reviving,
Rest may go for sight seeing and sea diving,
It brings dramatic change in way of thinking,
Sudden urge and change some time lead to sinking,
Arrogance and power blind a person,
As sudden change you may find with season,
You look towards fellow brothers as inferior creature,
Their hello and address bite you as vulture,
You feel their company danger for future,
Ill feeling and distrust in mind nurture,
This all takes away from main stream,
Success story makes you to believe as dream,
You feel as if you had God given chance,
Forget the past and visit the club for dance,
Drink, drug and smacks are natural ally,
Money in hand doesn’t look silly,
Pushed to the dark as time go on,
No way to come back, not even soon,
It will be nightmare or bad dream,
Success may blind but not allow to scream,
You will be completely cut off from friends,
Down to earth when success story ends
Success has another story to tell,
People have learnt how to remain well,
Act as humble and good ideas sell,
Where does then bad or descend the hell"
2686,Emotion,SuccessPoemsMyStepToSuccessPoembyCharlesFarmkidzzzMthembu,"My first step to success.....
it all began when it started
i held the page upright as it was free from ink
ideas flowed like a river in summer
my mind became glimmering with thoughts
i had to begin somewhere with the right
words, i had to tickle the reader at first sight
i sat as i drowned in knowledge
scanning the words carefully since i could not afford
mistakes
my fingers took the first step
my mouth entertained the words
my brain structured the llines
the pen moved along the page
half way towards the end
the alarm awakend me
mum shouting at her best
birds tweeting outside
i rose from my bed in disappointment
it was all just a dream.......!"
2687,Emotion,SuccessPoemsSuccessInFailurePoembyGreenPeace,"Failures infinite in life
Despair-- Demoralisation--- Depression-
Hence success by mere thoughts
At least momentary happiness-- bliss--- ecstasy--
To reap the joy of the implausible
The unattained fulfilment of the feat
Which proved to be defeat
Thus success in failure.
Note: With umpteen failures in life where there's no success at all a bit of momentary happiness can be gained by thinking of it."

Not by wealth
Nor by position or fame
And not by power

Whatever that may be
Success is being
content, with God
as the center of your family

2691,Emotion,CrazyPoemsIfTheWorldWasCrazyPoembyShelSilverstein,"If the world was crazy, you know what I'd eat?
A big slice of soup and a whole quart of meat,
A lemonade sandwich, and then I might try
Some roasted ice cream or a bicycle pie,
A nice notebook salad, and underwear roast,
An omelet of hats and some crisp cardboard toast,
A thick malted milk made from pencils and daisies,
And that's what I'd eat if the world was crazy.
If the world was crazy, you know what I'd wear?
A chocolate suit and a tie of eclair,
Some marshmallow earmuffs, some licorice shoes,
And I'd read a paper of peppermint news.
I'd call the boys 'Suzy' and I'd call the girls 'Harry,'
I'd talk through my ears, and I always would carry
A paper unbrella for when it grew hazy
To keep in the rain, if the world was crazy.
If the world was crazy, you know what I'd do?
I'd walk on the ocean and swim in my shoe,
I'd fly through the ground and I'd skip through the air,
I'd run down the bathtub and bathe on the stair.
When I met somebody I'd say 'G'bye, Joe,'
And when I was leaving - then I'd say 'Hello.'
And the greatest of men would be silly and lazy
So I would be king... if the world was cazy."
2692,Emotion,CrazyPoemsALittleWordCalledCrazyPoembyDanielHooks,"A little word called crazy
Which people use when they are being lazy.
The word crazy covers a multi of goods and ills
Mad, bad, sad, cool
or even acting the fool.
It's used in our everyday language
But it's often misunderstood
But it fits into sentences so well (and so good)
Sometimes you can't seem to see the origins for this word
it sounds so absurd the way its used and abused
like crazy baby, crazy sin, a crazy outer and a crazy in!
Crazy actually means mad insane or foolish
so says the dictionary
but you can be crazy in love with someone
perhaps we are all crazy to be using this word
maybe it's so absurd that you can use it in so many ways
in everyday life.
But the English language is good like that!"

What of the places you once
longed to go or the love you

Are you filled with regret in
constant lament or are you still
trying to grow?  When you close
your eye’s at night in gentle sleep
do you still see me?"
2694,Emotion,CrazyPoemsCrazyJaneGrownOldLooksAtTheDancersPoembyWilliamButlerYeats,"I found that ivory image there
Dancing with her chosen youth,
But when he wound her coal-black hair
As though to strangle her, no scream
Or bodily movement did I dare,
Eyes under eyelids did so gleam;
Love is like the lion's tooth.
When She, and though some said she played
I said that she had danced heart's truth,
Drew a knife to strike him dead,
I could but leave him to his fate;
For no matter what is said
They had all that had their hate;
Love is like the lion's tooth.
Did he die or did she die?
Seemed to die or died they both?
God be with the times when I
Cared not a thraneen for what chanced
So that I had the limbs to try
Such a dance as there was danced -
Love is like the lion's tooth."

Snow falls
in the outside world
flake after flake
clinging for dear life
to the window pane
as it softly
erases our gazes
stuck
upon the glass
the fire
roaring behind us
with all the gusto
of past Christmases
two worlds
existing at once
separated only
by the mind
of the little boy
for whom
it was
always forever
the first time
as if the world
was being
created for him
just that second
as if God had said:
“Look…I have this
idea? ”
sketching it quickly
in white
asking: “Well, …
what do ya think? ”
And then impatiently
rubbing it out
and then
drawing it again
in snow & always
his father’s voice
singing somewhere
in the darkness

Unknown woman
lost in the darkness
of an enormous
fireplace
black hair
framing a death
pale face
her dark dress
making her almost
invisible
a singing
floating head
hands
white doves
taking flight in gesture
almost mythical
your voice
tells the tale
of CRAZY MAN MICHAEL
each breath
almost magical
as your voice
shapes his fate
& he kills his own true love
by mistake.
“For his true love
is flown
into every flower grown
& he must be keeper of the garden, ”
Unknown woman
singing in the darkness
always your voice
the tears in my eyes.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These are two beautiful songs that have stayed with me all through my life…I wouldn’t be without them.
MY LAGAN LOVE would have been first heard on the radio program SUNDAY MISCELENY again and again as an ancient air or sung by man or woman or transformed by Horslips into an electric guitar fantasia.
I loved all versions.
The favorite one being my Dad going out to get coal one childhood Chrsitmas singing a wordless version to himself…his voice hanging in the darkness as bright as any star.
A thing of beauty and my joy for ever.
CRAZY MAN MICHAEL seems like an eternally old ballad dragged back into the future but was actually written by Richard Thompson and sung by the incomparable Sandy Denny. I went to the Grapevine Arts Centre for a folk session and as I entered the door framed in this magnificent fireplace this vision sang this version from her darkness. It was as if LA BELLE DAME SANS MERCI had come alive and could sing me to death with her song.
I was stunned and in love with the song ever since!"

close to an obsession

deep down i know
you lack the courage to
tell it like it is
so instead you stare
sometimes winking
at your love slave
willing to risk nothing

then crawl back into my shell

2702,Emotion,CrazyPoemsCrazyCircusJustAWrapPoembyGomerLePoet,"Crazy Circus (just a wrap)
We’re runnin’ like chickens with our heads cut off,
Squealing like piggies round the old food trough,
Stuck on a treadmill and we can’t get off,
It’s a crazy circus
Lost and confused, walkin in a trance,
Common sense needs a second chance,
But time is runnin out gotta change our stance,
Such a crazy circus
Just lookin’ for respect we think we know
But the real truth is you reap what you sow
Under the bigtop we’re up on the stage
Spillin’ and killin’ lost in a rage
Why can’t we just turn the page
Of this crazy circus
Strutin’ our stuff actin’ real cool
Posin’ in the mirror ready for a duel
Now who do you think is the real fool
What a crazy circus
The old ringmaster we’re the main attraction
Always lookin’ for some kind of action
Spinnin’ our wheels losin’ our traction
In this crazy circus
Just lookin’ for respect we act like we know
But the real truth is you reap what you sow

2703,Emotion,CrazyPoemsCrazyCanaryYellowInMemoryOfMyMotherPoembyDónallDempsey,"Bright skin tight
a crazy canary yellow
jeans
my pride & joy
(my first Versace)
took a lot
of balls
to wear ‘em
but then
I got
‘em!
My mother hated
(with a vengeance)   them
(hated to pieces)
them
until one morning early
up with the crow of the cock
I cut them
myself to pieces
“Snick snack! ” sniggered
the scissors
(good for a laugh)
threw the shreds of the threads
up upon the roof
let an hour or so
pass
and then discovering
my own(the devil’s)   handiwork
accused her
of the dastardly deed.
Who else(I said)
wanted the jeans dead?
Who hated them
with such a passion
to do such...such
a thing.
Maybe she thought...
“I did it in my(God forgive)   sleep.”
“Although I know
I didn’t do it
it’s what I would have wanted done.”
After hours
struggling like a worm
I let her off the hook
confess it was I
that done them
(the jeans)    in.
She annoyed at the spoof
that took her in
but delighted at the demise
of those damn things.
The hearty laugh of then
the feeble smile of now
as she(here is this hospital)
tries not to die."

So sweet, so wet, the man turns delirious

Crazy for feeling this way
Thinking she's the best thing in the world
Wanting to spend the rest of my life with her

Or looking at her like shes a goddess

Crazy for constantly writing her poems
Crazy for asking her to marry me

The big box in the window
My mum is short on money again
I feel that it's a sin though
We'll go tonight,
Stand outside shops
You’re on guard
Incase of cops
I burst through the door
Elderly couple, surprise
Fall from step what a blunder
Grab the box noise like thunder
Turn to see if couples gaining
Disbelief, faces remaining
Turn handle wrong way
Fight with it until I stray
Where's my school friend lookout
Half way up the hill
Wait for me I start to shout
Couple, still at till
We ran and ran, fools us both, up hill
Regret and relief set in
My Mothers Birthday tomorrow
Regret and relief turn to sorrow
Next morning I awake
To see mum eat evidence
How could you afford such a gift?
I feel it’s far from providence
Oh if I could turn back the clock
And tell that boy 'No Way'
Or teach about a conscience
That might keep him from going astray."

Polished my eggs, and toasted the news,
I couldn't tell my left from my right,
All because you kissed me goodnight"
2709,Emotion,CrazyPoemsAreYouCrazyPoembyAlessandraLiverani,"Not have another cigarette, you surely must be jesting
It is my sense of humour that you can only be testing
You obviously don't realise that without them I cannot function
I must have them before breakfast, after dinner and after luncheon
I must have them when I'm anxious and have them when relaxed
I must have them when I'm on the phone and when I smell a rat
I must have them when I concentrate and have them when I rest
I must have them watching television and have them on a quest
I must have them in the daylight and have them when night falls
I must have them when a short time passes or even no time passing at all
I must have them when I see them or when they're out of sight
I must have them first thing in the morning and the very last thing at night
I must have them when I'm talking and have them when I'm breathing
I must have them when I'm walking and have them when I'm sneezing
Do you understand what I am trying to tell you?
I must have them

You should meet my friend
When my madness it is over

I stand there open speechless
And wondering at times
Whether it is me or she or it
Who have lost their minds
If you think i'm crazy
Then i'd ask you for a while
To put false dreams behind you
And take the time to smile
For if you think i'm crazy
Then there's only one thing left
To reassure your sanity
And always always let
The providence of madness
Strike deep inside your core
For in a mad mad mad mad world
Who could want for more?"

Your going to end up with me

You said you saw something in me
you've never wanted so bad in your life
Everyone thinks I've gone crazy
My heart tells me no, I'm not.
Your hug goodbye made me believe
Your going to fall in love with me with someday
Now that I've made my dream come true
It's only a matter of time you follow my footsteps

2715,Emotion,CrazyPoemsACrazyNightPoembyAliAdel,"One night, in the dead of night
Seven girls, one guy
Watched the torture of a girl on TV
The most disturbing, terrifying horror movie
When the film reached the end
Three girls and the guy got up and left
Way past curfew, to the park
With hopes to get scared in the dark
While the other four girls' stayed at home
Trying to figure out where to go
Something else was happening...
Shallow, low, and backstabbing
The one guy in the group stole a bottle of brandy
From my, one of the girls', kitchen pantry
Did I mention I was his girlfriend?
Having said that, you would think that would have stopped him!
They passed it around
As they sat at the playground
Got a warm, fuzzy tingle
And started to mingle
So I guess,
We'll call her 'S'
And he,
Will be called 'D'
Apparently neither were thinking of me
D licked candy off S's chest
'D' then played with S's breasts
They knew it was wrong, at least she did
But the crime was done, lied and cheated
When they got home and asked if they had fun
They glanced at each other and said 'Uh huh.'
From the guilty look in their twinkling eyes
I had a gut a feeling something wasn't right
Did they really think they would get away with this?
Sweep it under the rug? Throw a blanket over it?
Well in my book those aren't the rules
I don't play like that, you fools
As the night went on
Tears were shed
Trust was gone
Apologies made
Sincere hugs gave
The love had stayed
At least some, anyway
D never made an apology
D never kissed and made up with me
He just grinned and held his head high
He just stuck his chest to the sky
Pretending everything was just alright
Not even thinking of this crazy night
In the end, I thought long and hard
Gave him a second chance for a new start
But he never did clean up his act
So eventually I told him,
'Hit the road Jack! '"
2716,Emotion,CrazyPoemsCrazyForYouPoembyThadWilk,"Am I crazy, for feeling the way

I would pine away in just one day.
This I know is true.

Am I crazy, when this is the way
I feel?
Should I pinch myself to find out
if this feeling is really real? The
beauty of your love has my head
all in a spin. As my heart beats
mellifluously and deep for you
within.

Am I crazy, for craving your love
that's so divine?
For needing to hold you closely

2717,Emotion,CrazyPoemsWhatACrazyWorldPoembyDavidHarris,"What a crazy world we live in,
and you can say that again.
For when we open up, ours mouths
sometimes the words we say,
just come out all wrong.
A Scottish friend of my wife
went to see the Doctor
as her pregnancy was over due.
The Doctor told her
he would give it another week
and then he would have to induce her.
When she went, home
and her husband asked how it went.
What she said next must
have come as a big surprise.
The Doctor said if I haven’t had it
in another week,
he was going to seduce me.
Another friend of Vera’s
went to the Doctor one day.
He asked, have you come on your cycle?
She quickly replied,
no my husband brought me in his car.
Vera must be learning from them.
When we were engaged,
my mother gave her
a large bunch of peonies.
She went to work the next day
and told all her friends about the flowers.
She then wondered why
they were curled up with laughter.
She told them about the flowers OK,
but her tongue couldn’t get a grip on peonies
and something else came out instead.
What a crazy world we live in
and I wouldn’t change it in anyway.

Let's go insane, let's go crazy
We're only holding out for each other
We're not trying to fall in vain

Or maybe you do
I want to tell you things I shouldn't feel or that's what they say
I can bight my tongue
And hold back
The things we both feel
I want to tell you there is someone out there that really does care
I will just tell you that you are the man that makes me
A lost of words
‘Cause I know words will never be enough to give to you
You are the person that I look forward to each day,
The one that makes my day smile again even though my tears
Just to hear your voice makes my worries melt away
Your not just a man in first or second your the man.
The man of my waves and my fire
Will you be the one man to finally tame the restless storm?
Shall I kiss all my crazy immature nights’ goodbye?
Do I have to grow up drastically again?
Will I live and breathe within your eyes?
Like all my hope has desired
My heart flutters and may belong to you but only time will tell
How do I hang something up
When it's all that I know
As I see my crazy nights’ turn gray and disappearing in
The shadows of the last foot steps I take
The person I am stepping towards pulls too hard at times
Makes the brave turn weak
But maybe that’s what I need

2723,Emotion,CrazyPoemsCrazyPoembyLaxmiPrasadDevkota,"1.
Oh yes, friend! I'm crazy-
that's just the way I am.
2.
I see sounds,
I hear sights,
I taste smells,
I touch not heaven but things from the underworld,
things people do not believe exist,
whose shapes the world does not suspect.
Stones I see as flowers
lying water-smoothed by the water's edge,
rocks of tender forms
in the moonlight
when the heavenly sorceress smiles at me,
putting out leaves, softening, glistening,
throbbing, they rise up like mute maniacs,
like flowers, a kind of moon-bird's flowers.
I talk to them the way they talk to me,
a language, friend,
that can't be written or printed or spoken,
can't be understood, can't be heard.
Their language comes in ripples to the moonlit Ganges banks,
ripple by ripple-
oh yes, friend! I'm crazy-
that's just the way I am.
3.
You're clever, quick with words,
your exact equations are right forever and ever.
But in my arithmetic, take one from one-
and there's still one left.
You get along with five senses,
I with a sixth.
You have a brain, friend,
I have a heart.
A rose is just a rose to you-
to me it's Helen and Padmini.
You are forceful prose
I liquid verse.
When you freeze I melt,
When you're clear I get muddled
and then it works the other way around.
Your world is solid,
mine vapor,
yours coarse, mine subtle.
You think a stone reality;
harsh cruelty is real for you.
I try to catch a dream,
the way you grasp the rounded truth of cold, sweet coin.
I have the sharpness of the thorn,
you of gold and diamonds.
You think the hills are mute-
I call them eloquent.
Oh yes, friend!
I'm free in my inebriation-
that's just the way I am.
4.
In the cold of the month of Magh
I sat
warming to the first white heat of the star.
the world called me drifty.
When they saw me staring blankly for seven days
after I came back from the burning ghats
they said I was a spook.
When I saw the first marks of the snows of time
in a beautiful woman's hair
I wept for three days.
When the Buddha touched my soul
they said I was raving.
They called me a lunatic because I danced
when I heard the first spring cuckoo.
One dead-quite moon night
breathless I leapt to my feet,
filled with the pain of destruction.
On that occasion the fools
put me in the stocks,
One day I sang with the storm-
the wise men
sent me off to Ranchi.
Realizing that same day I myself would die
I stretched out on my bed.
A friend came along and pinched me hard
and said, Hey, madman,
your flesh isn't dead yet!
For years these things went on.
I'm crazy, friend-
that's just the way I am.
5.
I called the Navab's wine blood,
the painted whore a corpse,
and the king a pauper.
I attacked Alexander with insults,
and denounced the so-called great souls.
The lowly I have raised on the bridge of praise
to the seventh heaven.
Your learned pandit is my great fool,
your heaven my hell,
your gold my iron,
friend! Your piety my sin.
Where you see yourself as brilliant
I find you a dolt.
Your rise, friend-my decline.
That's the way our values are mixed up,
friend!
Your whole world is a hair to me.
Oh yes, friend, I'm moonstruck through and through-
moonstruck!
That's just the way I am.
6.
I see the blind man as the people's guide,
the ascetic in his cave a deserter;
those who act in the theater of lies
I see as dark buffoons.
Those who fail I find successful,
and progress only backsliding.
am I squint-eyed,
Or just crazy?
Friend, I'm crazy.
Look at the withered tongues of shameless leaders,
The dance of the whores
At breaking the backbone on the people's rights.
When the sparrow-headed newsprint spreads its black lies
In a web of falsehood
To challenge Reason-the hero in myself-
My cheeks turn red, friend,
red as molten coal.
When simple people drink dark poison with their ears
Thinking it nectar-
and right before my eyes, friend! -
then every hair on my body stands up stiff
as the Gorgon's serpent hair-
every hair on me maddened!
When I see the tiger daring to eat the deer, friend,
or the big fish the little,
then into my rotten bones there comes
the terrible strength of the soul of Dadhichi
and tries to speak, friend,
like the stormy day crashing down from heaven with the lightning.
When man regards a man
as not a man, friend,
then my teeth grind together, all thirty-two,
top and bottom jaws,
like the teeth if Bhimasena.
And then
red with rage my eyeballs rool
round and round, with one sweep
like a lashing flame
taking in this inhuman human world.
My organs leap out of theirs frames-
uproar! Uproar!
my breathing becomes a storm,
my face distorted, my brain on fire, friend!
with a fire like those that burn beneath the sea,
like the fire that devours the forests,
frenzied, friend!
as one who would swallow the wide world raw.
Oh yes, my friend,
the beautiful chakora am I,
destroyer of the ugly,
both tender and cruel,
the bird that steals the heaven's fire,
child of the tempest,
spew of the insane volcano,
terror incarnate.
Oh yes, friend,
my brain is whirling, whirling-
that's just the way I am.

2724,Emotion,CrazyPoemsCrazyThoughtsPoembyWaelKarameh,"Sometimes when the pain from your absence
Reaches in my body and heart the level ten
I don’t know what to do…
I start hallucinating, shouting, and calling your name
Even I cry silently
Without caring that this is in our eastern society
Is considered a big shame…
What should I do?
Should I call your mobile phone even if you don’t answer?
Should I go to your flat and knock on the door even if you don’t open?
Should I send you an e-mail even if you will not read?
Should I go to the pub and drink till I loose my consciousness?
Should I dance in the middle of the street and sleep all night on the beach?
Should I contact my previous girlfriend and apologize for quitting her?
Should I throw myself in the bed of the first prostitute I will meet?
How should react to all my crazy thoughts?
You know what is best to do
When the pain from your absence
Reaches in my body and heart the level ten…
Is simply to calm down
And leave the speech to my sincere mirror...

2733,Emotion,CrazyPoemsAmICrazyOrAmISanePoembyLizMunro,"Why do I feel so down and alone?
My heart is so cold and icy
like icebergs in the Atlantic
and it's frozen fingers
touch and chill me to the bone.
Am I crazy or am I sane?
Got these depressing thoughts
circling like angry sharks in my brain
Is it false or is it true?
Can I really believe what i'm told by you?
my mind is going cookcoo,
And it is all because of the stupid un-thinking things you do.

2734,Emotion,CrazyPoemsCrazyWorldPoembyVictorOsorio,"When she talks about love
Does she talk about you
When you feel alive
When you feel unseen
The world is blue
It's raining, so you walk
It's raining, so you talk
Thoughts are the walls
That close your mind down
Your heart once full of love
But shes not around
Maybe you're meant to be alone
In this crazy world
Everyone is on their own
Not everybody is happy
Yet we seem that way
Not everybody is lonely
Yet we seem that way
So when she talks about you
Does she talk about love."

Is it just me?
Or am I just crazy?
Where did I go?
That I don’t know
Alone in the darkness
Nothing but sadness
Crying dirty tears
It seems like my eyes never clear
No hope!
Nope
No faith!
Can’t take
No happiness!
Nothing but sadness
No love!
I know it’s only coming from above
No life
No life
Am I crazy?
Or is it just me?

2736,Emotion,CrazyPoemsCrazyGuyPoembyMoanaTuigamala,"Crazy was he,
As crazy as can be!
No one else was crazier than he,
No one was that crazy for me!
In his eyes was adoration,
From his lips was admiration.
But, in his heart there was LOVE!
And that was a problem never to be solved.
For he kept on coming,
While I kept on running.
He kept on trying,
While I kept on lying.
Yes, it was a problem without a solution,
But he took the risk of this situation.
To me, I salute this young man honestly,
For all the effort he's put in for me!"

Stuck in the crowd
Can’t hear a sound
Feels like I’m pushed back in the distance
Can’t come out
Do people see?
Do they believe?

I can’t help, but feeling so forgot
I put on a show, nobody knows
Where did all the people I used to love, go?
I see a face, forgot its name
But they don’t seem to recognize me, anyway

But how can you live? How can you give?
If there’s nothing you’ve got
Well I’ve got myself, and I’ve got my dreams

These scars on my arms aren't just scars.
They tell stories.
When you get in my face.
I'll make sure I will punch you.
Get too close
I'll shove you away
Break my heart
I'll just walk away.

after you knew them so well.
It's crazy how fast feelings can change,
from heaven into hell.
It's crazy how I thought I knew you,
and you changed right before my eyes.
It's crazy how I thought you were the real thing,
then you pulled on a deceiving disguise.
Forgive me please, I've been a fool.
None other than a fool for you.
Your not the person I once knew,
but I refuse to change myself for you.
I am me and that's all that matters to me.
Now how long will it take you to see,
that i'm done with all the tears I cry.
This is 'i'm sorry' for the last time."

The grandfather his was richer;
Slept clumsy on a pillow...
The Pillow  probably, not as all…
Yesterday a bear the dream has dreamt,
Thought does not take out, thought will be lost
Bees did not give something sweet
The bear became crazy - a syndrome caries
The bear has jumped out of dens …
The bear runs with a pillow,
And it is a pillow uneasy!
This the inheritance - Pandora's box...

And much said he and I.
'Those breasts are flat and fallen now,
Those veins must soon be dry;
Live in a heavenly mansion,
Not in some foul sty.'
'Fair and foul are near of kin,
And fair needs foul,' I cried.
'My friends are gone, but that's a truth
Nor grave nor bed denied,
Learned in bodily lowliness
And in the heart's pride.
'A woman can be proud and stiff
When on love intent;
But Love has pitched his mansion in
The place of excrement;
For nothing can be sole or whole
That has not been rent.'"

Frank Sinatra wants me
To use my Visa card again

Wait a minute...a simple man?
Is there any other kind?
Madonna knows which make-up
I should always use
The Beach Boys wanna send me
On a Carnival Cruise
Shania has a Chevy for me

Or buy an Apple computer
From the Black-Eyed Peas

Do they even give a hoot?

Make me gaze and gaze at you
And lost at you in merry thoughts

To adore you my blue sky
Your sight, you void, beloved plane
Make me feel floating with
Foamy white, and grey folks
Brewing out of frisky frost
I go crazy now a day
To admire you my dear stars
Twinkling with frolic comets
Make me feel jealous of you
To be there, there in glee

You only could see my love
Day and night n’ round the clock"

I promised something new
And I promised to collect it.
I promised to keep you high—
You were afraid you might fall.
I promised my words to your throne
To keep the foundation strong
I promised to write your memory,
And rewrite your thoughts.
I promised not to let you fall,
For my words keep the throne.
And after every promise delivered
We were crazier and did not believe
How easy it was to keep promises
And how easy it is to be crazy.
And after every word became a bird,
And every word became a flower,
We knew how good it is to be crazy—
And you loved my madness
Your fear had no basis.
You were comfortable
In your magnificent role.
We promised we would not stop.
We promised never to stop writing poems.
We promised to keep the words flying.
We promised to keep the throne fresh and alive.
We promised to stay crazy."

I was having a good time
Laughing and dancing
I was coming up for air
From the life of the party
Standing on the balcony
In the fresh autumn air
It seemed to penetrate my skin
Leaving me refreshed
I stepped back inside
Smiling at my many friends
I’m watching the couples
Decide and others wait
I’m pouring myself
Another absolut vodka
When it hits my lips
My personal anguish
Comes through the door
With the bearded man
On a short leash of course
It only brings back
Awful moments
What is in her face?
That is so familiar
Is her face
From another life?
I look the other way
Having out grown her
We have the same friends
Which makes awkward meets?
I shake hands
With the bearded man
Thinking what does she see in that?
Cause I’m like Brad Pitt
Compared to that
Maybe it’s the pocket
Full of coke
As she smiles at me
She sniffles a little
I hug her
And kiss her on the lips
Just so the bearded man
Gets unglued for a moment
And doubts himself
She sends her pet
For a couple of beers
My crazy beach of an ex-wife
Looks pretty hot
In the little black dress
But I’m sure
That is part of the plan
She looks me in the eyes
And says our fifteen years
Wasn’t so bad
Maybe for her, not me!
The bearded man then appears
Wearing a frown
But she jerks his leash
Making him heel
Just then, Megan my date
Rescues me with a hug
And a juicy kiss
Now the bearded man smiles
And crazy beach of an ex-wife
Is frowning
I just tip my head
Grin and pull Megan
Towards the door
Wanting to Make-Love
Not Strife anymore"

Between the dark and dawn.
A lonely ghost the ghost is

I - love's skein upon the ground,
My body in the tomb -
Shall leap into the light lost
In my mother's womb.

In an empty bed,
The skein so bound us ghost to ghost
When he turned his head
passing on the road that night,
Mine must walk when dead."

wandering the wilderness,
hearing voices.
They found me one day
saying 'I hear voices
as clearly as you hear my voice
in this room
yet no one else hears
so that makes me crazy?
The voices denigrate me.
They deny me
and what I want is for them to go away.
Yet, when they speak
they mock me
saying
'they can't hear us because we are blocking them'
and they think you are crazy- this is what makes
us strong
and you weak.'
I hear these voices
and have to drown them out
so I don't hear.
So I don't hear
So I can sleep.
What I need is someone
who believes me:
they know if someone does
their power
is gone.
Does that make me crazy?
I don't think so.."

But I’m beginning to think that maybe,
Maybe she was right.
Perhaps it’s time for you to take flight,
Leave me sitting here, cursed,
So you can be with the friend who comes first.
I defended you, said you were a friend,
But I think it’s time for those words to come to an end.
I once heard: “Love many, trust few”
I thought I trusted you, but now I see that this friendship isn’t true.
I waved to you and said “Hi, ”
Now I’m waving, but this time saying “Bye.”
Soon, I’ll cry and make a big deal,
I’ll cry, but I’ll keep this promise sealed.
Just like Taylor said, “I can’t breath without you,
But I have too.”
It’s beginning to get cold
It feels like, to you, my heart’s been sold.
I go sit on the cold ground out side,
And abide for you to choose your side.
Have you ever thought that maybe, your wrong, not me?
Perhaps that’s the key.
Now you can say you’re sorry all you want,
But know she was right again, you’re not.
You’re not Sorry."

Great-bladdered Emer sat.
Her violent man
Cuchulain sat at her side;
Thereupon'
Propped upon my two knees,
I kissed a stone
I lay stretched out in the dirt
And I cried tears down."
2767,Emotion,CrazyPoemsCrazyHopePoembyAngelicaMarkle,"I spin around with may arms stretched,
Focused on the star lit sky,
Memories of an amazing night etched,
Fresh in my optimistic mind,
Just hoping, preying nothing will go wrong,
Scared of being in my past,
For now just an actress playing right along,
I just wanna wear a mask,
To hide the terror that over takes my bravery,
What if? What if? ? What if? !
Will it happen? Or will I be sold back into slavery?
No? Then here I go off the cliff,
Yes? Then I will have 'died and gone to heaven'
I'll I can do is hope, please?
Will never believe, if ever, until exactly When,
I discover if I have a neurological disease,
Or if this is for real, and I'm not crazy."

I was looking for my eyeglasses
Thought i have to go upside down
And not to pick it up
In a normal way
but my knees just wobble
I dont wanna dilly dabble
Think i must be crazy..am i?
My  neighbors just laugh at me, he he he
Seeing me in this position
Nahh, dont mind really
I  am comfortable here  swinging down
They think  i must be crazy

2769,Emotion,CrazyPoemsCrazyJaneReprovedPoembyWilliamButlerYeats,"I care not what the sailors say:
All those dreadful thunder-stones,
All that storm that blots the day
Can but show that Heaven yawns;
Great Europa played the fool
That changed a lover for a bull.
Fol de rol, fol de rol.
To round that shell's elaborate whorl,
Adorning every secret track
With the delicate mother-of-pearl,
Made the joints of Heaven crack:
So never hang your heart upon
A roaring, ranting journeyman.
Fol de rol, fol de rol."
2770,Emotion,CrazyPoemsACrazyAndInsanePoetPoembyErshadMazumder,"When I am crazy and insane
as said by the critics
how can I be a poet.
I do not know
how to praise God
God has not taught me
the language of praise
and pleasant words.
I do not fear my God unseen
I have not learnt how to fear
gods on earth
who loves death
instead of life.
Who loves people of power
hoping for a reward.
I prefer chain and punishment
instead of flowers
How can I be a poet of honour
when I am with undressed
and unhonoured people.

He said he hate what  I do  and what i stand for, to not hit him was ruff
Why do people tend to not look from outside of the boots
I say they need to read a history book on american roots
Some of the comments I hear, I see people can be very crazy
They dont see the pride in the soldiers I fight with daily
Out here where Im at, we are all we got
Even tho we know americans back home got our back
I wish that guy could have seen the day a lil iraqi boy gave me a flower
He said thank you america for your courage and power
His english was kind of broken but I knew what he ment to say
We made it so at least that one lil boy can come back out and play
At my level we dont see saving the world
All we see is making a way for some little boy or little girl
So think twice when you approach me with somthing crazy to say
I fight for so much more than what you saw on the news today
So go have sweet dreams and sleep peaceful tonite
All will be secure, cause american soldiers will continue to fight"

2775,Emotion,CrazyPoemsCrazyJaneOnGodPoembyWilliamButlerYeats,"That lover of a night
Came when he would,
Went in the dawning light
Whether I would or no;
Men come, men go;
All things remain in God.
Banners choke the sky;
Men-at-arms tread;
Armoured horses neigh
In the narrow pass:
All things remain in God.
Before their eyes a house
That from childhood stood
Uninhabited, ruinous,
Suddenly lit up
From door to top:
All things remain in God.
I had wild Jack for a lover;
Though like a road
That men pass over
My body makes no moan
But sings on:
All things remain in God."
2776,Emotion,CrazyPoemsCrazyIAmPoembyAmandaSaveley,"Yes, I am THAT kid...
The crazy kid...
The kid who says whatever they want
Without thought to anyone
Get in my way,
I'll spit on your shoe!
There's nothing I care about when it comes to you...
Or is there?
Because behind every person there is a soul
And some of us are leaders,
And some of us are lost
Me?
I'm a lost leader!
Leading others into lost with me,
Like getting lost is the new trend
Don't know who you are?
No ambition?
That's cool.
Because that seems to be the 'in' thing these days...
Getting lost...
It's cool
Cool to be stupid, cool to be confused,
Cool to look to something outside yourself
Something else to abuse
Something to set. you. straight.
To make your head EXPLODE!
Cause that's what it's all about.
Making the next big bang
Without no one seeing it
Then crying how no one notices you
You know what you do then?
Ask for a pill
Go ahead.
Ask.
They're everywhere!
You can't stop in the street
Without a pill beneath your feet
Or a heart that doesn't beat
With a medicated meat
So desert your dreams
Let go of ambition
To become lost and crazy
Is today's only mission"

Now nothing is ever the same

As I bleed black fuel
This war game is intelligently cruel
They are nuclear bombing so graciously
the Big-Boss is withdrawing
The underdog is cheering
I tell you people that the world is ending
So get up and run all blaming
This is a chaotic and a crazy world
I conclude in cuffs and chains
As I repent, spin, and twirl
If only the authorities had some brains
The world is upside down
Why are Christians without a sound
While Islam is with a big crown
WW3 is the start of h***
As we burn constantly we all yell
Ring-a-ding I can hear a bell

The craziness flow
in my heart
Through the darkness

I'm crazy
in you"
2780,Emotion,CrazyPoemsAmICrazyPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"This is a poem that for me elaborates a little about the thought-provoking word ‘crazy’.
Blah, Blah, Blah, the Blah!
Blah, Blah, Blah, the Blah!
Stop!
They all look at me
With words spelling ‘Crazy’
Stop! Stop! Stop! Am I crazy?
I forever rant my thoughts to my daisy,
She stands in a vase all day playing lazy
Stop! Does this make me crazy?
Blah, Blah, Blah, the Blah!
Blah, Blah, Blah, the Blah!
An adult who still sleeps fondly with a doll
Is usually described ‘a screwball’
Stop! So am I crazy?
So what is crazy?
Talking to yourself alone on the day bus
Walking the street naked without a just cause
Sleeping under your bed daily without giving a toss
Speaking to the mirror, stating you are the boss
shitting in public, wondering why they are making such a fuss
Walking and talking like a man, instead of a lady
This poem is crazy
Stop! So am I crazy?
Blah, Blah, Blah, the Blah!
Blah, Blah, Blah, the Blah!
Ranting away in my new mental home
Doctors have labeled me half-baked
Simply because of a normal mistake
I stopped acting normal
First lost all my pals, labeling me ‘Animal’
When I’m only a meat and fish cannibal
I'm accused of being mentally deranged
Because I shouted in the supermarket
as I was dollar short-changed
They say I’m mentally unstable
Pump me up daily with drugs
While tied to the bed with crazy cables
Now who is the vicious thug?
But my thoughts are still perfectly capable
Of comprehending the new meaning of crazy
What is normal?
What is crazy?
How are we so damn sure, normal is not crazy?
Blah, Blah, Blah, the Blah!
Blah, Blah, Blah, the Blah!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Am I crazy?"
2781,Emotion,CrazyPoemsCrazyJaneAndTheBishopPoembyWilliamButlerYeats,"Bring me to the blasted oak
That I, midnight upon the stroke,
(All find safety in the tomb.)
May call down curses on his head
Because of my dear Jack that's dead.
Coxcomb was the least he said:
The solid man and the coxcomb.
Nor was he Bishop when his ban
Banished Jack the Journeyman,
(All find safety in the tomb.)
Nor so much as parish priest,
Yet he, an old book in his fist,
Cried that we lived like beast and beast:
The solid man and the coxcomb.
The Bishop has a skin, God knows,
Wrinkled like the foot of a goose,
(All find safety in the tomb.)
Nor can he hide in holy black
The heron's hunch upon his back,
But a birch-tree stood my Jack:
The solid man and the coxcomb.
Jack had my virginity,
And bids me to the oak, for he
(all find safety in the tomb.)
Wanders out into the night
And there is shelter under it,
But should that other come, I spit:
The solid man and the coxcomb."
2782,Emotion,CrazyPoemsIAmNotCrazyPoembyKyleeBartz,"So what if I see things?
These hallucinations as you call them,
How are they a big deal?
Maybe it is for real.
And I might be right this time.
Maybe, this is actually happening.
I hope these talking ducks will let me out.
I don't like these ducks.
They wear ugly white coats.
And they try to find out what is wrong with me.
Maybe the world will end today.
Or tomorrow.
And Maybe you will all see that I am not crazy.
I swear I was abducted by aliens the other day.
They had little orange polka-dots.
And they tried to eat my brain.
Maybe I will find a way out of this asylum.
Then I can live a normal life.
A life without any ducks in white coats.
Because I am not insane,
I do not have mental problems,
I have not lost my mind.
So what if i am weird sometimes?
Aren't we all weird,
Inside somewhere?
I might even be more weird than most people are.
But I can assure you,
I am not the least bit crazy!
I am not crazy.
Especially when I am writing.
I get lost in my own world.
A world where everybody is as unique as I am.
So maybe I do imagine things.
Like getting turned into a rhinoceros.
Or flying in the sky.
But am I all that crazy?
No. I am not.
Why not have a little bit of fun?
After all, we are flowers.
How quickly we can fade away.
And eventually, all of our perkiness is gone.
This is true for everybody.
So really, I assure you,
I am perfectly sane.
But I have one question.
When can I leave this asylum?"
2783,Emotion,CrazyPoemsCrazyEyesPoembyLesleyMerrin,"I wrote this poem when a girl at my school got beaten up by other girls after daring to go for a night out to another village near her own.
I left the house looking for fun
My mum shouted out 'Don't be long.'
I'd suffered before,
Echoes in my head:
'You don't belong! ! you don't belong.! ! '
Love and Hate, do they equate?
I sat on the form, doing the norm:
drinking cider and beer,
unleashing the fear.
Love and Hate, Love and Hate.
Then they arrived, full of pride,
Crazy eyes,
Chanting ' You don't belong! ! you don't belong! ! '
I tried to negate,
I could taste their hate.
'You don't belong, you don't belong.'
The boots went in,
Head started to spin,
'You don't belong, you don't belong.'
When I awoke  mum was there,
Full of despair,
All she said  'I told you don't be long.'
Love and Hate, do they equate?
'Don't be long.' 'You Don't belong.'"

2785,Emotion,CrazyPoemsReportToCrazyHorsePoembyWilliamStafford,"All the Sioux were defeated. Our clan
got poor, but a few got richer.
They fought two wars. I did not
take part. No one remembers your vision
or even your real name. Now
the children go to town and like
loud music. I married a Christian.
Crazy Horse, it is not fair
to hide a new vision from you.
In our schools we are learning
to take aim when we talk, and we have
found out our enemies. They shift when
words do; they even change and hide
in every person. A teacher here says
hurt or scorned people are places
where real enemies hide. He says
we should not hurt or scorn anyone,
but help them. And I will tell you
in a brave way, the way Crazy Horse
talked: that teacher is right.
I will tell you a strange thing:
at the rodeo, close to the grandstand,
I saw a farm lady scared by a blown
piece of paper; and at that place
horses and policemen were no longer
frightening, but suffering faces were,
and the hunched-over backs of the old.
Crazy Horse, tell me if I am right:
these are the things we thought we were
doing something about.
In your life you saw many strange things,
and I will tell you another: now I salute
the white man's flag. But when I salute
I hold my hand alertly on the heartbeat
and remember all of us and how we depend
on a steady pulse together. There are those
who salute because they fear other flags
or mean to use ours to chase them:
I must not allow my part of saluting
to mean this. All of our promises,
our generous sayings to each other, our
honorable intentions—those I affirm
when I salute. At these times it is like
shutting my eyes and joining a religious
colony at prayer in the gray dawn
in the deep aisles of a church.
Now I have told you about new times.
Yes, I know others will report
different things. They have been caught
by weak ways. I tell you straight
the way it is now, and it is our way,
the way we were trying to find.
The chokecherries along our valley
still bear a bright fruit. There is good
pottery clay north of here. I remember
our old places. When I pass the Musselshell
I run my hand along those old grooves in the rock."

At the Matinee, or singing in the choir
Everywhere a dazzling blaze of beauty
Blinds my eyes and sets my soul afire
How my heart thumps and how my head whirls!
Don't you look this way, beautiful girls!
Oh, take them away, they'll drive me crazy!
Oh! the saucy, pretty, winnning, witty, mischief-loving girls!
How my heart thumps and how my head whirls!
Don't you look this way, beautiful girls!
Oh, take them away, they'll drive me crazy!
Oh! the saucy, pretty, winnning, witty, mischief-loving girls!
As I sit beside them, charming creatures,
Little do they know how I tempted to
Throw my arms around their necks, and kiss them!
Though, of course, I know it wouldn't do.
Gliding through the gateway, there they go! there they go!
Don't they make you think of broken string of pearls?
Tripping up the stairway, here they come! here they come!
While the zephyrs frolic in their curls.
Every day so near, and yet so distant--
Everywhere so plenty, yet so little mine--
Doubtless they are angels wrongly labelled,
Angels made in other spheres to shine."
2787,Emotion,CrazyPoemsIHadToBeCrazyPoembyChocolateBunny,"I believed you, every word you said
I believed, how stupid I must have been
Didn't my mother tell me that guys always lie
I didn't want to believe it, especially looking into your eyes
the most honest face, who wouldn't trust you
your were like every girls dream come true
We had the makings of something great
but believing in you was just another mistake
I knew it somehow, even in all my doubt
that the guy I knew had not really come out
you were just another guy who lies to get what they want
luckily for me, I woke up
just in time, to correct my mistake
before I made a decision that would make it too late
I could have changed my life for you
rearranged it all

You played with me like the other's, your just about the same
But I'm thankful to you because now I know the game"
2788,Emotion,CrazyPoemsCrazyCrazyEnglishPoembyROOPREKHABHASKAR,"Explaining language rules to a five year old,
Can certainly be brain hacking.
I tried and cajoled,
But it only got more whacking.
I got real exasperated;
And Joan, more aggravated.
Why ‘Hand’ is singular, plural ‘Hands’
So are Trains, Cars and Trams.
But why Joan’s pretty Foot
Is not ‘Foots’ but Feet?
I’m vexed to answer why-
When I purchase, I Buy.
When tears roll, I cry.
But it is still incorrect;
If  ‘Buies’  appear in a sentence;
But ‘Cries’ is correct in presence.
Anne’s dog barks and she can hear it loud and clear;
But the tree barks, is not the same to hear.
‘Bite’ is a verb and so is a ‘bark’
So here is a new saying for Bill Gates dog.
“His bark is worse than his Byte! ’
But I cannot voice why, to a learner;
The day is cold, wet, or hot.
What a hot sun! ! Is never taught!
Nor the snow is cold, or the rain is wet.
You can get into a fit, and is totally silly.
‘Cause it is true in a Simile.
Ann spelt   S-I-G-H; She wrote  C-L-O-N-E
But went through a storm
Explaining the norm
Cyclone is not Sighclone.
The phone is an instrument
An electronic one as that.
Then should I write a ‘Pre’ or a ‘Post’
To reschedule my plans?
Goose is to Gander, Berry is to fruit.
Gooseberry now, has a gender issue?
And so it can be true
To say Bananaberry and Grapeberry,
Because they are berries too.

“Did you see a Mango on a Coconut tree! ? ”
Yes of course! She said with glee.

As if a lion wrestling with its prey
I sleep poetry
I dream poetry
I walk poetry on thin line ropes
binding together steeply slopes
I make love to poetry like a new catch
On heat waiting to be let loose from its latch
So out of ten if I am bad, take a pen
And give me a score of five or a four
I constantly make love to poetry
With dramatic grammatical metaphors
The root of my poetic hunger
Is I starve myself a bit longer
In sleep I twiddle my poetic lines
Sharpen them to be as fine as a riddle
I sleep poetry
I drink poetry
Not just to quench my thirst
But to differentiate amongst
Good, Better and Best
There shall come the day
I have to say
When I will definitely call it a truce
When I have run out of poetic juice

Brother to Death, sweetly thyself dispose
On this afflicted prince; fall like a cloud
In gentle showers; give nothing that is loud
Or painful to his slumbers; easy, sweet,
And as a purling stream, thou son of Night,
Pass by his troubled senses; sing his pain,
Like hollow murmuring wind or silver rain;
Into this prince gently, oh gently slide,
And kiss him into slumbers like a bride."

No joy for thee--but thou shalt find
Thy rest
All day I could not work for woe,
I could not work nor rest;
The trouble drove me to and fro,
Like a leaf on the storm's breast.
Night came and saw my sorrow cease;
Sleep in the chamber stole;
Peace crept about my limbs, and peace
Fell on my stormy soul.
And now I think of only this,--
How I again may woo
The gentle sleep-- who promises
That death is gentle too."

2795,Emotion,SleepPoemsTheSleepOfReasonPoembyVaunMoore,"It has been so long since I've watched you sleeping;
Watched the blue night descend on your body like a thick blanket.
Sometimes, your hair would cast itself like a net,
Snaring your face in fragile, moth-like tendrils.
Othertimes, your mouth would split open like overripe plums
Spilling their flesh on hot, black earth
Shattering the pregnant silence,
And beckoning the dawn.
I watch you in that silence of mine
That you know so well
Envying you
Your vulnerability,
Your abandon,
Your humanness-
Outside the window,
A Don Quixote dawn gallops mercilessly
Along the eastern edges of sky,
And you,
Like the night,
Slowly recede into memory."

Don't stay in the cricket field.

And ask for a glass of water
They won't give you.
Even the woman for whose ward
You collapsed to death.
Sleep gently, sleep,
Don't awake until I call you.
The blunt faced devils are there
Ready to give you hemlock.
They killed you, they pushed you
To the darkest domain.
Yet, you are pure, gentle, lovable.
Which dream did you dream
When you were leaving this world?
The chuckle and the half-closed eye,
Your words, voice haunt me always.
Be there near the forest of love
Unless get you.
Or sleep dear sleep until I call you!"
2797,Emotion,SleepPoemsIFellowedSleepPoembyDylanThomas,"I fellowed sleep who kissed me in the brain,
Let fall the tear of time; the sleeper's eye,
Shifting to light, turned on me like a moon.
So, planning-heeled, I flew along my man
And dropped on dreaming and the upward sky.
I fled the earth and, naked, climbed the weather,
Reaching a second ground far from the stars;
And there we wept I and a ghostly other,
My mothers-eyed, upon the tops of trees;
I fled that ground as lightly as a feather.
'My fathers' globe knocks on its nave and sings.'
'This that we tread was, too, your father's land.'
'But this we tread bears the angelic gangs
Sweet are their fathered faces in their wings.'
'These are but dreaming men. Breathe, and they fade.'
Faded my elbow ghost, the mothers-eyed,
As, blowing on the angels, I was lost
On that cloud coast to each grave-grabbing shade;
I blew the dreaming fellows to their bed
Where still they sleep unknowing of their ghost.
Then all the matter of the living air
Raised up a voice, and, climbing on the words,
I spelt my vision with a hand and hair,
How light the sleeping on this soily star,
How deep the waking in the worlded clouds.
There grows the hours' ladder to the sun,
Each rung a love or losing to the last,
The inches monkeyed by the blood of man.
And old, mad man still climbing in his ghost,
My fathers' ghost is climbing in the rain."

Relax my little one, feel the gentle breeze,
Do not worry about tomorrow, do not weep,
Wake up fresh in the morn with a recuperated mind,
Fresh and blessed with a wonderful sleep,
SLEEP, SLEEP, SLEEP!

2799,Emotion,SleepPoemsHelpMeSleepPoembyEstherLeclerc,"Sweet, warm dark of night
pull me in and hold me tight.
Help me fight this awful scourge
of sleeplessness, and the urge
to give up, get out bed,
to live the life of one Dead.
My mind and mouth are disconnected
as is my soul, it seems infected
with some loopy, crazened curse
from which I cannot wrangle verse
of any meaning or consequence,
much less poetic 'brilliance'...
Sing-song, sing-song - that manic rhythm
drives my brain, my hand, my very innards.
In fact, this morning I awoke
with these first lines like a choke-
hold on my mind - after just four hours
of nothing like sleep, too weak to shower.
At least I rested, this much is true;
my eyes no more bear reddish hue.
Still, I'm not sure which foot is right
and which is wrong, if it's day or if it's night.
Did I just put the cat in the sink -
the dishes out the door, I think?
(But I don't own a cat, so how -?
No, I won't worry about that now...)
My life's a shambles, the house in ruins,
I cannot count from one to two!
Sweet relief, where have you gone? ...
Please hold me, Sleep, sing me a song,
a lullaby of soothing rhyme
to save me from committing crime.
(2.20.06)"
2800,Emotion,SleepPoemsSonnetXxxixComeSleepPoembySirPhilipSidney,"Come Sleep! O Sleep, the certain knot of peace,
The baiting-place of wit, the balm of woe,
The poor man's wealth, the prisoner's release,
Th' indifferent judge between the high and low.
With shield of proof shield me from out the prease
Of those fierce darts despair at me doth throw:
O make in me those civil wars to cease;
I will good tribute pay, if thou do so.
Take thou of me smooth pillows, sweetest bed,
A chamber deaf to noise and blind to light,
A rosy garland and a weary head:
And if these things, as being thine by right,
Move not thy heavy grace, thou shalt in me,
Livelier than elsewhere, Stella's image see."
2801,Emotion,SleepPoemsSleepToDreamPoembyVictorOsorio,"Time to rest our eyes
We visit imagination
Best vacation of mind
Hidden desires, lost memories
Hopeful prayers aren't blind
Stand up and speak clear
When in real time-we sleep
Viewing is on the clock
More thoughts to keep
Time to rest in hours
Dreaming in peace
Sleeping in peace
Fear isn't common
Occuring once a blue
Control your eyes
Wake up for two
This is a test
Prepare for life
Dream to make
Sleep to dream."

2803,Emotion,SleepPoemsOdeToSleepPoembyThomasWartonJr,"On this my pensive pillow, gentle Sleep!
Descend, in all thy downy plumage drest:
Wipe with thy wing these eyes that wake to weep,
And place thy crown of poppies on my breast.
O steep my senses in oblivion's balm,
And sooth my throbbing pulse with lenient hand;
This tempest of my boiling blood becalm!
Despair grows mild at thy supreme command.
Yet ah! in vain, familiar with the gloom,
And sadly toiling through the tedious night,
I seek sweet slumber, while that virgin bloom,
For ever hovering, haunts my wretched sight.
Nor would the dawning day my sorrows charm:
Black midnight and the blaze of noon alike
To me appear, while with uplifted arm
Death stands prepar'd, but still delays, to strike."

in places far away,
and  love for me to keep

Lull me with your content,
Keep me ever safe my

Sleep oh blessed sleep,
Let me emerge at morn,
With clearer thought and mind,
with no more need to weep"
2805,Emotion,SleepPoemsFragmentOfASleepSongPoembySydneyThompsonDobell,"SISTER Simplicitie,
Sing, sing a song to me,
Sing me to sleep.
Some legend low and long,
Slow as the summer song
Of the dull Deep.
Some legend long and low,
Whose equal ebb and flow
To and fro creep
On the dim marge of gray
’Tween the soul’s night and day,
Washing “awake” away
Into “asleep.”
Some legend low and long,
Never so weak or strong
As to let go
While it can hold this heart
Withouten sigh or smart,
Or as to hold this heart
When it sighs “No.”
Some long low swaying song,
As the sway’d shadow long
Sways to and fro
Where, thro’ the crowing cocks,
And by the swinging clocks,
Some weary mother rocks
Some weary woe.
Sing up and down to me
Like a dream-boat at sea,
So, and still so,
Float through the “then” and “when,”
Rising from when to then,
Sinking from then to when
While the waves go.
Low and high, high and low,
Now and then, then and now,
Mow, now;
And when the now is then, and when the then is now,
And when the low is high, and when the high is low,
Low, low;
Let me float, let the boat
Go, go;
Let me glide, let me slide
Slow, slow;
Gliding boat, sliding boat,
Slow, slow;
Glide away, slide away
So, so."
2806,Emotion,SleepPoemsTearsInSleepPoembyLouiseBogan,"All night the cocks crew, under a moon like day,
And I, in the cage of sleep, on a stranger's breast,
Shed tears, like a task not to be put away---
In the false light, false grief in my happy bed,
A labor of tears, set against joy's undoing.
I would not wake at your word, I had tears to say.
I clung to the bars of the dream and they were said,
And pain's derisive hand had given me rest
From the night giving off flames, and the dark renewing."
2807,Emotion,SleepPoemsLetHerSleepPoembySubbaramanNV,"Her happy world
A lovely mould
For a scream she gets her food
For another she gets all the good
Cute toys all around
She gets sleep abound
Sleeps as she loves
Screams as she likes!
World of love, world of joy
Till it becomes a broken toy
Let her sleep undisturbed
Lest on age can't be unperturbed!
She may not be spared
Of
Pleasure of love
Pain of its failure
Evil of dowry
Pangs of treachery
Spasm of sexism
Childhood marriage
Agony of miscarriage
Early widowhood
Cruelty of poverty
Vulturous eyes
Casting evil sight
At her long curly hair
And handsome features
Making her a helpless creature!
Let her sleep undisturbed
Amidst her toys duly clutched!
Before she blossoms
Let us hasten
A world order
That Respects women
Extols her virtues
Encourages equality
Ennobles the society!"
2808,Emotion,SleepPoemsSleepIsSupposedToBePoembyEmilyDickinson,"13
Sleep is supposed to be
By souls of sanity
The shutting of the eye.
Sleep is the station grand
Down which, on either hand
The hosts of witness stand!
Morn is supposed to be
By people of degree
The breaking of the Day.
Morning has not occurred!
That shall Aurora be—
East of Eternity—
One with the banner gay—
One in the red array—
That is the break of Day!"
2809,Emotion,SleepPoemsWhileTheFatesSleepPoembyLucyMaudMontgomery,"Come, let us to the sunways of the west,
Hasten, while crystal dews the rose-cups fill,
Let us dream dreams again in our blithe quest
O'er whispering wold and hill.
Castles of air yon wimpling valleys keep
Where milk-white mist steals from the purpling sea,
They shall be ours in the moon's wizardry,
While the fates, wearied, sleep.
The viewless spirit of the wind will sing
In the soft starshine by the reedy mere,
The elfin harps of hemlock boughs will ring
Fitfully far and near;
The fields will yield their trove of spice and musk,
And balsam from the glens of pine will fall,
Till twilight weaves its tangled shadows all
In one dim web of dusk.
Let us put tears and memories away,
While the fates sleep time stops for revelry;
Let us look, speak, and kiss as if no day
Has been or yet will be;
Let us make friends with laughter 'neath the moon,
With music on the immemorial shore,
Yea, let us dance as lovers danced of yore­
The fates will waken soon!"
2810,Emotion,SleepPoemsSongOhGoToSleepPoembyJosephRodmanDrake,"Oh! go to sleep, my baby dear,
And I will hold thee on my knee;
Thy mother's in her winding sheet,
And thou art all that's left to me.
My hairs are white with grief and age,
I've borne the weight of every ill,
And I would lay me with my child,
But thou art left to love me still.
Should thy false father see thy face,
The tears would fill his cruel e'e,
But he has scorned thy mother's woe,
And he shall never look on thee:
But I will rear thee up alone,
And with me thou shalt aye remain;
For thou wilt have thy mother's smile,
And I shall see my child again."
2811,Emotion,SleepPoemsWinterSleepPoembyElinorMortonWylie,"When against earth a wooden heel
Clicks as loud as stone on steel,
When stone turns flour instead of flakes,
And frost bakes clay as fire bakes,
When the hard-bitten fields at last
Crack like iron flawed in the cast,
When the world is wicked and cross and old,
I long to be quit of the cruel cold.
Little birds like bubbles of glass
Fly to other Americas,
Birds as bright as sparkles of wine
Fly in the nite to the Argentine,
Birds of azure and flame-birds go
To the tropical Gulf of Mexico:
They chase the sun, they follow the heat,
It is sweet in their bones, O sweet, sweet, sweet!
It's not with them that I'd love to be,
But under the roots of the balsam tree.
Just as the spiniest chestnut-burr
Is lined within with the finest fur,
So the stoney-walled, snow-roofed house
Of every squirrel and mole and mouse
Is lined with thistledown, sea-gull's feather,
Velvet mullein-leaf, heaped together
With balsam and juniper, dry and curled,
Sweeter than anything else in the world.
O what a warm and darksome nest
Where the wildest things are hidden to rest!
It's there that I'd love to lie and sleep,
Soft, soft, soft, and deep, deep, deep!"
2812,Emotion,SleepPoemsLinesiCannotSleepPoembyLouisaStuartCostello,"I cannot sleep—my nights glide on
In one unbroken thought of thee;
And when the gloomy shades are gone,
I start the dawning light to see.
And as I watch the rising morn
Gain slowly o'er the yielding sky,
And mark another day new born,
That glows so brightly—yet must die—
I think how all the hopes we cherish
As transient, though as bright, will be;
And frailest of the hopes that perish
Were mine, that told of love and thee!"
2813,Emotion,SleepPoemsSleepPeacefullyPoembyAlfonsinaStorni,"You said the word that enamors
My hearing. You already forgot. Good.
Sleep peacefully. Your face should
Be serene and beautiful at all hours.
When the seductive mouth enchants
It should be fresh, your speech pleasant;
For your office as lover it's not good
That many tears come from your face.
More glorious destinies reclaim you
That were brought, between the black wells
Of the dark circles beneath your eyes,
the seer in pain.
The bottom, summit of the beautiful victims!
The foolish spade of some barbarous king
Did more harm to the world and your statue."
2814,Emotion,SleepPoemsCityThatDoesNotSleepPoembyFedericoGarcíaLorca,"In the sky there is nobody asleep. Nobody, nobody.
Nobody is asleep.
The creatures of the moon sniff and prowl about their cabins.
The living iguanas will come and bite the men who do not dream,
and the man who rushes out with his spirit broken will meet on the
street corner
the unbelievable alligator quiet beneath the tender protest of the
stars.
Nobody is asleep on earth. Nobody, nobody.
Nobody is asleep.
In a graveyard far off there is a corpse
who has moaned for three years
because of a dry countryside on his knee;
and that boy they buried this morning cried so much
it was necessary to call out the dogs to keep him quiet.
Life is not a dream. Careful! Careful! Careful!
We fall down the stairs in order to eat the moist earth
or we climb to the knife edge of the snow with the voices of the dead
dahlias.
But forgetfulness does not exist, dreams do not exist;
flesh exists. Kisses tie our mouths
in a thicket of new veins,
and whoever his pain pains will feel that pain forever
and whoever is afraid of death will carry it on his shoulders.
One day
the horses will live in the saloons
and the enraged ants
will throw themselves on the yellow skies that take refuge in the
eyes of cows.
Another day
we will watch the preserved butterflies rise from the dead
and still walking through a country of gray sponges and silent boats
we will watch our ring flash and roses spring from our tongue.
Careful! Be careful! Be careful!
The men who still have marks of the claw and the thunderstorm,
and that boy who cries because he has never heard of the invention
of the bridge,
or that dead man who possesses now only his head and a shoe,
we must carry them to the wall where the iguanas and the snakes
are waiting,
where the bear's teeth are waiting,
where the mummified hand of the boy is waiting,
and the hair of the camel stands on end with a violent blue shudder.
Nobody is sleeping in the sky. Nobody, nobody.
Nobody is sleeping.
If someone does close his eyes,
a whip, boys, a whip!
Let there be a landscape of open eyes
and bitter wounds on fire.
No one is sleeping in this world. No one, no one.
I have said it before.
No one is sleeping.
But if someone grows too much moss on his temples during the
night,
open the stage trapdoors so he can see in the moonlight
the lying goblets, and the poison, and the skull of the theaters."

And quiet to your heart -- -
Sleep on in peace now,

have someone to sit by and be with.
I would like to cradle you and softly sing,
be your companion while you sleep or wake.
I would like to be the only person
in the house who knew: the night outside was cold.
And would like to listen to you
and outside to the world and to the woods.
The clocks are striking, calling to each other,
and one can see right to the edge of time.
Outside the house a strange man is afoot
and a strange dog barks, wakened from his sleep.
Beyond that there is silence.
My eyes rest upon your face wide-open;
and they hold you gently, letting you go
when something in the dark begins to move."

why is it you elude me?
Like a crush, you tease the senses,
you taunt me with your charms.
Needing you, I'm bribed and baited,
much smitten with desire.
Your allure in awkward places
has me always hiding yawns.
You deflower me in a movie,
you corrupt me on my couch.
Should you take up prostitution,
might I gladly buy some time?
Sleep come take me lying down,
not driving in my car!
Then sighing in depravity,
again I call from bed -
Sleep, you naughty pervert,
I want you, take me now!"

Whither, unfortunate wretch, have I strayed,
Thus of thy bounty to lie disenherited -
I alone whilst every other is paid?
Sleeping are cattle and birds without number,
Beasts of the wilderness rest in their lair;
Even the hills, as if weary, feign slumber,
Even the torment sighs soft in the air.
Lulled are the shuttering waves of the ocean,
Seas in the lap of the land lie at peace.
Only for me in monotonous motion
Day follows day, and there comes no release.
Moonlight & starlight & light of the morning
Seven times flit o'er my feverish cheek.
Once again Dawn's chilly hand offers warning.
Whither, oh whither for rest shall I seek?
Had I the eyes of an Argus, nor heeded
Ever to keep my whole body awake -
Half of the sentries alone being needed -
Still I could never my slumber-thirst slake.
Yet - if there's one in the arms of a lover
Scornful of sleep and the joy that sleep brings,
Come thou to me! I'll not ask thee to cover
My eyes with the fullest extant of thy wings
Happier suitors may sue for such blessing,
I'll beg a touch, be it ever so slight,
Of thy wand, or a whisk of thy garment caressing
My eyelids to droop as it crosses the night."
2821,Emotion,SleepPoemsSleepTeasesAManPoembyDaniilIvanovichKharms,"Markov took off his boots and, with a deep breath, lay down on the divan.
He felt sleepy but, as soon as he closed his eyes, the desire for sleep immediately passed. Markov opened his eyes and stretched out his hand for a book. But sleep again came over him and, not even reaching the book, Markov lay down and once more closed his eyes. But, the moment his eyes closed, sleepiness left him again and his consciousness became so clear that Markov could solve in his head algebraical problems involving equations with two unknown quantities.
Markov was tormented for quite some time, not knowing what to do: should he sleep or should he liven himself up? Finally, exhausted and thoroughly sick of himself and his room, Markov put on his coat and hat, took his walking cane and went out on to the street. The fresh breeze calmed Makarov down, he became rather more at one with himself and felt like going back home to his room.
Upon going into his room, he experienced an agreeable bodily fatigue and felt like sleeping. But, as soon as he lay down on the divan and closed his eyes, his sleepiness instantly evaporated.
In a fury, Markov jumped up from his divan and, hatless and coatless, raced off in the direction of Tavrichesky Park."

Now the remembrance from that vision
Never fades.

These are they of thy company.
With a pathetic solicitude they attend me;
Undulant,
Their realm is the lateral courses.
Light!
I am up to follow thee, Pallas.
Up and out of their caresses.
You were gone up as a rocket,
Bending your passages from right to left and from left to right
In the flat projection of a spiral.

Wishing me well;

Of the look at first of the mortally wounded--of that indescribable
look;
Of the dead on their backs, with arms extended wide,
I dream, I dream, I dream.
Of scenes of nature, fields and mountains;
Of skies, so beauteous after a storm--and at night the moon so
unearthly bright,
Shining sweetly, shining down, where we dig the trenches and gather
the heaps,
I dream, I dream, I dream.
Long, long have they pass'd--faces and trenches and fields;
Where through the carnage I moved with a callous composure--or away
from the fallen,
Onward I sped at the time--But now of their forms at night,
I dream, I dream, I dream.                                     10"

The worshiped presence of my soul's delight.
Mine eyes are sealed, but on my clearer sight
Her heaven-bright features shine more radiantly,
Her sweet voice with a richer melody
Enchants the dark, more luminous than light.
I miss the sense of daylight's haunting ills,
Bathed in this lambent tide of sleep and love;
I only see one dazzling image beam,
Shrined in a rosy universe of dream,
Fairer than Dian bending tranced above
The sleeping shepherd on the Latmian hills."

of morning altitude
Often the awakening more

Yet sometimes the moment's sweet

Floating to billowy consciousness
this day, all soft and warm and nude
(Whoops, that last is not germane at
all, forgive me for a boob!)
Hugging pillow tightly to my
breast, the softness deep and  good...
Join me in smashing down the alarm
as we drift back to limbo's mood
Slip away to that nether region
of freefall slowed and vision skewed
Cuddle up to what you wish, my

Body and no-body, flesh and no-flesh
Not as a fugitive, blindly or bitterly,
But as a child might, with no other wish?
Yes, utterly.
Then I shall bear you down my estuary,
Carry you and ferry you to burial mysteriously,
Take you and receive you,
Consume you, engulf you,
In the huge cave, my belly, lave you
With huger waves continually.
And you shall cling and clamber there
And slumber there, in that dumb chamber,
Beat with my blood's beat, hear my heart move
Blindly in bones that ride above you,
Delve in my flesh, dissolved and bedded,
Through viewless valves embodied so –
Till daylight, the expulsion and awakening,
The riving and the driving forth,
Life with remorseless forceps beckoning –
Pangs and betrayal of harsh birth."

Forget.

By what strange ways, ah! no

Because I cease to weep,

Here by the sea in sleep,
Love sleeps."

Nor yet the blessedness of strength regained,
Alone are in what men call sleep. The past,
My unsuspected soul, my parents’ voice,
The generations of my forbears, yea,
The very will of God himself are there
And potent-working: so that many a doubt
Is wiped away at daylight, many a soil
Washed cleanlier, many a puzzle riddled plain.
Strong, silent forces push my puny self
Towards unguessed issues, and the waking man
Rises a Greatheart where a Slave lay down."
2834,Emotion,SleepPoemsSleepStealerPoembyRabindranathTagore,"Who stole sleep from baby's eyes? I must know.
Clasping her pitcher to her waist mother went to fetch water
from the village near by.
It was noon. The children's playtime was over; the ducks in
the pond were silent.
The shepherd boy lay asleep under the shadow of the banyan
tree.
The crane stood grave and still in the swamp near the mango
grove.
In the meanwhile the Sleep-stealer came and, snatching sleep
from baby's eyes, flew away.
When mother came back she found baby travelling the room over
on all fours.
Who stole sleep from our baby's eyes? I must know. I must find
her and chain her up.
I must look into that dark cave, where, through boulders and
scowling stones, trickles a tiny stream.
I must search in the drowsy shade of the bakula grove, where
pigeons coo in their corner, and fairies' anklets tinkle in the
stillness of starry nights.
In the evening I will peep into the whispering silence of the
bamboo forest, where fireflies squander their light, and will ask
every creature I meet, ""Can anybody tell me where the Sleep-stealer
lives?""
Who stole sleep from baby's eyes? I must know.
Shouldn't I give her a good lesson if I could only catch her!
I would raid her nest and see where she hoards all her stolen
sleep.
I would plunder it all, and carry it home.
I would bind her two wings securely, set her on the bank of
the river, and then let her play at fishing with a reed among the
rushes and water-lilies.
When the marketing is over in the evening, and the village
children sit in their mothers' laps, then the night birds will
mockingly din her ears with:
""Whose sleep will you steal now?"""

at the center I would like to follow
you up the long stairway
again & become
the boat that would row you back
carefully, a flame
in two cupped hands
to where your body lies
beside me, and as you enter
it as easily as breathing in
I would like to be the air
that inhabits you for a moment
only. I would like to be that unnoticed
& that necessary."
2838,Emotion,SleepPoemsSonnetXviHappyInSleepPoembySamuelDaniel,"Happy in sleep, waking content to languish,
Embracing clouds by night; in daytime, mourn;
All things I loath save her and mine own anguish,
Pleas'd in my hurt inured to live forlorn.
Nought do I crave but love, death, or my Lady,
Hoarse with crying mercy, mercy yet my merit;
So man vows and prayers e'er made I,
That now at length t'yield, mere pity were it.
But still the Hydra of my cares renewing,
Revives new sorrows of her fresh disdaining;
Still must I go the summer winds pursuing,
Finding no end nor period of my paining.
Wail all my life, my griefs do touch so nearly,
And thus I live, because I love her dearly."
2839,Emotion,SleepPoemsLieStillSleepBecalmedPoembyDylanThomas,"Lie still, sleep becalmed, sufferer with the wound
In the throat, burning and turning. All night afloat
On the silent sea we have heard the sound
That came from the wound wrapped in the salt sheet.
Under the mile off moon we trembled listening
To the sea sound flowing like blood from the loud wound
And when the salt sheet broke in a storm of singing
The voices of all the drowned swam on the wind.
Open a pathway through the slow sad sail,
Throw wide to the wind the gates of the wandering boat
For my voyage to begin to the end of my wound,
We heard the sea sound sing, we saw the salt sheet tell.
Lie still, sleep becalmed, hide the mouth in the throat,
Or we shall obey, and ride with you through the drowned."
2840,Emotion,SleepPoemsOSleepMyBabePoembySaraColeridge,"O sleep, my babe, hear not the rippling wave,
Nor feel the breeze that round thee ling'ring strays
To drink thy balmy breath,
And sigh one long farewell.
Soon shall it mourn above thy wat'ry bed,
And whisper to me, on the wave-beat shore,
Deep murm'ring in reproach,
Thy sad untimely fate.
Ere those dear eyes had open'd on the light,
In vain to plead, thy coming life was sold,
O waken'd but to sleep,
Whence it can wake no more!
A thousand and a thousand silken leaves
The tufted beech unfolds in early spring,
All clad in tenderest green,
All of the self-same shape:
A thousand infant faces, soft and sweet,
Each year sends forth, yet every mother views
Her last not least beloved
Like its dear self alone.
No musing mind hath ever yet foreshaped
The face to-morrow's sun shall first reveal,
No heart hath e'er conceived
What love that face will bring.
O sleep, my babe, nor heed how mourns the gale
To part with thy soft locks and fragrant breath,
As when it deeply sighs
O'er autumn's latest bloom."
2841,Emotion,SleepPoemsSleepSleepBeautyBrightPoembyWilliamBlake,"Sleep! sleep! beauty bright,
Dreaming o'er the joys of night;
Sleep! sleep! in thy sleep
Little sorrows sit and weep.
Sweet Babe, in thy face
Soft desires I can trace,
Secret joys and secret smiles,
Little pretty infant wiles.
As thy softest limbs I feel,
Smiles as of the morning steal
O'er thy cheek, and o'er thy breast
Where thy little heart does rest.
O! the cunning wiles that creep
In thy little heart asleep.
When thy little heart does wake
Then the dreadful lightnings break,
From thy cheek and from thy eye,
O'er the youthful harvests nigh.
Infant wiles and infant smiles
Heaven and Earth of peace beguiles."
2842,Emotion,SleepPoemsSleepPoembySirPhilipSidney,"Come Sleep; O Sleep! the certain knot of peace,
The baiting-place of wit, the balm of woe,
The poor man's wealth, the prisoner's release,
Th' indifferent judge between the high and low;
With shield of proof shield me from out the prease
Of those fierce darts Despair at me doth throw:
O make in me those civil wars to cease;
I will good tribute pay, if thou do so.
Take thou of me smooth pillows, sweetest bed,
A chamber deaf to noise and blind of light,
A rosy garland and a weary head;
And if these things, as being thine by right,
Move not thy heavy grace, thou shalt in me,
Livelier than elsewhere, Stella's image see."
2843,Emotion,SleepPoemsDeathAndHisBrotherSleepmorphinePoembyHeinrichHeine,"There’s a mirror likeness between those two
shining, youthfully-fledged figures, though
one seems paler than the other and more austere,
I might even say more perfect, more distinguished,
than he, who would take me confidingly in his arms –
how soft then and loving his smile, how blessed his glance!
Then, it might well have been that his wreath
of white poppies gently touched my forehead, at times,
and drove the pain from my mind with its strange scent.
But that is transient. I can only, now, be well,
when the other one, so serious and pale,
the older brother, lowers his dark torch. –
Sleep is so good, Death is better, yet
surely never to have been born is best."
2844,Emotion,SleepPoemsSleepPoembyBillKnott,"We brush the other, invisible moon.
Its caves come out and carry us inside."
2845,Emotion,SleepPoemsLoveAndSleepPoembyAlgernonCharlesSwinburne,"Love and Sleep
Lying asleep between the strokes of night
I saw my love lean over my sad bed,
Pale as the duskiest lily's leaf or head,
Smooth-skinned and dark, with bare throat made to bite,
Too wan for blushing and too warm for white,
But perfect-coloured without white or red.
And her lips opened amorously, and said -
I wist not what, saving one word - Delight.
And all her face was honey to my mouth,
And all her body pasture to mine eyes;
The long lithe arms and hotter hands than fire
The quivering flanks, hair smelling of the south,
The bright light feet, the splendid supple thighs
And glittering eyelids of my soul's desire."
2846,Emotion,SleepPoemsSleepMyLovelyPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"I watch you, as you sleep,
the glow, a rosy hue
of Roman cheeks,
a tiny trickle, as if glued
onto the crease of lips
so red and so inviting,
your hands asleep
in what they call the warmest spot
of living humans,
I wish I could,
and surely would.
I am your guard tonight,
just sitting here,
prepared to be the death
of horny demons,
should they forget their place
and wander in.
I have now put the final cork away,
and opened up the kitchen clock
to rip the living battery
and put an end to it,
the pulse of time.
I shall be happy just to sit
here, by your side,
and dream about the warmth
of you, in all those feather downs.
For Angie"
2847,Emotion,SleepPoemsEndlessSleepPoembyKatherineGrams,"My lungs respond, but there's no air,
As I struggle to survive,
It hurts to know that they don't care,
Whether or not I stay alive.
The world is growing dark now,
As I drift toward the light.
I want to cry out somehow;
If I had the strength, I might.
I feel like I am falling,
Into a great abyss.
I hear past loved ones calling,
As I taste Death's tender kiss.
Finally, I have found some peace;
My soul is God's to keep.
I have finally gained release,
By slipping into endless sleep."
2848,Emotion,SleepPoemsHeGivethHisBelovedSleepPoembyBanjoPaterson,"The long day passes with its load of sorrow:
In slumber deep
I lay me down to rest until tomorrow --
Thank God for sleep.
Thank God for all respite from weary toiling,
From cares that creep
Across our lives like evil shadows, spoiling
God's kindly sleep.
We plough and sow, and, as the hours grow later,
We strive to reap,
And build our barns, and hope to build them greater
Before we sleep.
We toil and strain and strive with one another
In hopes to heap
Some greater share of profit than our brother
Before we sleep.
What will it profit that with tears or laughter
Our watch we keep?
Beyond it all there lies the Great Hereafter!
Thank God for sleep!
For, at the last, beseeching Christ to save us
We turn with deep
Heartfelt thanksgiving unto God, who gave us
The Gift of Sleep."
2849,Emotion,SleepPoemsSleepPoembyThomasBaileyAldrich,"When to oft sleep we give ourselves away,
And in a dream as in a fairy bark
Drift on and on through the enchanted dark
To purple daybreak -- little thought we pay
To that sweet bitter world we know by day.
We are clean quit of it, as is a lark
So high in heaven no human eye can mark
The thin swift pinion cleaving through the gray.
Till we awake ill fate can do no ill,
The resting heart shall not take up again
The heavy load that yet must make it bleed;
For this brief space the loud world's voice is still,
No faintest echo of it brings us pain.
How will it be when we shall sleep indeed?"
2850,Emotion,SleepPoemsSleepSleepSleepPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"Sleep, sleep, sleep
And keep
Eyes open
To feel in heaven
I shall come
To welcome
And take in arms
To keep you warm
I shall remind
You to find me
In your presence
Without feeling tense
This is the life that we wanted
And felt so excited
The dream is realized
You look so dazed
It is reality
That has been blessed by an almighty
Let us not be carried away
But cheerfully stay"
2851,Emotion,SleepPoemsLoveRecalledInSleepPoembyRobertFullerMurray,"There was a time when in your face
There dwelt such power, and in your smile
I know not what of magic grace;
They held me captive for a while.
Ah, then I listened for your voice!
Like music every word did fall,
Making the hearts of men rejoice,
And mine rejoiced the most of all.
At sight of you, my soul took flame.
But now, alas! the spell is fled.
Is it that you are not the same,
Or only that my love is dead?
I know not--but last night I dreamed
That you were walking by my side,
And sweet, as once you were, you seemed,
And all my heart was glorified.
Your head against my shoulder lay,
And round your waist my arm was pressed,
And as we walked a well-known way,
Love was between us both confessed.
But when with dawn I woke from sleep,
And slow came back the unlovely truth,
I wept, as an old man might weep
For the lost paradise of youth."
2852,Emotion,SleepPoemsYetALittleSleepPoembyRobertFullerMurray,"Beside the drowsy streams that creep
Within this island of repose,
Oh, let us rest from cares and woes,
Oh, let us fold our hands to sleep!
Is it ignoble, then, to keep
Awhile from where the rough wind blows,
And all is strife, and no man knows
What end awaits him on the deep?
The voyager may rest awhile,
When rest invites, and yet may be
Neither a sluggard nor a craven.
With strength renewed he quits the isle,
And putting out again to sea,
Makes sail for his desired haven."
2853,Emotion,SleepPoemsMySistersSleepPoembyDanteGabrielRossetti,"She fell asleep on Christmas Eve:
At length the long-ungranted shade
Of weary eyelids overweigh'd
The pain nought else might yet relieve.
Our mother, who had lean'd all day
Over the bed from chime to chime,
Then rais'd herself for the first time,
And as she sat her down, did pray.
Her little work-table was spread
With work to finish. For the glare
Made by her candle, she had care
To work some distance from the bed.
Without, there was a cold moon up,
Of winter radiance sheer and thin;
The hollow halo it was in
Was like an icy crystal cup.
Through the small room, with subtle sound
Of flame, by vents the fireshine drove
And redden'd. In its dim alcove
The mirror shed a clearness round.
I had been sitting up some nights,
And my tired mind felt weak and blank;
Like a sharp strengthening wine it drank
The stillness and the broken lights.
Twelve struck. That sound, by dwindling years
Heard in each hour, crept off; and then
The ruffled silence spread again,
Like water that a pebble stirs.
Our mother rose from where she sat:
Her needles, as she laid them down,
Met lightly, and her silken gown
Settled: no other noise than that.
""Glory unto the Newly Born!""
So, as said angels, she did say;
Because we were in Christmas Day,
Though it would still be long till morn.
Just then in the room over us
There was a pushing back of chairs,
As some who had sat unawares
So late, now heard the hour, and rose.
With anxious softly-stepping haste
Our mother went where Margaret lay,
Fearing the sounds o'erhead--should they
Have broken her long watch'd-for rest!
She stoop'd an instant, calm, and turn'd;
But suddenly turn'd back again;
And all her features seem'd in pain
With woe, and her eyes gaz'd and yearn'd.
For my part, I but hid my face,
And held my breath, and spoke no word:
There was none spoken; but I heard
The silence for a little space.
Our mother bow'd herself and wept:
And both my arms fell, and I said,
""God knows I knew that she was dead.""
And there, all white, my sister slept.
Then kneeling, upon Christmas morn
A little after twelve o'clock
We said, ere the first quarter struck,
""Christ's blessing on the newly born!"""
2854,Emotion,SleepPoemsToSleepPoembyJohnKeats,"O SOFT embalmer of the still midnight!
Shutting, with careful fingers and benign,
Our gloom-pleas'd eyes, embower'd from the light,
Enshaded in forgetfulness divine;
O soothest Sleep! if so it please thee, close,
In midst of this thine hymn, my willing eyes.
Or wait the Amen, ere thy poppy throws
Around my bed its lulling charities;
Then save me, or the passed day will shine
Upon my pillow, breeding many woes;
Save me from curious conscience, that still hoards
Its strength for darkness, burrowing like a mole;
Turn the key deftly in the oiled wards,
And seal the hushed casket of my soul."
2855,Emotion,SleepPoemsSleepSpacesPoembyRobertDesnos,"In the night there are of course the seven wonders
of the world and the greatness tragedy and enchantment.
Forests collide with legendary creatures hiding in thickets.
There is you.
In the night there are the walker's footsteps the murderer's
the town policeman's light from the street lamp and the ragman's lantern
There is you.
In the night trains go past and boats
and the fantasy of countries where it's daytime. The last breaths
of twilight and the first shivers of dawn.
There is you.
A piano tune, a shout.
A door slams. A clock.
And not only beings and things and physical sounds.
But also me chasing myself or endlessly going beyond me.
There is you the sacrifice, you that I'm waiting for.
Sometimes at the moment of sleep strange figures are born and disappear.
When I shut my eyes phosphorescent blooms appear and fade
and come to life again like fireworks made of flesh.
I pass through strange lands with creatures for company.
No doubt you are there, my beautiful discreet spy.
And the palpable soul of the vast reaches.
And perfumes of the sky and the stars the song of a rooster
from 2000 years ago and piercing screams in a flaming park and kisses.
Sinister handshakes in a sickly light and axles grinding on paralyzing roads.
No doubt there is you who I do not know, who on the contrary I do know.
But who, here in my dreams, demands to be felt without ever appearing.
You who remain out of reach in reality and in dream.
You who belong to me through my will to possess your illusion
but who brings your face near mine only if my eyes are closed in dream as well as
in reality.
You who in spite of an easy rhetoric where the waves die on the beach
where crows fly into ruined factories, where the wood rots
crackling under a lead sun.
You who are at the depths of my dreams stirring up a mind
full of metamorphoses leaving me your glove
when I kiss your hand.
In the night there are stars and the shadowy motion of the sea,
of rivers, forests, towns, grass and the lungs
of millions and millions of beings.
In the night there are the seven wonders of the world.
In the night there are no guardian angels, but there is sleep.
In the night there is you.
In the daylight too."
2856,Emotion,SleepPoemsWinterSleepPoembyEdithMatildaThomas,"I know it must be winter (though I sleep) --
I know it must be winter, for I dream
I dip my bare feet in the running stream,
And flowers are many, and the grass grows deep.
I know I must be old (how age deceives!)
I know I must be old, for, all unseen,
My heart grows young, as autumn fields grow green,
When late rains patter on the falling sheaves.
I know I must be tired (and tired souls err) --
I know I must be tired, for all my soul
To deeds of daring beats a glad, faint roll,
As storms the riven pine to music stir.
I know I must be dying (Death draws near) --
I know I must be dying, for I crave
Life -- life, strong life, and think not of the grave,
And turf-bound silence, in the frosty year."
2857,Emotion,SleepPoemsOnlyInSleepPoembySaraTeasdale,"Only in sleep I see their faces,
Children I played with when I was a child,
Louise comes back with her brown hair braided,
Annie with ringlets warm and wild.
Only in sleep Time is forgotten --
What may have come to them, who can know?
Yet we played last night as long ago,
And the doll-house stood at the turn of the stair.
The years had not sharpened their smooth round faces,
I met their eyes and found them mild --
Do they, too, dream of me, I wonder,
And for them am I too a child?"
2858,Emotion,SleepPoemsSleepPoembyAlgernonCharlesSwinburne,"Sleep, when a soul that her own clouds cover
Wails that sorrow should always keep
Watch, nor see in the gloom above her
Sleep,
Down, through darkness naked and steep,
Sinks, and the gifts of his grace recover
Soon the soul, though her wound be deep.
God beloved of us, all men's lover,
All most weary that smile or weep
Feel thee afar or anear them hover,
Sleep."
2859,Emotion,SleepPoemsHowSleepTheBravePoembyWalterdelaMare,"Bitterly, England must thou grieve —
Though none of these poor men who died
But did within his soul believe
That death for thee was glorified.
Ever they watched it hovering near —
A mystery beyond thought to plumb —
And often, in loathing and in fear,
They heard cold danger whisper, Come! —
Heard, and obeyed. Oh, if thou weep
Such courage and honour, woe, despair;
Remember too that those who sleep
No more remorse can share."

2861,Emotion,SleepPoemsIAmGoingToSleepPoembyAlfonsinaStorni,"Teeth of flowers, hairnet of dew,
hands of herbs, you, perfect wet nurse,
prepare the earthly sheets for me
and the down quilt of weeded moss.
I am going to sleep, my nurse, put me to bed.
Set a lamp at my headboard;
a constellation; whatever you like;
all are good: lower it a bit.
Leave me alone: you hear the buds breaking through . . .
a celestial foot rocks you from above
and a bird traces a pattern for you
so you'll forget . . . Thank you. Oh, one request:
if he telephones again
tell him not to keep trying for I have left . . ."

Work, sleep, work, sleep,

Oh free me please with gentle ease
From work, sleep, work, sleep, work!
This odium, pounding tedium
Of my work, sleep, work, sleep, work.
Just whisk me off to lands afar
From work, sleep, work, sleep, work -
That grinding train of rhythmic pain
Called ‘Work, sleep, work, sleep, work.’
Poor neural circuits fizzle and pop
In work, sleep, work, sleep, work,
In trying to make some sense of all this
Work, sleep, work, sleep, work.
But Hark! I see a golden gleam -
A saving spirit of hope:
‘You’re fired! ’ He screams. What news to bear,
This wondrous hangman’s rope!
So now I’m free, released from all this
Work, sleep, work, sleep, work -
Eternal peace and rest for me, no
Work, sleep, work, sleep, work."
2863,Emotion,SleepPoemsSleepPoembyJohnFletcher,"COME, Sleep, and with thy sweet deceiving
Lock me in delight awhile;
Let some pleasing dreams beguile
All my fancies; that from thence
I may feel an influence
All my powers of care bereaving!
Though but a shadow, but a sliding,
Let me know some little joy!
We that suffer long annoy
Are contented with a thought
Through an idle fancy wrought:
O let my joys have some abiding!"
2864,Emotion,SleepPoemsToSleepOrNotToSleepPoembyDónallDempsey,"To sleep

I can only dream
of peaceful sleep.
Like MacBeth

Ay, there's the rub!
I lie awake
misquoting Shakespeare
to myself."
2865,Emotion,SleepPoemsPainsOfSleepThePoembySamuelTaylorColeridge,"Ere on my bed my limbs I lay,
It hath not been my use to pray
With moving lips or bended knees ;
But silently, by slow degrees,
My spirit I to Love compose,
In humble trust mine eye-lids close,
With reverential resignation,
No wish conceived, no thought exprest,
Only a sense of supplication ;
A sense o'er all my soul imprest
That I am weak, yet not unblest,
Since in me, round me, every where
Eternal Strength and Wisdom are.
But yester-night I prayed aloud
In anguish and in agony,
Up-starting from the fiendish crowd
Of shapes and thoughts that tortured me :
A lurid light, a trampling throng,
Sense of intolerable wrong,
And whom I scorned, those only strong !
Thirst of revenge, the powerless will
Still baffled, and yet burning still !
Desire with loathing strangely mixed
On wild or hateful objects fixed.
Fantastic passions ! maddening brawl !
And shame and terror over all !
Deeds to be hid which were not hid,
Which all confused I could not know
Whether I suffered, or I did :
For all seemed guilt, remorse or woe,
My own or others still the same
Life-stifling fear, soul-stifling shame.
So two nights passed : the night's dismay
Saddened and stunned the coming day.
Sleep, the wide blessing, seemed to me
Distemper's worst calamity.
The third night, when my own loud scream
Had waked me from the fiendish dream,
O'ercome with sufferings strange and wild,
I wept as I had been a child ;
And having thus by tears subdued
My anguish to a milder mood,
Such punishments, I said, were due
To natures deepliest stained with sin,--
For aye entempesting anew
The unfathomable hell within,
The horror of their deeds to view,
To know and loathe, yet wish and do !
Such griefs with such men well agree,
But wherefore, wherefore fall on me ?
To be beloved is all I need,
And whom I love, I love indeed."
2866,Emotion,SleepPoemsLetTheNightSleepPoembySubbaramanNV,"Let the night sleep
Sleep for ever deep
With the night I sleep
Beyond the world to peep
Universe will sleep
Plants and trees
Birds and bees
Stars and moon
To sleep very soon!
Fruits and flowers
Joy with showers
Will sleep with me and the night
Not to keep the life very tight!
No dawn of the day
Right upto the dooms day!
Sleep permanent
In the world impermanent
I'll sleep without light
My agonies will sleep
My worries will sleep
My pains will sleep
My sins will sleep!
While in sleep
I am pure
I am peace
I am noble!
While my body is asleep
Awake my soul I keep
Sleep akin to death
Death akin to sleep in mirth?
Let the night sleep
Sleep for ever deep
With night I sleep
Sleep to eternity
Soul to merge in Divinity!"
2867,Emotion,SleepPoemsHowSleepTheBravePoembyWilliamCollins,"HOW sleep the brave, who sink to rest
By all their country's wishes blest!
When Spring, with dewy fingers cold,
Returns to deck their hallow'd mould,
She there shall dress a sweeter sod
Than Fancy's feet have ever trod.
By fairy hands their knell is rung;
By forms unseen their dirge is sung;
There Honour comes, a pilgrim grey,
To bless the turf that wraps their clay;
And Freedom shall awhile repair
To dwell, a weeping hermit, there!"

slowly the ponderous doors of lead imponderous
pushed by a wedging force unthinking opened
how like a cloud I floated down the dim green air
unthinking of the soft violence of odorous winds
the falling plaint of hidden violins
and eyes

II
doors unto doors unfolded downward
and I was like unto a sailing ship
stern downward sailing on a dim green sea
unmindful of the rich push of flowery winds
the melting voices of far seraphims
and arms

slowly the ponderous doors of lead imponderous
lowered above my head in absolute slow closing

2870,Emotion,SleepPoemsSleepOnPoembyWilliamSchwenckGilbert,"Fear no unlicensed entry,
Heed no bombastic talk,
While guards the British Sentry
Pall Mall and Birdcage Walk.
Let European thunders
Occasion no alarms,
Though diplomatic blunders
May cause a cry ""To arms!""
Sleep on, ye pale civilians;
All thunder-clouds defy:
On Europe's countless millions
The Sentry keeps his eye!
Should foreign-born rapscallions
In London dare to show
Their overgrown battalions,
Be sure I'll let you know.
Should Russians or Norwegians
Pollute our favoured clime
With rough barbaric legions,
I'll mention it in time.
So sleep in peace, civilians,
The Continent defy;
While on its countless millions
The Sentry keeps his eye!"
2871,Emotion,SleepPoemsTheSleepWorkerPoembyThomasHardy,"When wilt thou wake, O Mother, wake and see -
As one who, held in trance, has laboured long
By vacant rote and prepossession strong -
The coils that thou hast wrought unwittingly;
Wherein have place, unrealized by thee,
Fair growths, foul cankers, right enmeshed with wrong,
Strange orchestras of victim-shriek and song,
And curious blends of ache and ecstasy? -
Should that morn come, and show thy opened eyes
All that Life's palpitating tissues feel,
How wilt thou bear thyself in thy surprise? -
Wilt thou destroy, in one wild shock of shame,
Thy whole high heaving firmamental frame,
Or patiently adjust, amend, and heal?"
2872,Emotion,SleepPoemsSleepPoembyRabindranathTagore,"In the night of weariness
let me give myself up to sleep without struggle,
resting my trust upon thee.
Let me not force my flagging spirit into a poor preparation for thy worship.
It is thou who drawest the veil of night upon the tired eyes of the day
to renew its sight in a fresher gladness of awakening."
2873,Emotion,SleepPoemsSleepMyLoveSleepPoembyAlesiaLeach,"Sleep my love, sleep.
Rest your head on my breasts
and place yourself into my keep.
Then, dream us on a mighty quest.
To a land where dragons exist.
Where we can run through mystical forests,
as we chase unicorns through the mist.
Then, on pretty balloons will float, I promise.
As through the marsh we must flee.
Toward evil knights guarding the keep,
where the buried treasure is we seek.
Before we escape on the murmuring seas.
Sleep my love, sleep.
Close your eyes and spread your wings.
There is no reason for you to weep,
for in your dreams you are king.

With dark forgetting of my cares, return;
And let the day be time enough to mourn
The shipwreck of my ill-adventur'd youth:
Let waking eyes suffice to wail their scorn,
Without the torment of the night's untruth.
Cease dreams, th' imagery of our day-desires,
To model forth the passions of the morrow;
Never let rising sun approve you liars,
To add more grief to aggravate my sorrow.
Still let me sleep, embracing clouds in vain;
And never wake to feel the day's disdain."
2875,Emotion,SleepPoemsYouLikeToTalkInYourSleepPoembyJeffFleischer,"You like to talk in your sleep.
Your dream must be so deep.
You say the words I want to hear.
You say you always want me near.
And I know that its true
Cause I hear it
When I'm sleeping next to you.
And in the morning when you wake,
My hand you will take.
You will put it to your heart,
And the day we will start.
And when you're dreaming again in bed
I'll hear the loving things that will be said."
2876,Emotion,SleepPoemsSleepFliesMePoembyRobertFullerMurray,"Sleep flies me like a lover
Too eagerly pursued,
Or like a bird to cover
Within some distant wood,
Where thickest boughs roof over
Her secret solitude.
The nets I spread to snare her,
Although with cunning wrought,
Have only served to scare her,
And now she'll not be caught.
To those who best could spare her,
She ever comes unsought.
She lights upon their pillows;
She gives them pleasant dreams,
Grey-green with leaves of willows,
And cool with sound of streams,
Or big with tranquil billows,
On which the starlight gleams.
No vision fair entrances
My weary open eye,
No marvellous romances
Make night go swiftly by;
But only feverish fancies
Beset me where I lie.
The black midnight is steeping
The hillside and the lawn,
But still I lie unsleeping,
With curtains backward drawn,
To catch the earliest peeping
Of the desired dawn.
Perhaps, when day is breaking;
When birds their song begin,
And, worn with all night waking,
I call their music din,
Sweet sleep, some pity taking,
At last may enter in."
2877,Emotion,SleepPoemsBellsPoolAndSleepPoembyArthurSeymourJohnTessimond,"Bells overbrim with sound
And spread from cupolas
Out through the shaking air
Endless unbreaking circles
Cool and clear as water.
A stone dropped in the water
Opens the lips of the pool
And starts the unovertaking
Rings, till the pool is full
Of waves as the air of bells.
The deep-sea bell of sleep
Under the pool of the mind
Flowers in concentric circles
Of annihilation till
Both sight and sound die out,
Both pool and bells are quelled.

2878,Emotion,SleepPoemsTheCityOfSleepPoembyRudyardKipling,"Over the edge of the purple down,
Where the single lamplight gleams,
Know ye the road to the Merciful Town
That is hard by the Sea of Dreams--
Where the poor may lay their wrongs away,
And the sick may forget to weep?
But we--pity us! Oh, pity us!
We wakeful; ah, pity us! --
We must go back with Policeman Day--
Back from the City of Sleep!
Weary they turn from the scroll and crown,
Fetter and prayer and plough--
They that go up to the Merciful Town,
For her gates are closing now.
It is their right in the Baths of Night
Body and soul to steep,
But we--pity us! ah, pity us!
We wakeful; oh, pity us!--
We must go back with Policeman Day--
Back from the City of Sleep!
Over the edge of the purple down,
Ere the tender dreams begin,
Look--we may look--at the Merciful Town,
But we may not enter in!
Outcasts all, from her guarded wall
Back to our watch we creep:
We--pity us! ah, pity us!
We wakeful; oh, pity us!--
We that go back with Policeman Day--
Back from the City of Sleep!"

Beyond the bay, city, beyond the city, ocean,
Beyond the ocean, ocean, till Japan.
To the left dry hills with white grass,
Beyond the hills an irrigated valley where rice is grown,
Beyond the valley, mountains and Ponderosa pines,
Beyond the mountains, desert and sheep.

When I couldn't do without cigarettes and coffee, I drove myself

But that is good for nothing.
I feel a pain.

Not here. No,
Maybe it's too

Please, Medicine Man, I feel a pain.
I always believed in spells and incantations.
Sure, women have only one, Catholic, soul,
But we have two. When you start to dance
You visit remote pueblos in your sleep
And even lands you have never seen.
Put on, I beg you, charms made of feathers,
Now it's time to help one of your own.
I have read many books but I don't believe them.
When it hurts we return to the banks of certain rivers.
I remember those crosses with chiseled suns and moons
And wizards, how they worked during an outbreak of typhus.
Send your second soul beyond the mountains, beyond time.
Tell me what you saw, I will wait."

Counting no sheep and careless of chimes
Welcoming the dawn confabulation
Of birch, her children, who discuss idly
Fanciful details of the promised coming -
Will she be wearing red, or russet, or blue,
Or pure white? - whatever she wears, glorious:
Not to sleep all the night long, for pure joy,
This is given to few but at last to me,
So that when 1 laugh and stretch and leap from bed
I shall glide downstairs, my feet brushing the carpet
In courtesy to civilized progression,
Though, did 1 wish, I could soar through the open window
And perch on a branch above, acceptable ally
Of the birds still alert, grumbling gently together."
2881,Emotion,SleepPoemsSleepPoembyRussellEdson,"There was a man who didn't know how to sleep; nodding
off every night into a drab, unprofessional sleep. Sleep that
he'd grown so tired of sleeping.
He tried reading The Manual of Sleep, but it just put him
to sleep. That same old sleep that he had grown so tired of
sleeping . . .
He needed a sleeping master, who with a whip and a
chair would discipline the night, and make him jump through
hoops of gasolined fire. Someone who could make a tiger sit
on a tiny pedestal and yawn . . ."
2882,Emotion,SleepPoemsTwentyGallonsOfSleepPoembyAgnesLouiseStorrie,"MEASURE me out from the fathomless tun
That somewhere or other you keep
In your vasty cellars, O wealthy one,
Twenty gallons of sleep.
Twenty gallons of balmy sleep,
Dreamless, and deep, and mild,
Of the excellent brand you used to keep
When I was a little child.
I’ve tasted of all your vaunted stock,
Your clarets and ports of Spain,
The liquid gold of your famous hock,
And your matchless dry champagne.
Of your rich muscats and your sherries fine,
I’ve drunk both well and deep;
Then measure me out, O merchant mine,
Twenty gallons of sleep.
Twenty gallons of slumber soft,
Of the innocent, baby kind,
When the angels flutter their wings aloft
And the pillow with down is lined.
I have drawn the corks, and drained the lees,
Of every vintage pressed;
If I’ve felt the sting of my honey bees,
I’ve taken it with the rest.
I have lived my life, and I’ll not repine;
As I sowed I was bound to reap;
Then measure me out, O merchant mine,
Twenty gallons of sleep."
2883,Emotion,SleepPoemsTheresSomethingQuieterThanSleepPoembyEmilyDickinson,"45
There's something quieter than sleep
Within this inner room!
It wears a sprig upon its breast—
And will not tell its name.
Some touch it, and some kiss it—
Some chafe its idle hand—
It has a simple gravity
I do not understand!
I would not weep if I were they—
How rude in one to sob!
Might scare the quiet fairy
Back to her native wood!
While simple-hearted neighbors
Chat of the ""Early dead""—
We—prone to periphrasis
Remark that Birds have fled!"
2884,Emotion,SleepPoemsTheHouseOfSleepPoembyRobertFullerMurray,"When we have laid aside our last endeavour,
And said farewell to one or two that weep,
And issued from the house of life for ever,
To find a lodging in the house of sleep -
With eyes fast shut, in sunless chambers lying,
With folded arms unmoved upon the breast,
Beyond the noise of sorrow and of crying,
Beyond the dread of dreaming, shall we rest?
Or shall there come at last desire of waking,
To walk again on hillsides that we know,
When sunrise through the cold white mist is breaking,
Or in the stillness of the after-glow?
Shall there be yearning for the sound of voices,
The sight of faces, and the touch of hands,
The will that works, the spirit that rejoices,
The heart that feels, the mind that understands?
Shall dreams and memories crowding from the distance,
Shall ghosts of old ambition or of mirth,
Create for us a shadow of existence,
A dim reflection of the life of earth?
And being dead, and powerless to recover
The substance of the show whereon we gaze,
Shall we be likened to the hapless lover,
Who broods upon the unreturning days?
Not so: for we have known how swift to perish
Is man's delight when youth and health take wing,
Until the winter leaves him nought to cherish
But recollections of a vanished spring.
Dream as we may, desire of life shall never
Disturb our slumbers in the house of sleep.
Yet oh, to think we may not greet for ever
The one or two that, when we leave them, weep!"
2885,Emotion,SleepPoemsSleepPoembyMathildeBlind,"Love-cradling Night, lit by the lucent moon,
Most pitiful and mother-hearted Night!
Blest armistice in life's tumultuous fight,
Resolving discords to a spheral tune!
When tired with heat and strenuous toil of noon,
With ceaseless conflict betwixt might and right,
With ebb and flow of sorrow and delight,
Our panting hearts beneath their burdens swoon:
To thee, O star-eyes comforter, we creep,
Earth's ill-used step-children to thee make moan,
As hiding in thy dark skirts' ample sweep;
--Poor debtors whose brief life is not their own;
For dunned by Death, to whom we owe its loan,
Give us, O Night, the interest paid in sleep."
2886,Emotion,SleepPoemsJerusalemISeeTheFourFoldManTheHumanityInDeadlySleepPoembyWilliamBlake,"I see the Four-fold Man, The Humanity in deadly sleep
And its fallen Emanation, the Spectre and its cruel Shadow.
I see the Past, Present and Future existing all at once
Before me. O Divine Spirit, sustain me on thy wings,
That I may awake Albion from his long and cold repose;
For Bacon and Newton, sheath'd in dismal steel, their terrors hang
Like iron scourges over Albion: reasonings like vast serpents
Infold around my limbs, bruising my minute articulations.
I turn my eyes to the schools and universities of Europe
And there behold the Loom of Locke, whose Woof rages dire,
Wash'd by the Water-wheels of Newton: black the cloth
In heavy wreaths folds over every nation: cruel works
Of many Wheels I view, wheel without wheel, with cogs tyrannic
Moving by compulsion each other, not as those in Eden, which,
Wheel within wheel, in freedom revolve in harmony and peace."
2887,Emotion,SleepPoemsMyAngelILoveToWatchYouSleepPoembyRaviSathasivam,"When the night comes then your voice calm down
When the moon begin to sail in the sky
then your eyes are closing down to sleep
You fall asleep while dim light illuminates your room
I love to watch you sleep my little girl
You sleep like a little angel within your dreams
Your hair falls both sides of your face and
your hands  folded in to the blanket
Your pillows and bunnies are speard around you
You breath soft and low while your innocent heart
beat slowly to the merry tune
I love to watch you sleep my little baby
When I want to kiss you to say good night in your sleep
then you toss your head and stretch your little body
and turn around sleep again while holding your pillow
God brought you to me and given you as his gift
and today you are the greatest treasure in my life
Someone to laugh and dance and sing in my home
I love to watch you sleep my angel

2888,Emotion,SleepPoemsThePainsOfSleepPoembySamuelTaylorColeridge,"Ere on my bed my limbs I lay,
It hath not been my use to pray
With moving lips or bended knees ;
But silently, by slow degrees,
My spirit I to Love compose,
In humble trust mine eye-lids close,
With reverential resignation,
No wish conceived, no thought exprest,
Only a sense of supplication ;
A sense o'er all my soul imprest
That I am weak, yet not unblest,
Since in me, round me, every where
Eternal Strength and Wisdom are.
But yester-night I prayed aloud
In anguish and in agony,
Up-starting from the fiendish crowd
Of shapes and thoughts that tortured me :
A lurid light, a trampling throng,
Sense of intolerable wrong,
And whom I scorned, those only strong !
Thirst of revenge, the powerless will
Still baffled, and yet burning still !
Desire with loathing strangely mixed
On wild or hateful objects fixed.
Fantastic passions ! maddening brawl !
And shame and terror over all !
Deeds to be hid which were not hid,
Which all confused I could not know
Whether I suffered, or I did :
For all seemed guilt, remorse or woe,
My own or others still the same
Life-stifling fear, soul-stifling shame.
So two nights passed : the night's dismay
Saddened and stunned the coming day.
Sleep, the wide blessing, seemed to me
Distemper's worst calamity.
The third night, when my own loud scream
Had waked me from the fiendish dream,
O'ercome with sufferings strange and wild,
I wept as I had been a child ;
And having thus by tears subdued
My anguish to a milder mood,
Such punishments, I said, were due
To natures deepliest stained with sin,--
For aye entempesting anew
The unfathomable hell within,
The horror of their deeds to view,
To know and loathe, yet wish and do !
Such griefs with such men well agree,
But wherefore, wherefore fall on me ?
To be beloved is all I need,
And whom I love, I love indeed."
2889,Emotion,SleepPoemsYearsOfBeautySleepPoembyTedSheridan,"She sleeps as my tired old eyes make love to her....
Her long grey hair frames her gentle face and softly touches
Both of her round and dimpled alabaster colored shoulders
My sense of smell is enticed beyond any simple fantasy
The fullness of her gardenia powdered hips and thighs
Leave me breathless and still filled with the same anticipation
As when we were both so young....
I find that one spot in the small of her back with my fingers
And without disturbing her
I place a warm wet kiss there for my safe keeping...

2890,Emotion,LonelyPoemsLonelyInTheDarkPoembynouriblack,"I am living in the darkness
I feel so scared
I feel unsafe
I dont know what to do
I cry everyday and night
And I feel that I want to cry more and more
Non stop
It really dark here
I hear my mom voice
But I cant reach her
And I hear my friends calling me
But they cant hear me
I dont know what to do
I start screaming and screaming
But suddenly their voices r gone
They leave me all alone in the darkness
I start crying again and again
And suddenly
A light so weak appears, shivering in the dark
I didnt know what it was
I feel so endangered
I saw an extended hand
That wants to grab me towards its unrevealed body
I ran away
I hear a male vioce
Calling my name
Telling me that he wants to save me
I turn and look at him
I thought he was just like an angel
Just like an angel in a human body
With flesh and blood
He took my hand
To show me the way
When I was out of the dark
He gave me a butterfly
He gave me a butterfly
And with it
He filled my heart with hope
Gave me a reason to never give up
Just knowing that some one,
Somewhere
Actually cared about me,
Loved me
That will give me all the strength i need to live
To survive"

2894,Emotion,LonelyPoemsSadAndLonelyPoembyTaherShemaly,"As I started sipping
my daily lovely coffee
A race of memories just began in my mind
of old days, the hard and the easy
And looking at myself now with a tear in my eye
just to find myself sad and lonely
And as I walk down that antique street
where my old little house was meant to be
It feels hard to breathe just to know
that I am out of it now and maybe
maybe forever I would be like a rover
that tells stories of how sad I am and lonely
Those stairs I used to go up and down
everyday in fast rhythm used to be happy
In my room I used to stay most of the time
never thought that i would live in a tragedy
But words are not useful now
for sad I am and lonely
Though poverty was my company long ago
but riches couldn't bring back honey
The honey I saw in my sweet old days
Days of the poverty and agony
Believe me my friend riches won't give you a thing
But to make you sad and lonely"
2895,Emotion,LonelyPoemsOneLonelyAfternoonPoembyRussellEdson,"Since the fern can't go to the sink for a drink of
water, I graciously submit myself to the task, bringing two
glasses from the sink.
And so we sit, the fern and I, sipping water together.
Of course I'm more complex than a fern, full of deep
thoughts as I am. But I lay this aside for the easy company
of an afternoon friendship.
I don't mind sipping water with a fern, even though,
had I my druthers, I'd be speeding through the sky for
Stockholm, sipping a bloody mary with a wedge of lime.
And so we sit one lonely afternoon sipping water
together. The fern looking out of its fronds, and I, looking
out of mine . . ."
2896,Emotion,LonelyPoemsALonelyOneRoomSchoolPoembyMarilynLott,"It is now old and in need of paint
Sits alone in a field of grass
Poor little lonely one room school
So long ago since it’s had class
If only it could tell us stories
Of the children who sat in its seats
Buzzing with exciting chatter
Never thinking they’d face defeat
School books worn on the corners
For turning down pages a thing to do
Buckets design for their small lunches
Old-fashioned hats that set askew
Oh listen, can you hear the laughter?
Reciting their lessons every day
Recess time in the school yard
It was important to take time to play
But you know, nothing lasts forever
Except, of course, the golden rule
I feel a bit sad when I look upon
This precious lonely one room school!"
2897,Emotion,LonelyPoemsLonelyVexationPoembyCharveeRehani,"Isolation accompanies me,
whispering melodically in my ear..
Confusion is mocking me,
with its mirthless smile, it stands near..
The silence that surrounds me..
Speaks of many fears..
and savage loneliness, a glorious creature..
is gnawing me with her teeth.
These beasts that form my world,
Are my companions who laugh my way..
promising external continuation,
of all this pain i breathe.
Nothing will change, they tell me..
There is no course to improve..!
Truth, hiding in the shadows,
fiction, standing bright before my eyes..
Searching, pushing,
Nothing is as it seems..
We clamour and we fight..
Making fists at the brightness..
wondering what it is..
who it is.. what it means..
If truth should consume us,
If God can live with us..
then why are we soo empty..? ?
Always, with the conundrum of our desires..? ?
Our life..our lackings..? ?
There is darkness, they say..
And there is light..
But sometimes.. fuzzy and faint illuminations.. are all the shades i see..
My life's play is written..
And there are no foot lights..
only actors and actresses..
who are not willing to share the performance..
So i sit alone..
On a dark stage..
without U..! !"

When no one else is around
Her brown eyes cry those tears
Over her loves from the past years
Her heart is breaking without a sound
On the lonely side of town
She feels just like a clown
With tears pouring from her eyes
With no rhymn or reason why
But life has turned her upside down
On the lonely side of town
Her head is hanging down
Shaking from side to side
With not much left of her pride
There on that lonely side of town
On the lonely side of town
She is lost behind her frown
But in ways she may never know
Her love fine it's way to show
And by her love she is bound
On the lonely side of town
You can hear the old train sound
Reminding her of those days
When life glowed with brighter rays
Even on that lonely side of town
On the lonely side of town
She is loved by leaps and bounds
Even though she may not see
Love'S the only thing that's free
And it creaps up on her without a sound"

I so look forward to everything.This place takes away the sadness
of life and it's memories that cut right in like a blade from a knife.
These two days a week that have become heaven to me, they
take away that distance of far gone memory.
Then when it is all over the weekend appears and so
does reality and all my fears. Then Tuesday is here again
from a weekend so long, and all the birds  are back in song.
There are pictures that I want to paint with masterly art,
but they are hidden deep within my aged heart.

My weekends are lonely, but I manage to cope
because I live for the days at The Centre of Hope.

Alone with no life.
Trying to kill her spirit
That is beginning to die inside.
Alone in her Hell.
Alone in her abyss.
Attempting to end her being
As it pours from her wrists.
Alone without a chance.
Alone with no hope.
Watching the stained blade
As she frees her soul.
Alone in the air.
Alone as she drifts.
Slicing so she can escape
The nightmare's images.
Alone with no will.
Alone with no dreams.
Suicide killing her thoughts,
Silencing her heart's beats."

The girl with the lonely heart,
The girl with no boy to love,
But she didnt see what mattered.

Tears running, the people they stared.
Untill now, they never knew,
She was just a lonely girl, with a lonely heart waiting for someone to love."

Before me is the ocean,
The stormy Irish Sea,
It comes to me, I’m part of you,
And know, you’re part of me.
You send a wave to kiss my feet,
And then you back away,
You tantalise, you hypnotise,
You hold me, make me sway.
I grip the rock to steady me,
Lest I fall in too deep,
I’m lost in love for you now,
The way back now, so steep.
Another wave comes crashing,
Bestows a gentle kiss,
And now I get to taste you,
You linger on my lips.
I’m filled now with a passion,
For you, I can’t ignore,
I’m satisfied, contented,
And leave you on the shore."

for silence will not harbor lies.
I want to hear your voice when I'm not with you
as if it were my own thoughts
and love was never alone.
I want to see in your eyes the truth inside me
so that everyday that I question
I can look at you and know.
I want to take your loneliness
and paint it over with bright memories
till only love is in view.
Should the stars appear for just one night every thousand years
I would wait a lonely eternity
to see them with just you."

the clouds to be generous and
Pour its sorrow-ridden soul
Over the parched lips of the earth.

cannot confide in the heavens
for a shower of tears.
Her eyes stopped feeling,
Her senses now deceive her,
Her thoughts are clouded; her touch is gone,
Her words don’t bear any meaning.
Tears come forth
With pain in the heart.
What do the eyes shed
when there is no tear to fall?
The pleasure of relief does not come
Because the pain remains,
In the sorrow-ridden soul
without a river to run."

Day in day out with the routine
She stays to herself, not often seen
The blinds stay closed, not much light
Shes accepted this, it is to be her plight
He gets off work, comes home and watches t.v.
The house so quiet, just him and she
They go to bed, each on thier own side
He no longer cares to hold his bride
In the morning he will go back to work
Once again she will be alone, where bad thoughts lurk!"
2912,Emotion,LonelyPoemsOneLastLonelyFlightPoembyDónallDempsey,"Butterflies that flew
in 1932
still held in that summer
by the equisitely neat caligraphy
& cruel glinting pin.
I wipe the dust
from the glass
& they gleam
as if they still dream
of being
alive.
i smash the glass
clutch them in my hand & climb
from attic to roof
& slowly
drawing myself up to
my full height
release them
back into time
smile as they flutter
in the summer breeze
of then & now
their dead eyes
taking it
clouds...trees...skies
their one last lonely flight
back into nothingness"
2913,Emotion,LonelyPoemsMySweetLonelyLittleWorldPoembyJasbirChatterjee,"Come, step
into my sweet, lonely little world!
Hand in hand,
We shall run across the cliffs
against which my emotions crash,
Fly through the capricious clouds
Through which my wild fancies fly,
Swim in the deep waters of the sea
in which lie buried the secrets of my heart,
Sing and dance
to the music of the swaying plants and the whistling winds,
and when weary and hungry,
eat the Forbidden Fruit.........
But perhaps you would wish to run away,
Perhaps you have your own sweet, lonely little world......
But first,
Come, step
into my sweet, lonely little world!"

2916,Emotion,LonelyPoemsLostAndLonelyMustReadPoembyIwishiwasasinvisableashemademefeel,"My inner sides are twisting,
my heart is losing pace,
my legs are always shaking,
i no longer hold my grace.
My mind is slowly bending,
im crippled in by pain,
my face is red and crumpled,
as my eyes begin to rain.
Im turning from the living,
and im racing to the dead,
im spinning and im falling,
my dyings just ahead.
My heart is burst in agony,
my blood is draining out,
my voice is just a memory,
i no longer scream and shout.
My legs have no more feeling,
i've hit the cold hard ground,
And i'll lie here in a twisted mess,
untill by love im found............."
2917,Emotion,LonelyPoemsLonelyAndLostPoembydonteverask,"While every single human rests,
and the nightly creatures claim their place,
the sweet sound of silence,
combines with the profound darkness of the night.
The chilling breeze is unnoticed,
The howling of the dogs, ignored,
Who's paying attention anyway?
Their dreams are trapping their souls.
In this mistic, magic moment,
everything's forgotten,
Unconsciousness is everyone's sovereign.
And as stars get brighter,
in the dark blue sky,
And as the owls chant,
their ancient song,
He defies the nightly reign,
by staying awake.
He doesn't belong to the world,
He's an outcast from our own race,
Nature rejects him,
Darkness loves him,
People forget him.
In the middle of his beloved night,
between menacing shadows,
and flickering lights,
He lays down on the cold stone,
embraced by silence,
heated by loneliness,
desiring nothing,
expecting no-one.
Immersed in his thoughts,
he suddenly realizes the awful truth,
'This, is death, lonely, mistic, personal'
'This, is death, absolute solitude'
'This, is death, meaningless, obligatory'
'This, is death, though I'm still alive'
'This, is death, for my soul has already died'"
2918,Emotion,LonelyPoemsAloneAndLonelyPoembysaniaharris,"She ran towards me
On her face was a huge glee
She looked at her mummy and plead
“I want him mummy” she said
“I’ll name him Jim
I’ll play with him
I’ll take him for walks
I’ll make him stay away from your frocks
I’ll make him clean
Like a king I’ll let him reign
And Julie will be his queen
I’ll teach him tricks
I’ll take him with me for picnics
I’ll look after him when he is sick
I’ll always be there for him
He’ll be my only Jim
Please mummy
Can I keep him? ”
Her mummy replied with a yes
And I knew me, god really did bless
I stood away from mess
And I bent towards my new mistress
She came towards me
But moved to my right;
Where Rawky, my friend was sitting
She took him in her arms and said
“Thank you mama,
Thanks for letting me keep Jim”
My dreams were shattered
It was not me whom she wanted
I laid my head down
And closed my dark eyes
I knew I was alone
Alone in this lonely world
Because I am just a dog
An ugly and lonely stray dog"

Two is company
One is the last word in alone
That’s what I’ve been since you left me
One is also in lonesome
The last word in it is me
Alone and lonesome
Seems that is all I’ll ever be
We were perfect together
So everyone said
We had everything going
Only good times ahead
Then without warning
or angry words said
You took the first train in the morning
Leaving me with bad times ahead

Silent and dark and tractless swells,
The waves of some wild streamlet pour
Hurriedly through its ferny dells.
Profoundly still the twilight air,
Lifeless the landscape; so we deem
Till like a phantom gliding near
A stag bends down to drink the stream.
And far away a mountain zone,
A cold, white waste of snow-drifts lies,
And one star, large and soft and lone,
Silently lights the unclouded skies."

Cries night and day

Seems miles away
Though we're together
Day by Day

Cries night and days
Is there any
Consolation
For my lonely heart?"
2924,Emotion,LonelyPoemsTheLonelyTrainOnTheLonelyTrackWith24CoachesPaintedBlackPoembyHarindharReddy,"Among the brambles of a shattered heart lies my soul in crags,
Among the shambles of life torn apart lies my spirit in rags;
Tears streaming down my face as snakes crawl on my body lifeless
Leaving amigos and flamingos away at the home, oh life pointless.
Ticktock! All I can hear is the ticking of the clock, yackety-yak!
The lonely train on the lonely track with 24 coaches painted black.
I climbed onto the gravel bed in the rain, lo lonely brain tames!
By the dawn from the ocean to every lane, it climbs, dookie salad!
In the noon from flat places to heaven and hell, A pensive ballad;
At dusk, in open air of beach I loitered singing rhyme ugly James.
Ticktock! All I can hear is ticking of the clock - yackety-yak!
The lonely train on the lonely track with 24 coaches painted black.
Hardy-har-har! Hold a pebble, a feather or a leaf in your hand
It will say I am lonely; I can't ride, I want to hide in the sand;
I'm single; oh my gosh! I'm sitting between my brother the mountain
My sister the sea - together threesome we live among soulless men.
Ticktock! All I can hear is the ticking of the clock, yackety-yak!
The lonely train on the lonely track with 24 coaches painted black.
I'm an air castle with dreams empty and screams plenty with terror
I don't want to be alone in the dark in a spine-chilling horror.
Then, the moon is a friend for the lonely man as flamingo cheers,
Bingo! Stars in the Galaxy are his companions as nature shares.
Ticktock! All I can hear is ticking of the clock, yackety-yak!
The lone train on the lonely track with 24 coaches painted black."

In the walks of life

Alone in the life

Who comes to be
Unfit for the lonely soul
The lonely soul wanders
As the days pass by
The lonely soul became
More lonely, with no other

Alone in the walks of life
The lonely soul decides
Not to die, but to face
Life in all its hardships

Roaming the vast prairie
Waiting for somebody
To come and visit me
Occasionally I'll see
A car or truck around
I'm stand here just waiting
In my deserted prairie ground
I'm quite a handsome fellow
Just look here for yourself
Sometimes I feel my owner
Has put me on the shelf
I'm good for many things
I could win as a show horse
If someone only entered me
Into a show of course
But pretty soon I know
The kids will come on by
Visit me and ride me
And on my back they'll fly!"

2928,Emotion,LonelyPoemsLonelyGodBehindMyEyesPoembyRobertRorabeck,"There is a lonely God behind my eyes
Who still cries for you who are so far
Away, like a lost child forgotten who she is,
Her identity soothed away by time
So she becomes someone else’s child,
Though my God remembers how she played
Before him once or twice in the early days
Before the world was fully formed—
There is a lonely God behind my eyes
Who screams at things because you can not
Hear him, who hates everything he sees
And wanders far up into the glacial lakes
Of my cranium where he sits on a nameless
Stone and cries your name, the word
That would set him free if he saw you dressed
In the fine syllables your parents christened
You with. There is a lonely God behind
My eyes who has tried to commit suicide
Just because he no longer believed he existed,
Because he knows not a thing to be true
Except that you have walked away, like a
Ghost shed of identity, so now you float down
The roads and caress nameless men thoughtlessly,
Forever and ever forgetting how your love
Was the fulcrum for this creation, how
Everything began to bloom as you opened
Your eyes. There is a lonely God behind my
Eyes who still cries for you who holds the
Key, who has forgotten."

I know some lonely Houses off the Road
A Robber'd like the look of—
Wooden barred,
And Windows hanging low,
Inviting to—
A Portico,
Where two could creep—
One—hand the Tools—
The other peep—
To make sure All's Asleep—
Old fashioned eyes—
Not easy to surprise!
How orderly the Kitchen'd look, by night,
With just a Clock—
But they could gag the Tick—
And Mice won't bark—
And so the Walls—don't tell—
None—will—
A pair of Spectacles ajar just stir—
An Almanac's aware—
Was it the Mat—winked,
Or a Nervous Star?
The Moon—slides down the stair,
To see who's there!
There's plunder—where—
Tankard, or Spoon—
Earring—or Stone—
A Watch—Some Ancient Brooch
To match the Grandmama—
Staid sleeping—there—
Day—ratt les—too
Stealth's—slow—
T he Sun has got as far
As the third Sycamore—
Screams Chanticleer
""Who's there""?
And Echoes—Trains away,
Sneer—""Where""!
While the old Couple, just astir,
Fancy the Sunrise—left the door ajar!"

to find the pain in lonely eyes

they cry alone but no one cares
Friendless days and last goodbyes
lie in the heart of lonely eyes"

How to describe it?
Maybe a leaf on a snow covered field,
Maybe a log in the middle of a lake,
Maybe a snow flake in the middle of June,
Maybe a tree in a crater on the moon,
Maybe a canoe in the middle of a forest,
Maybe a star in the middle of the day,
Or maybe me, in the middle of you."
2933,Emotion,LonelyPoemsIWanderedLonelyAsACloudDaffodilsPoembyWilliamWordsworth,"I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
The waves beside them danced; but they
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not but be gay,
In such a jocund company:
I gazed- and gazed- but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:
For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils."
2934,Emotion,LonelyPoemsALonelyLittleHousePoembyMarilynLott,"A lonely little house
Built many years ago
Is deteriorating now
I thought you’d like to know
Its boards are warped and falling
One by one onto the ground
But mostly in the stillness
You can’t hear a single sound
Except when the cattle are grazing
Around the house at times
A cowbell occasionally clinks
Like a soft ringing of chimes
Its roof now is sinking
Its windows too are gone
Time and weather are not helping
But it knows where it belongs
For the stories this house could tell
Are so many from its prime
It housed a growing family
Once upon a time
I love the frontier houses
That were built to run a farm
Part of the past we inherited
They will always have such charm!"
2935,Emotion,LonelyPoemsAboveTheLonelyMarketDawnPoembyANDREWBLAKEMORE,"Above the lonely market dawn
The sun begins to rise,
And slowly makes its way into
The glowing ember skies,
Amidst the clouds of burning gold
And scarlet which now pass,
Across the heavens high above
My sadness stays alas.
And now I stand there all alone
And watch the morning light,
Creep over all the rooftops and
Consume the dead of night,
It shines upon the sleeping town
Where calmness fills the air,
And lights the dark and empty stalls
With metal frames so bare.
The pigeons rest on rooftops while
The litter's strewn around,
The remnants of the day before
Lie restless on the ground,
The paper cups and cans do roll
Upon the breeze that blows,
And come to rest against a wall
Behind those empty rows.
So still the rising morning now
The shadows long and dark,
The cold and empty marketplace
Deserted and so stark,
I walk alone with heavy heart
Beyond the barren square,
And look towards the church ahead
Its loneliness I share."
2936,Emotion,LonelyPoemsTheLonelyWomanPoembyMabelForrest,"WHERE the ironbarks are hanging leaves disconsolate and pale,
Where the wild vines o’er the ranges their spilt cream of blossom trail,
By the door of the bark humpey, by the rotting blood-wood gates,
On the river-bound selection, there a lonely woman waits,
Waits and watches gilded sunrise glow behind the mountain peak,
Hears the water hens’ shrill piping, in the rushes by the creek,
And by the sullen stormy sunsets, when the anxious cattle call,
Sees the everlasting gum-trees closing round her like a wall.
With the hunger of her bosom notes the wild birds seek their mates,
All alone and heavy-hearted, there the lonely woman waits.
Where the tall brown city buildings loom against a cloud-flecked sky,
Where along the curving tramlines brightly varnished cars rush by,
Where the call of petty traders echoes down the dusty street,
And forever comes the beating of the many passing feet,
Where the bamboo reeds are whispering by the green park’s iron gates,
By the muslin-curtained window, there a lonely woman waits.
Where the white caps lash the sea-wall, and the great waves thunder by,
Where the grey rains sweep the beaches underneath a sodden sky,
Where the swift-winged gull flies landward, and the fisher bides at home,
When the long Pacific reaches are a seething stretch of foam,
Where the empty boat drifts seawards, by the ocean’s sand-flanked gates,
In the weather-boarded cottage, there a lonely woman waits.
Where the river boats are calling, where the railway engine shrieks,
Or where only wild bird liltings echo from the reedy creeks,
Where the grey waves grieve to landward, and a wet wind beats the seas,
Or where pearl-white moths flit slowly through the dropping wattle-trees,
By the high verandah pillars, by the rotting bloodwood gates,
Crowded town or dreary seaboard, everywhere some woman waits!"
2937,Emotion,LonelyPoemsTheEternalStruggleOfTheLonelyPoembyScottDoherty,"When you're with him
I lose my mind
For your love is what
I've struggled to find
From the highest mountain
To the valleys below
Wherever your love existed
My heart would follow
But now you're with him
And I've lost my way
Without you my life is shrouded
In darkness all day
The object of your desire
Lies far past me
For I am blind
And he can see
I am eternally blinded
From reality
For your love of me
Is just a fantasy
I toss and turn
When I struggle to rest
For how can I rest
When I'm not the best
To be the best in your eyes
Is my only goal
To be the tree
In your flowering atoll
I will best him
I'll find a way
I'll show you the true power
Of love someday
But now I lie
In the shadows, alone
Making amends
And peacefully atoning
For I know what I've done
And what I plan to do
All for the sake of you
So forever I struggle
To be the best in your eyes
Though I know your love
Is nothing but lies
Fantasy, reality
Blurred within
Maybe you are better off with him"

'Old, old man, it is the wisdom of the age.'
The sage looked upon me with admiration."

And months of indecision,
After insufferable nights of tears
Reflecting on kisses once placed
On your gentle moonlight face,
My broken heart receives crystal clear vision:
When love has ended
And friendship wanes,
One must depart the city
Of all his shattered dreams
And find a new place
To begin again,
Unknown paths to tread
Where there is no fear
Of finding a perfumed handkerchief
You once kept
Or of running into a mutual friend
Who saw him weep
The last lonely night
He walked upon your street."

heart became dry, and it seemed to me that beauty was a thing
fashioned by the traders in words. Tired I shut the book and
snuffed the candle. In a moment the room was flooded with
moonlight.
Spirit of Beauty, how could you, whose radiance overbrims the

Trickles down the cheek

And tried to understand

still and silently fall to the ground,
no echo of footsteps are heard,
as nothing makes a sound.
There is no laughter of lovers,
no hush as they embrace;
nothing disturbs the silence,
of our lonely lover’s lane.
One-day lovers will walk there
know the happiness we knew.
One-day lovers will kiss there,
and know how I felt about you.
They will stop and admire the stillness,
that almost takes the breath away,
and feel the warmth of each other,
near the closing of the day."

You’ve never gone in my heart
Oh why, oh why

That weep overlooking the flowerless city;
All the roses reside in your vulnerable eyes
Where I fall asleep for fragile centuries.
There’s a sunlight glint
On dining-room wine bottles;
Even when my love feels
Exhausted and half-spent,
I have another glass to pour for you.
Always refuse to be carried
By the melancholy breeze that whistles
Through the cemetery trees
Sympathetic symphony of tears
And brings you to eternal homes."

dropped a word to me today
said
you wrote a poem about me thanks
yesterday so
I wanted to explain myself
especially as they’re discussing me right now
in academic though wobbly drawn circles
the older guys say I’m a Concept
and therefore existed
before Shakespeare found a name for me, while
the younger guys
the So-Sures and the Deriders
say I’m merely a Signifier with
an uneasy relationship
with a Signified or
if you’re into that sort of abstruse joke,
a Significant Other
deep in myself
I’m One; that is,
an individual in one sense
but Everything, All One, in another theological
or philosophical or ontological sense
which feels pretty good,
a One without a Second
say the gurus
to illustrate my point
I’m writing this on the pommel of my saddle
riding the range out here where men are men
and no-one mentions that film;
Nashville on my i-pod,
Lonesome himself,
my chosen state of states,
the Iconic All-American
free as a wild mustang in the hills
though sometimes I’m just
Lonely
waiting for that ride into town and
the bar where everyone knows my name
and the barmaid says she waits for me alone
if it’s the third Thursday in the month
Lonesome. Lonely. Close.
That’s the West for you.
And someOne has to do the job.

Because of my affection for the divine aroma
Of the majestic spring,

She moves through my bittersweet memories
Which tenaciously cling
To her brown shoulder-length tresses,
Her happily excited laughter,
Her intelligent conversations,
Her pensive eyes concealing a sadness
That was never revealed to me.
Why should a man be haunted
By a beauty that was never his?
Why was my soul made so appropriately
For such lonely poetry?

When I’m all alone at sunset."

Please don't be shy.
Just tell me if its okay for me to dropp by.
I'll be the man you've always dreamed of.
I'll hold you close to me and show you love.
I'll help you through your pain and sorrow.
And after you wake up tomorrow,
We'll take a walk near the ocean shore.
As time goes by, I'll love you more and more."
2955,Emotion,LonelyPoemsLonelyLonelyPoembyDwayneEarleGordon,"Girlfriend, I'm so lonely
I love you and you love me
Girlfriend, I'm so lonely
Please come back, N be my baby
'Repeat Once'
These are the words I cry when my girl left me
I call her, and tell,
Listen, you are my baby
No matter what, you' re # 1 lady
I went to her house, and I tried to see her
Her mom came out, told me I was a dreamer
I didn't take it as a big deal
Because she don't know that my feelings is real
Dear girl, I will love you to the end
No matter what, you will be number one girlfriend."
2956,Emotion,LonelyPoemsAYoungMotherWaitsLonelyPoembyGaryBryson,"A young mother waits lonely,
But with war it didn’t start.
It began with a with a duty,
To country and heart.
With her husband at war,
Things are not as they seem.
Lonely days are without end,
Like its some kind of dream.
It seems even living,
Gets more difficult each day.
And in each daily letter.
Things are harder to say.
No more grand parades,
No excitement to bring.
Even so if there were,
It wouldn’t change a thing.
Alone with no husband,
No family and no friends,
Just another young mother,
Alone in the end.

2957,Emotion,LonelyPoemsTheLonelySoulWandersPoembydamienkai,"This is to show that despite people may feel lonely, they truly wallow in their own pity.How pathetic.
The lonely soul wanders
Alone in the walks of life
No other soul as his companion
The lonely soul wanders
Alone in the daybreak
He does his duties
In the walks of life
The lonely soul wanders
Alone in the life
He meets many other souls
Who come to be
Unfit for the lonely soul
The lonely soul wanders"
2958,Emotion,LonelyPoemsLonelyIsJustOneWordPoembyMaryHavran,"Lonely is just one word chosen to represent so much
To tell of feelings inside that the senses cannot touch
Lonely can be in the teardrops on a bereaved person’s cheek
Lonely can be in the silence of sorrows too deep to speak
Lonely can haunt a deserted room that Laughter once made proud
Lonely surrounds you when you’re alone or finds you in a crowd
Lonely is heard in echoed footsteps of a departing friend
Lonely penetrates the solitude of nights that will not end
Lonely will not listen to the pleadings of a broken heart
Lonely stays and torments until new Love shatters it apart"
2959,Emotion,LonelyPoemsLonelyYouLonelyIPoembyMarkRSlaughter,"You say you are lonely.
Are you? Come see MY solitary world.
I am lonely:
Not the ‘generally feeling lonely’ feeling –
You know, the ‘I need a cuddle 'cos I’m feeling a bit lonely today’ feeling;
Or the ‘I’m on my own today so I think I need to call up a friend’ feeling.
No, I mean the terror and depression of cold isolation;
That Black Hole of raw solitude;
The nadir you arrive at after a steady spiral downwards, inwards.
And suffocation by the blanket of social invisibility
Which insidiously greyed out your psyche without your knowing.
You know, when you alight on the platform of endless alcoholic days;
When you’re sprawled vacant and naked in the corner of your filthy room,
Oblivious to the scurrying life outside –
That which doesn’t acknowledge your existence anyway:
That’s lonely.

2960,Emotion,LonelyPoemsTheStrengthOfTheLonelyPoembyVachelLindsay,"(What the Mendicant Said )
The moon's a monk, unmated,
Who walks his cell, the sky.
His strength is that of heaven-vowed men
Who all life's flames defy.
They turn to stars or shadows,
They go like snow or dew—
Leaving behind no sorrow—
Only the arching blue."
2961,Emotion,LonelyPoemsYouReLonelyIMLonelyFromTheCompleteCollectedPoemsOfStrainsPoembyPeterSQuinn,"We are always coming lonely
And trying to be together
For you and you only
Are flickering like the weather
And dreams are too far away
To be of any reality
Like a morning that meets a day
Only to be in its company
The night is for both of us
Trying to find times thread
And trying to catch up with every loss
That comes to be with us instead
Like love that grows older
And catches us in our while
Time is its many folder
And every its timeless style
We are always coming to change
And letting the weather conclude
Every its beating blanches
That gives every season its mood
We cannot forget the crying
In the hours many singing tone
As this time's season is dying
And we again shall be alone"
2962,Emotion,LonelyPoemsLonelyChildPoembyShawnHenley,"Lonely child in the night.
Under heaven's golden lights.
I heard you cry near a stream.
Where maidens sing and sleep and dream.
Lonely child have no fear, the lord will dry your heart-
sick tears.
The night is young, a blue jay flies and whispers softly
please don't cry.
The lord above is free to roam he will help you from his
throne.
The lord loves you true and dear.
He only laughs he never swears.
Lonely child please don't run, beneath the sky, moon or sun.
You parents love you yes they do.
The clouds have dimmed, but no one knew.
Lonely child a lion prowls.
This lion is special he'd dare not bite.
He only hunts game in the wild never children o' lonely child.
Lonely child go back home, cross the deserts
where buffalo roamed.
The lord will lead you safe and clear.
So don't you cry nor shed a tear.
You parents miss your loving touch.
Your loving hugs and summer blush.
They miss the way you'd smile and grin.
You think they wouldn't you're only ten?
Lonely child in the night.
Your parents searched day and night.
For a child in the wild.
Their only son you lonely child.
Lonely child don't you cry.
And don't you dare tell a lie, on the lion in the wild.
He'd never hurt you lonely child.
Your parents love you very much.
So let them feel your loving touch.
Lonely child in the night.
A little dove flew, in fright.
I know you love your parents so.
So run and tell them let them know.
Let them know how you feel.
Let them know your love is real.
Lonely child run or fly.
Soar the heavens and the skies.
Soar the rivers and the streams.
Your smile will make the moonlight, beam.
Lonely child in the night, an angel, there's no need for fright."
2963,Emotion,LonelyPoemsYouWanderAsALonelyPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"Each day you wake up with a frown
Rumours keep spreading around town
That you’re suffering a mental breakdown
A solitary walk you walk
A lonely talk you talk
As you wander as a lonely
You wander as a lonely at night
You wander as a lonely on sight
You wander as a lonely at day
You wander as a lonely and pray
You wander as a lonely each day
Slow down, slow down
Shut down, shut down
Shutdown the lonely before you drown
Embrace your friends with warmth
They can give you assistance
Deliver you from your lonely existence
You keep fighting love
Bending it around like a curve
With your glowering face
Reserving only a lonely place,
Halting happiness to arrive in your life
Do you ever stop to wonder?
Do you ever stop to ponder?
Are you the reason for the lonely blunders?
Slow down, slow down
Shut down, shut down
Remove from your head that lonely crown
You wander endlessly as a lonely
Searching for a spot called homely
But your face is missing that vital smile called lovely

2964,Emotion,LonelyPoemsLonelyBurialPoembyStephenVincentBenet,"There were not many at that lonely place,
Where two scourged hills met in a little plain.
The wind cried loud in gusts, then low again.
Three pines strained darkly, runners in a race
Unseen by any. Toward the further woods
A dim harsh noise of voices rose and ceased.
-- We were most silent in those solitudes --
Then, sudden as a flame, the black-robed priest,
The clotted earth piled roughly up about
The hacked red oblong of the new-made thing,
Short words in swordlike Latin -- and a rout
Of dreams most impotent, unwearying.
Then, like a blind door shut on a carouse,
The terrible bareness of the soul's last house."
2965,Emotion,LonelyPoemsTooLonelyAndSadPoembyUriahHamilton,"When you become too lonely and sad,
That is when you disappear
Without a trace:
Ambrose Bierce became
A wandering ghost in Mexico;
Hart Crane, probably in tears,
Jumped into the ocean;
Sylvia Plath kissed her children
And then was no more.
So every day I’m singing one more hymn
And saying one more prayer,
I’m learning to weather storms.
I love Jesus,
But I don’t want to see him too soon."

I wish you company
When your sad
I wish you happiness

When all seems empty
I wish you hope."
2967,Emotion,LonelyPoemsLonelyForParisInSpringRhythmicon50LeadSheetsWithPoemsPoembyPeterSQuinn,"Lonely for Paris in spring
All is so faraway to reach,
A heart for joy could sing
What memories should teach;
Eyes are wide in clearing blue
All is such a joy to glide,
It's always up to me and you
What gets soft or amplified.
Be here and become strong
All has its wandering ways,
Have an opportunity get along
Make the best of all the days;
Ripe your feelings and touch
Nothing else is more of hope,
We have everything inasmuch
As we work things out and cope.
The days begin in nothingness
With the cold pleasure at first,
Then there might be a new fresh
A moment of thought we thirst;
A day is asleep for awhile
And then there's some awaken,
Hard in a lost hour to defile
When a mind's occupied or taken."
2968,Emotion,LonelyPoemsLikeCrusoeWalkingByTheLonelyStrandPoembyThomasBaileyAldrich,"Like Crusoe, walking by the lonely strand
And seeing a human footprint on the sand,
Have I this day been startled, finding here,
Set in brown mould, and delicately clear,
Spring's footprint--the first crocus of the year!
O sweet invasion! Farewell solitude!
Soon shall wild creatures of the field and wood
Flock from all sides with much ado and stir,
And make of me most willing prisoner!"

2971,Emotion,LonelyPoemsTheLonelyAngelPoembyJamesTaylor,"The lonely Angel cries to herself,
Her head is hung low and her body is still,
She calls out into to darkness and hears her voice echo,
But there is no one else in her empty world,
She locks herself in afraid of what might happen,
Closes the illusive curtains and shuts the door to her feelings,
Her beautiful face has grown old with crying,
The perfect smile painted on her lips has been wiped off,
And her dreams and aspirations have all been erased.
She waits patiently for her walls of solid emotion to tear,
Her cares are not for money, power or enlightenment,
Instead love and care is all that seeks,
Memories whispered gently into her ears is all she has for company,
She lays naked with no clothes to protect her,
Her prayers are always for a light to guide her,
A small crevice created by her hope lets warm air upon her,
She sometimes huddles against this unique warmth,
And she knows that if she lets go of hope she will be cold forever."
2972,Emotion,LonelyPoemsAHouseCalledLonelyATrilogyInThreePartsPoembysylviaspencer,"There is a street in every town that owns a house
called lonely. Then when your just passing by you might
just say, 'if only.
If only could mean a life time of thoughts but it does'nt cure
a lonely house and all its faults.
Boarded up windows and tiles gone from the roof, graffiti
painted by a rebelious youth.
Such a lonely house and an oh such a tired one,
one that has lost all it's fun.
Stairs and rafters all gone to pot all that is left
is wood worm and dry rot.
No children playing in the garden, it's just a house condemend
by the council without no pardon. Poor lonely house someones
forgotton dream, now describing lifes social scene.
This lonely house stands in the way because their building

Are the days gone by.
When others enter your life
Then you push them by.
O So Lonely
When you were in control.
To love them or leave them
You were ever so bold.
O So Lonely
While you sit alone.
No one is there
To make your house a home.
O So Lonely
After all the hearts you break.
Did you ever think it was you
Who you'd really forsake?
O So Lonely
When life was just a dare.
You didn't take time to love
You didn't try to care.
O So Lonely
Have you learned the rule?
That its not just about you
But it does take two.
O So Lonely
Why sit and contemplate?
While others enjoy life
Its never too late."
2974,Emotion,LonelyPoemsALonelyHeartInAThunderstormPoembysylviaspencer,"A lonely heart sets the table but is she a Milly,
a Betty or a Mabel. Tea, coffee, cakes and ale
but outside there blows a gale. Sash cord windows
rattling like chains, thunder and lighting tormenting her
brains. A frail old lady who always lays up for tea but no
one comes not even her family. As the rain pours down she
gives a little frown as she looks at a photo in her wedding
gown. A picture of love on her wedding day, a day she
never wanted to go away.Now all that's forgotton as the
clouds roll together, will her lonely heart stand up to this
gale force weather. She draws the curtains and says
goodnight to the storm then sits by the fire where its
cosy and warm.
No visitors tonight she says to the cat who lay curled up
on the fireside mat. Again she views her wedding day and
asks the Lord to show her the way.Then she holds the cat
to her lonely heart so that they will never be apart. The dear
old lady died that night and the cat now sits on her burial site."
2975,Emotion,LonelyPoemsAThoughtForALonelyDeathBedPoembyElizabethBarrettBrowning,"IF God compel thee to this destiny,
To die alone, with none beside thy bed
To ruffle round with sobs thy last word said
And mark with tears the pulses ebb from thee,--
Pray then alone, ' O Christ, come tenderly !
By thy forsaken Sonship in the red
Drear wine-press,--by the wilderness out-spread,--
And the lone garden where thine agony
Fell bloody from thy brow,--by all of those
Permitted desolations, comfort mine !
No earthly friend being near me, interpose
No deathly angel 'twixt my face aud thine,
But stoop Thyself to gather my life's rose,
And smile away my mortal to Divine ! '"
2976,Emotion,LonelyPoemsLonelyPoembyChloeSmith,"I stand alone in darkness,
A rose held in my hand,
The wind rustles in the trees,
As it sweeps across the land.
I wait for your arrival,
I hope it will be soon,
I want to dance with you again,
By the light of the silver moon.
And though you do not miss me,
I hope you won’t forget,
That the little girl you left alone,
Will grow stronger yet.
I hear your footsteps on the ground,
Have you come back for me?
You take the rose from my hands,
And throw it in the sea.
You sneer at me for waiting,
What a pathetic thing to do,
“How could you believe, ” you hiss at me,
“I’d love a thing like you? ”"

Misery always my only friend

or find my spark that has been dormant all these years
Is there somebody in this world who can see through the masks
and discover the beauty that this weary soul posseses
My heart is tired of the rigid solitude
my mind is ready for the sun that only Love can bring
but if this hopeless dream shall ever be fulfilled
only the spirits above seem to know."

That so many are in search of

When that day comes they won't toss it aside
The lonely they know and will cherish so
For only the lonely get it right
Love of so many descriptions
The art every part of the heart
Love when it comes to the lonely of one
They will hold on and believe not let it fall apart
I know that since I have found you
Somehow you reached out and found me
I know cause I know where it is I have been
The lonely has allowed me to believe
This thing that they do call love
This thing that so many are in search of
This thing that only the lonely they dream
I know, I once dreamed of your touch.

2980,Emotion,LonelyPoemsALonelyTravelerPoembyAlexanderRomanov,"Who will love a lonely traveler
Who traveled far & seeks some rest
I will, said the old tree
My leaves shall shade you from the sun
So you can sleep
And all your darkest secrets
For you I shall keep
Who will take pity in his heart
And who will feed a starving traveler
I will, said the serene lake
For in my unfathomable waters
I have plenty of fish
So eat & drink my friend
As much as you wish
Who will love a lonely traveler
And who will remember his name
I will, said the earth
For all I created returns on to me
From dust were you made
And dust you shall be"
2981,Emotion,LonelyPoemsTheLonelyGodPoembyJamesStephens,"So Eden was deserted, and at eve
Into the quiet place God came to grieve.
His face was sad, His hands hung slackly down
Along his robe; too sorrowful to frown
He paced along the grassy paths and through
The silent trees, and where the flowers grew
Tended by Adam. All the birds had gone
Out to the world, and singing was not one
To cheer the lonely God out of His grief --
The silence broken only when a leaf
Tapt lightly on a leaf, or when the wind,
Slow-handed, swayed the bushes to its mind.
And so along the base of a round hill,
Rolling in fern, He bent His way until
He neared the little hut which Adam made,
And saw its dusky rooftree overlaid
With greenest leaves. Here Adam and his spouse
Were wont to nestle in their little house
Snug at the dew-time: here He, standing sad,
Sighed with the wind, nor any pleasure had
In heavenly knowledge, for His darlings twain
Had gone from Him to learn the feel of pain,
And what was meant by sorrow and despair, --
Drear knowledge for a Father to prepare.
There he looked sadly on the little place;
A beehive round it was, without a trace
Of occupant or owner; standing dim
Among the gloomy trees it seemed to Him
A final desolation, the last word
Wherewith the lips of silence had been stirred.
Chaste and remote, so tiny and so shy,
So new withal, so lost to any eye,
So pac't of memories all innocent
Of days and nights that in it had been spent
In blithe communion, Adam, Eve, and He,
Afar from Heaven and its gaudery;
And now no more! He still must be the God
But not the friend; a Father with a rod
Whose voice was fear, whose countenance a threat,
Whose coming terror, and whose going wet
With penitential tears; not evermore
Would they run forth to meet Him as before
With careless laughter, striving each to be
First to His hand and dancing in their glee
To see Him coming -- they would hide instead
At His approach, or stand and hang the head,
Speaking in whispers, and would learn to pray
Instead of asking, 'Father, if we may.'
Never again to Eden would He haste
At cool of evening, when the sun had paced
Back from the tree-tops, slanting from the rim
Of a low cloud, what time the twilight dim
Knit tree to tree in shadow, gathering slow
Till all had met and vanished in the flow
Of dusky silence, and a brooding star
Stared at the growing darkness from afar,
While haply now and then some nested bird
Would lift upon the air a sleepy word
Most musical, or swing its airy bed
To the high moon that drifted overhead.
'Twas good to quit at evening His great throne,
To lay His crown aside, and all alone
Down through the quiet air to stoop and glide
Unkenned by angels: silently to hide
In the green fields, by dappled shades, where brooks
Through leafy solitudes and quiet nooks
Flowed far from heavenly majesty and pride,
From light astounding and the wheeling tide
Of roaring stars. Thus does it ever seem
Good to the best to stay aside and dream
In narrow places, where the hand can feel
Something beside, and know that it is real.
His angels! silly creatures who could sing
And sing again, and delicately fling
The smoky censer, bow and stand aside
All mute in adoration: thronging wide,
Till nowhere could He look but soon He saw
An angel bending humbly to the law
Mechanic; knowing nothing more of pain,
Than when they were forbid to sing again,
Or swing anew the censer, or bow down
In humble adoration of His frown.
This was the thought in Eden as He trod --
. . . It is a lonely thing to be a God.
So long! afar through Time He bent His mind,
For the beginning, which He could not find,
Through endless centuries and backwards still
Endless forever, till His 'stonied will
Halted in circles, dizzied in the swing
Of mazy nothingness. -- His mind could bring
Not to subjection, grip or hold the theme
Whose wide horizon melted like a dream
To thinnest edges. Infinite behind
The piling centuries were trodden blind
In gulfs chaotic -- so He could not see
When He was not who always had To Be.
Not even godly fortitude can stare
Into Eternity, nor easy bear
The insolent vacuity of Time:
It is too much, the mind can never climb
Up to its meaning, for, without an end,
Without beginning, plan, or scope, or trend
To point a path, there nothing is to hold
And steady surmise: so the mind is rolled
And swayed and drowned in dull Immensity.
Eternity outfaces even Me
With its indifference, and the fruitless year
Would swing as fruitless were I never there.
And so for ever, day and night the same,
Years flying swiftly nowhere, like a game
Played random by a madman, without end
Or any reasoned object but to spend
What is unspendable -- Eternal Woe!
O Weariness of Time that fast or slow
Goes never further, never has in view
An ending to the thing it seeks to do,
And so does nothing: merely ebb and flow,
From nowhere into nowhere, touching so
The shores of many stars and passing on,
Careless of what may come or what has gone.
O solitude unspeakable! to be
For ever with oneself! never see
An equal face, or feel an equal hand,
To sit in state and issue reprimand,
Admonishment or glory, and to smile
Disdaining what has happenèd the while!
O to be breast to breast against a foe!
Against a friend! to strive and not to know
The laboured outcome: love nor be aware
How much the other loved, and greatly care
With passion for that happy love or hate,
Nor know what joy or dole was hid in fate.
For I have ranged the spacy width and gone
Swift north and south, striving to look upon
An ending somewhere. Many days I sped
Hard to the west, a thousand years I fled
Eastwards in fury, but I could not find
The fringes of the Infinite. Behind
And yet behind, and ever at the end
Came new beginnings, paths that did not wend
To anywhere were there: and ever vast
And vaster spaces opened -- till at last
Dizzied with distance, thrilling to a pain
Unnameable, I turned to Heaven again.
And there My angels were prepared to fling
The cloudy incense, there prepared to sing
My praise and glory -- O, in fury I
Then roared them senseless, then threw down the sky
And stamped upon it, buffeted a star
With my great fist, and flung the sun afar:
Shouted My anger till the mighty sound
Rung to the width, frighting the furthest bound
And scope of hearing: tumult vaster still,
Throning the echo, dinned My ears, until
I fled in silence, seeking out a place
To hide Me from the very thought of Space.
And so, He thought, in Mine own Image I
Have made a man, remote from Heaven high
And all its humble angels: I have poured
My essence in his nostrils: I have cored
His heart with My own spirit; part of Me,
His mind with laboured growth unceasingly
Must strive to equal Mine; must ever grow
By virtue of My essence till he know
Both good and evil through the solemn test
Of sin and retribution, till, with zest,
He feels his godhead, soars to challenge Me
In Mine own Heaven for supremacy.
Through savage beasts and still more savage clay,
Invincible, I bid him fight a way
To greater battles, crawling through defeat
Into defeat again: ordained to meet
Disaster in disaster; prone to fall,
I prick him with My memory to call
Defiance at his victor and arise
With anguished fury to his greater size
Through tribulation, terror, and despair.
Astounded, he must fight to higher air,
Climb battle into battle till he be
Confronted with a flaming sword and Me.
So growing age by age to greater strength,
To greater beauty, skill and deep intent:
With wisdom wrung from pain, with energy
Nourished in sin and sorrow, he will be
Strong, pure and proud an enemy to meet,
Tremendous on a battle-field, or sweet
To walk by as friend with candid mind.
--Dear enemy or friend so hard to find,
I yet shall find you, yet shall put My breast
In enmity or love against your breast:
Shall smite or clasp with equal ecstasy
The enemy or friend who grows to Me.
The topmost blossom of his growing I
Shall take unto Me, cherish and lift high
Beside myself upon My holy throne: --
It is not good for God to be alone.
The perfect woman of his perfect race
Shall sit beside Me in the highest place
And be my Goddess, Queen, Companion, Wife,
The rounder of My majesty, the life
Of My ambition. She will smile to see
Me bending down to worship at her knee
Who never bent before, and she will say,
'Dear God, who was it taught Thee how to pray?""
And through eternity, adown the slope
Of never-ending time, compact of hope,
Of zest and young enjoyment, I and She
Will walk together, sowing jollity
Among the raving stars, and laughter through
The vacancies of Heaven, till the blue
Vast amplitudes of space lift up a song,
The echo of our presence, rolled along
And ever rolling where the planets sing
The majesty and glory of the King.
Then conquered, thou, Eternity, shalt lie
Under My hand as little as a fly.
I am the Master: I the mighty God
And you My workshop. Your pavilions trod
By Me and Mine shall never cease to be,
For you are but the magnitude of Me,
The width of My extension, the surround
Of My dense splendour. Rolling, rolling round,
To steeped infinity, and out beyond
My own strong comprehension, you are bond
And servile to My doings. Let you swing
More wide and ever wide, you do but fling
Around the instant Me, and measure still
The breadth and proportion of My Will.
Then stooping to the hut -- a beehive round --
God entered in and saw upon the ground
The dusty garland, Adam, (learned to weave)
Had loving placed upon the head of Eve
Before the terror came, when joyous they
Could look for God at closing of the day
Profound and happy. So the Mighty Guest
Rent, took, and placed the blossoms in His breast.
'This,' said He gently, 'I shall show My queen
When she hath grown to Me in space serene,
And say ""'twas worn by Eve.""' So, smiling fair,
He spread abroad His wings upon the air."
2982,Emotion,LonelyPoemsHowLonelyDoYouFeelPoembyVidushiKhera,"When times are bad and you have no friends
When the hopes of life lead to dead ends
When all your surroundings have nothing to give
And you can’t imagine life the way you live
When on your knees you bend and you kneel
How lonely do you feel?
When time goes by and you can’t keep pace
When the world laughs at your weary face
When all that you thought had belonged to you
Turns into trash, your happiness too
When life takes the fruit and leaves the peel
How lonely do you feel?
When all those things that once were yours
Go by like the ticking hours
When you’ve got nothing, no one to turn to
When all your people have betrayed you
When you are left with no joy, no zeal
How lonely do you feel?
When life is more of a terror than a test
When you get nothing though you try your best
When you are numb and you find not a wound healing
When you are a bird without any wings
When in the game of life you’ve lost the deal
How lonely do you feel?
When you find a person in such a state
Go up to him, do not wait
Let this question go on like a wheel
Ask him, “How lonely do you feel? ”"
2983,Emotion,LonelyPoemsLonelyNightPoembyBernardShaw,"A place by the fire in my old arm chair,
I am alone with no one my fire to share.
The crackling of logs burning bright,
Consoling me in my weary plight.
Shadows playing on ceiling and wall,
Ghosts past and present coming to call.
Outside the wind howls and moans.
Reminding me of my aching bones.
I am in the grip of melancholy deep,
Just past rendezvous I could not keep.
A fleeting glimpse of happiness long past,
With the echo's of words spoken too fast.
A candle in the window to light the way,
To any lost soul that wants to stay.
All are welcome to a place by my fire,
This is my wish my one desire.
Loneliness is what I fear most,
I am willing to play the welcoming host.
Come along guided by my candle's light,
And help me pass this lonely night"
2984,Emotion,LonelyPoemsLonelyEyesPoembyLeoLopes,"It doesn't matter how hard i try
Even though i'll be dyin inside
Look deep within and tell me what you find
I just can't seem to hide
These Lonely Eyes
They say nothing's harder than life
And those who live well are welcome in the sky
There's something wrong and i wanna take flight
I just can't seem to hide
These Lonely Eyes
Now that you're Gone Away i think i wanna die
I know you can see it, I'm surrounded by light
I tried to tell you i'm fine but that's a lie
I just can't seem to hide
These Lonely Eyes
As i see happy people go by
I'm so confused here, sometimes i wanna cry
I'm just a lonely soul lurkin in the lonely night
And i just can't seem to hide
These Lonely Eyes"
2985,Emotion,LonelyPoemsTheLonelyDeathPoembyAdelaideCrapsey,"In the cold I will rise, I will bathe
In waters of ice; myself
Will shiver, and shrive myself,
Alone in the dawn, and anoint
Forehead and feet and hands;
I will shutter the windows from light,
I will place in their sockets the four
Tall candles and set them aflame
In the grey of the dawn; and myself
Will lay myself straight in my bed,
And draw the sheet under my chin."
2986,Emotion,LonelyPoemsTheStarsGoOverTheLonelyOceanPoembyRobinsonJeffers,"Unhappy about some far off things
That are not my affair, wandering
Along the coast and up the lean ridges,
I saw in the evening
The stars go over the lonely ocean,
And a black-maned wild boar
Plowing with his snout on Mal Paso Mountain.
The old monster snuffled, ""Here are sweet roots,
Fat grubs, slick beetles and sprouted acorns.
The best nation in Europe has fallen,
And that is Finland,
But the stars go over the lonely ocean,""
The old black-bristled boar,
Tearing the sod on Mal Paso Mountain.
""The world's in a bad way, my man,
And bound to be worse before it mends;
Better lie up in the mountain here
Four or five centuries,
While the stars go over the lonely ocean,""
Said the old father of wild pigs,
Plowing the fallow on Mal Paso Mountain.
""Keep clear of the dupes that talk democracy
And the dogs that talk revolution,
Drunk with talk, liars and believers.
I believe in my tusks.
Long live freedom and damn the ideologies,""
Said the gamey black-maned boar
Tusking the turf on Mal Paso Mountain.

2988,Emotion,LonelyPoemsTheLonelyStreetPoembyWilliamCarlosWilliams,"School is over. It is too hot
to walk at ease. At ease
in light frocks they walk the streets
to while the time away.
They have grown tall. They hold
pink flames in their right hands.
In white from head to foot,
with sidelong, idle look--
in yellow, floating stuff,
black sash and stockings--
touching their avid mouths
with pink sugar on a stick--
like a carnation each holds in her hand--
they mount the lonely street."

2990,Emotion,FoodPoemsTasteOfFoodPoembyNaveedAkram,"In food is a certain quality of taste,
May they abstain and be erased.
For food manages my godly life,
Just as the fish manage with strife.
In this food, in that food we collapse
And honour a feast with some gaps.
The food we eat as dinner shall be kind
To the sleep we carry throughout the mind.
What food do you cook with expertise?
Fish and meat will certainly cease!"
2991,Emotion,FoodPoemsSonnetOnWastedFoodPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"The rotten mangoes that I threw away
Are spotted by a crow by early dawn;
By beak, he tastes them, flying on his way
To tell his friends about the food this morn!
Most birds eat almost anything they get;
Yet, they must search for food all life each day;
They must do this before the sun can set;
‘God feeds them daily’ – that’s what people say!
In tons, food wasted can feed millions still;
The heart to feed the hungry is not there;
And wasted drugs can be of use to ill;
Is there not space for all on ground or air?
All earthlings ought to toil for food and drink;
Yet grains go down the drains; food down the sink!"

Let us not waste this treasure
Let‘s be thankful for this pleasure

And it would do you good
I love food, I love food.

2994,Emotion,FoodPoemsFoodForThoughtPoembyMakarandParanjape,"The sky has darkened before its time:
a swarm of locusts,
not a thunder-storm.
To protect my tender crops
I build foolish fires,
burning everything handy.
The smoke drives some away,
kills some.  The rest descend.
Hosts of them camp in my head.
Frenzied, I run about,
stamping the earth with bare heels.
I shout, clapping bits of tin
to distract the devouring.
When there is a famine within
we shan't go completely hungry:
we'll heap all the dead words
and cook them.  It is said
they are delicious with rice and lentils.

2995,Emotion,FoodPoemsPeanutButterMyOldFriendpersonalFoodPoembyBriEdwards,"I had a peanut butter sandwich today
which made me think of all the way....
sssss my life has been touched by that
stick-to-your-mouth sludge of peanut fat.
Not 'touched' in the sense that it's shaped my life,
but  when I open a jar and take up a knife
or a spoon, I can picture times of enjoy-
ment as an adult consumer and as a boy.
Of course I'm lucky in that I generally enjoy food
even if I'm in a rare bad mood.
I assume pb was a common snack in my childhood,
though I'm not sure it was.  My memory is not that good.
But I do remember my Mom made cookies from it;
I helped her.  And the first cooled cookie I'm sure I bit,
paying some attention to the crisscross pattern on top,
or the sometimes-present big chocolate drop.
And when I visited my childhood neighbor, Helen, it's a good bet
that  sometimes a  peanut butter sandwich I would get.
[But I really better remember that Helen's kitchen at times had cake.
I assume her mother, Betty, the cake did make.]
At Halloween there were pb 'cups' made by Reeses.
Chocolate and pb.  It's good they were small pieces!
As an adult pb has been with me off and on.
Probably when I shared a home with my brother Don,
and when Shannon, my daughter, was young (that makes me smile) ,
and when I lived in a storage garage for a short while.
I used to put it on plain warm toast, but
perhaps mixed-with-vanilla-ice cream I enjoyed it most.
I can't tell you how it would taste on sliced tomato,
but I can say it wasn't good when tried on mashed potato! !
And as I type today there's an unsealed jar nearby.
My wife cautions me against too much, but I'm not sure why.
From time to time it's a treat on cereal or bread,
but usually it's just a spoon of it I stick into my head."
2996,Emotion,FoodPoemsSchoolsFoodPoembyElizabethWalker,"Yuck!  Gross!  I won't eat that
This food looks like a run over rat
It's green and gross, kind of icky,
It smells like a sewer and is really sticky
Nasty meat cooked half-way through
I think my face is turning blue
I think this bread is twelve years old.
The fries aren't cooked, they're still cold!"
2997,Emotion,FoodPoems3WillWorkForFoodPoembyMaryNagy,"I told my kids we'd see it, this movie, they couldn't wait.
We finally saved the money so we started on our ''date''.
They were so very happy to be on there way to see
this show that they'd been saving for even more than me.
Standing by the corner, he came into our view.
He looked so very helpless that I knew what we should do.
I tried to just look past him, to keep my spirits bright.
But, then I looked in the rearview mirror and knew what would be right.
The kids were looking also, they got quiet and so still.
My son's eyes looked so heavy as they simply began to fill.
He said ''Who needs a movie? There's good stuff on t.v.''
That's when I knew my kids would feel the pain of other's just like me.
As we gave this man the money, he looked me in the eye.
He blessed us all and watched us leave without saying goodbye.
His blessing was well worth it, I felt it in my soul.
I saw my kids' compassion shine and I've never felt so whole."
2998,Emotion,FoodPoemsSonnetMyFoodAllergyPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"And now and then, I taste the foods I shouldn't;
So stupidly in utter  disregard;
The things I loved to eat, some now I couldn't;
My allergy too has made me a Bard.
The sufferings that follow are so great;
I take the drugs to combat Allergy;
Of course, the symptoms do promptly abate;
But side-effects do steal my energy;
1 wish I had avoided the mistake;
I can’t be careful, all the time in life;
By miracle, if God-could only take,
Away the poison that adds to my strife.
Yet, blame I will myself for my sad plight;
How can a poison turn harmless o'er-night?"
2999,Emotion,FoodPoemsINeedSomeFoodPoembyGajananMishra,"I am in need of some food
After taking something
I will listen your love story.
I am in need of some food
After taking something
I will dance I will sing
O sun O moon O star O bird
For a moment stay there.
I am in need of some food
Food is the bare truth
If anythig is to love
Love food
Love is necessary for life
Food is necessary for
Life's maintenance.
I am in need of some food
Without food I can not
Do anything
There is no magic no power
Only there is hunger
Give me some food my dear
I love you then only
I can utter."

Men eat of it and die."
3001,Emotion,FoodPoemsFoodOhFoodPoembyRAVIKIRANARAKKAL,"I have been chasing that truck,
For 2kms, now and I will be dead
For the morsel the world cannot reach me,
Or the gods that cant make in my soil.
Why do these guys fight madly,
Brother to brother, friend to friend,
I and my type of folks live and die,
For the the beliefs and wrath
They carry, billions on arms are
Here to fight, but not a grain
To swallow, the land has become
Waterless and  dry, even the rivers
have flown away, as if scared of
Human madness, Oh food, food
When will you appear for our hungry
Souls, which sure will go to heavens,
Since our penance are over forever,
And our sins have beeen wahed away
For all the humanity by our hunngry stomachs."
3002,Emotion,FoodPoems3AFoodJunkiePoembyDavidThreadgold,"All through my life I’ve been tooing and froing
Constantly coming and constantly going
This way and that way without even knowing
Trying so hard till fatigue started showing
When I was younger I worked day and night
Bright as a button and feeling alright
Slim as a rake but without a great height
Now slightly broader with trousers to tight
When I look back without being rude
Avoiding the mirrors when dressed in the nude
Exhausted from toil whilst my sleeps still elude
I think it was all down to endless junk food

3003,Emotion,FoodPoemsSonnet75SoAreYouToMyThoughtsAsFoodToLifePoembyWilliamShakespeare,"So are you to my thoughts as food to life,
Or as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground;
And for the peace of you I hold such strife
As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found.
Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure;
Now counting best to be with you alone,
Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure;
Sometimes all full with feasting on your sight,
And by and by clean starvèd for a look;
Possessing or pursuing no delight
Save what is had, or must from you be took.
Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,
Or gluttoning on all, or all away."
3004,Emotion,FoodPoemsTheAngelFoodDogsPoembyAnneSexton,"Leaping, leaping, leaping,
down line by line,
growling at the cadavers,
filling the holy jugs with their piss,
falling into windows and mauling the parents,
but soft, kiss-soft,
and sobbing sobbing
into their awful dog dish.
No point? No twist for you
in my white tunnel?
Let me speak plainly,
let me whisper it from the podium-
Mother, may I use your pseudonym?
May I take the dove named Mary
and shove out Anne?
May I take my check book, my holographs,
my eight naked books,
and sign it Mary, Mary, Mary
full of grace?
I know my name is not offensive
but my feet hang in the noose.
I want to be white.
I want to be blue.
I want to be a bee digging into an onion heart,
as you did to me, dug and squatted
long after death and its fang.
Hail Mary, full of me,
Nibbling in the sitting room of my head.
Mary, Mary, virgin forever,
whore forever,
give me your name,
give me your mirror.
Boils fester in my soul,
so give me your name so I may kiss them,
and they will fly off,
nameless
but named,
and they will fly off like angel food dogs
with thee
and with thy spirit.
Let me climb the face of my kitchen dog
and fly off into my terrified years."

O my dear, You are my best food
Without chanting your name
I can not live a moment
Come to me with food
And provide strength
To my heart and lungs
And with you I am cheerful."
3006,Emotion,FoodPoemsOverweightWithFoodPoembyMarkRSlaughter,"Are you just a tub of lard and
Vastly overweight?
Do you think that when you die you'll
Need a piano crate
To act as coffin for your frame? -
Chosen as you die in shame, with
Only you to take the blame
For years of eating much the same:
A daily calorific fest
Gourmands of your ilk digest!
Is your heart in final fling and
Nearly set to burst?
Are your arteries bunged and clogged and
Feeling now the worst
For wear? - your aneurysm fit to blow
While blood as thick as rising dough
Cries 'Halt! ' to any hope of flow:
A dreadful state to put on show
In front of any nurse!
Best you hail a hearse.

from penning verse of many kinds

Some will keep to what’s held deep,
and only seek to reach our heart,
with kind, insightful, mystic art,
to sooth the soul and light the dark.
Or raise us up when life is blue,
or when were sick and off our food.
But if they would be well fed
they might resort to current news,
or stories with a twist of fate,
to mischief verse, or some debate,
on HIV or “the sovereign state”.

3014,Emotion,FoodPoemsFoodForThoughtPoembyLonnieHicks,"She hid it
but it became clear to her
even as a child
she was obsessed with food-
all the world and her relationships in it-
became things to be tasted;
consumed.
In her twenties she did not date men
she tasted them
and became bored
with them as one becomes
bored with the routine
of every day the same meal;
food was orgasmic to her
in its variety
but too,
this was  something she had to hide
because being that way also
had its guilty side;
all day long
she thought about what she would eat
that night
and the next day
or even reliving
a last  meal
re-tasting it in her mouth
it all seemed natural to her
because it seemed to her
others seemed to share as well
foods power.
It was a need to take
the outside in
to feel it in her mouth
swallow it down
tongue on texture
then a final act
of it resting inside her
as she digested it,
sometimes bulimically
to assuage  guilt
it being hidden heavings
in bathrooms, hers and those
of her friends
but always returning
to the need to fill up the Empty
to feel full
filled
to make it through some nights
eating
to assuage grief
sometimes to celebrate
often late at night secret eating
munching, ingesting
taking in
gorging on
cake and ice cream
chocolate
and potato chips
even beer
or liqueur
with exotic
items like mangos
and papayas
all carefully laid out before her
because she liked the ritual of it
the handing
the smells
the preparations and the cooking;
fork and spoon lifting high
to the altar of her mouth
to her wide lips
resting briefly upon her fiery tongue
to the savoring
the plunging onward
into the alimentary canal
to its final
warm resting place
inside.
And then the guilt
always the guilt
about what she had done
then on to the next day obsession about her  weight
the battle of the bulge
of the unwanted thickening sure to come
of the terrifying knowledge
her eating at night
it would show up
decorating her waist line
her hips,
her thighs
crime and punishment come alive
visible for all to see.
She reveled in her pregnancy
eating herself
to 51 additional pounds
and not losing all of them back
despite furious exercise;
ultimately welcoming mother hood
because cooking for her kids kept her in touch
with food
and after all
no mother
was expected to be thin;
and then escalator down
she gradually gave up
food had won
and she knew
that with advancing age
she could not lose back the years.
In despair, kids and husband now gone
she decided that it was not the food she'd been carving
all those years
rather it was a feeling of being filled up
being loved
food was just a poor substitute
And dear reader you ask what then?
She fell in love with a younger man
half her age
and he reciprocated.
the excitement of his loving her
made her feel for the first time in years
love
and gradually over a year
she lost the need for food
as a crutch.
More and more it became
for her a thing past.
Oh she did not  suddenly become a size two
but she did become a better her
more energy
and she needed that energy
becoming more and more thrilled
with whom she then was.
And yes, the two did last;
food not so much exiled
as becoming for her
only a once over-indulged
repast
from her past."
3015,Emotion,FoodPoemsNoFoodPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"Eyes do all that is needed
With due consideration point is conceded
But quest does not end in result
Sometimes hunger pushes more insult
I find horizon so log and vast
But happiness does not last
I have lot more to find
I can not afford to be kind
But what is happening?
Is it bad beginning?
I find no prey near the target
My eyes are tired but how to forget?
I shall fly higher
To get closer
To the object
And act
Some days prove futile
Yet efforts must go on for a while
I need to be more vigilant
And search them in plants
I shall go for search
And come down as such
Let me hope I succeed in the day
Find the delicious meal any way"

You keep sending your food back because you aren't satisfied.
If you send it back just once more, we are going to step outside.
You say that my food stinks but you don't realize that I'm a great chef.
My meals have caused food poisoning but they've caused no deaths.
You said that your bacon was burned and your eggs were runny.
I'm going to kick you in the crotch and you won't think it's funny.
You keep complaining about your meals, nobody likes a whiner.
You say that I cook worse than that chef who owned Mel's diner.
I'm getting pissed because of the meals that you return.
I hold the worlds record for food that causes heartburn."

Top chief on reality tv pack up your knives?
Where are best chiefs trained to thrive?
If best chief I wanted to be how would I plan?
By taking culinary as I had always planned.
In dedicated love to preparing cooking food.
Perhaps I might have finished
my associates in culinary arts
in San Francisco where I wanted
to sail into vibe city remembered
to wear a flower in my hair in hopes
of meeting very gentle people there.
Next to avoid that New York state of mind
I might have gone to Melbourne taking up
choice bachelor in culinary management.
For some fragile souls it’s just moving
getting used to standing up on own feet
walking into totally new environments.
The incredibly lucky retain parents support
financially in all aspects of love adored life.
The blessed cannot imagine how all those
who do not have parent support survive.
The truth many souls denied do not survive.
But you of sound mind good heart kind soul
you will be successful in whatever you do.
Imagine even among stress at highest levels

glorious extravagant egos you will want be
carried on one dream a beautiful restaurant
one day a beautiful dream in blessing taste.

3019,Emotion,FoodPoemsFoodPoembyDavidTaylor,"I’ve seen heart ache,
and I’ve seen pain.
I’ve seen love lost
never to be regained.
I write some poems,
to let you know.
This life lies between,
the rain above and fire below.
And through all that
the music of the poem flows.
Seasons come
and seasons go.
And dropp by drop
our understanding grows.
And when the crop of life
is ready, full, complete.
And the growing season
has reached a close.
The crop is harvested and
the finest parts put on display,
for your consumption day by day.
And when the tree is old
and has no more power
to give its fruits,
Its trunk and branches fall
returning to the ground
from whence they came.
To feed you all in another way,
through another crop, another day.
Its strange to find that I
am really growing day by day,
to feed you all until I meet,
the earth that’s always been
beneath my feet."

Our fine cuisine of world renown.

When QEII received her crown.
Oh how I need some fish ‘n chips;
I'll queue in pouring rain or snow!
What better way to warm my hands,
As soggy chips make fingers glow.
We Brits are famed for culinary finesse,
Like steak ‘n kidney pud no less;
Wondrous tripe; cottage pie;
Bangers and egg in lard to fry!
But fish ‘n chips - the crowning glory -
A dish to trounce the great kebab!
You think I care for chicken masala?
It's cod and chips that grow my flab.
Oh how I yearn for fish ‘n chips,
All poshly wrapped in the Daily Star,
Then caked and drowned in salt ‘n vinegar -
And stinking out my brand new car!

People say go on a diet, but what do they know.
Food, food you make me grow,
You are the one on that makes me glow.
Burgers and fries,
They are the one that stifles my hunger cries.
Popcorn chicken and buffalo wings,
Whenever I see you, with joy my heart sings.
Smoothies and milkshake,
They all go great with a nice chocolate cake.
Ice cream and whip cream,
Why couldn’t I get you out of my dream?
Food, food I love you so.
I will always love you wherever I go.
Food, food you may not know,
But in my life, you play the leading role."

You are infinite

Supplied to me
Only by you

this food looks like a run over rat
it’s green and gross, kind of icky,
it smells like a sewer and is really sticky.
Nasty meat cooked half-way through

I think this soup is twelve years old.

We know the school isn’t rich,
But they can’t give us cold dish."
3028,Emotion,FoodPoemsSlavesOfFoodPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"Thick red blood veins bath in anger
The stomach grumbles in idiotic anger
A taste of food and out springs laughter
Triumphant moods commence again after
And it can be argued
We are all but slaves of food
Digesting away between interludes
Without food the mind is wholly screwed
We consume and wear different costumes
With food for thought and food of all sorts
We eat for the heart until it sets us apart
While the crumbs are often sought by rats
The pleasure one feels after a congested meal
That inner gratifying satisfaction is cheap but real
Toast, eggs and beans and it is work and work
Fruits, wine and cakes and it is talk and talk
Coffee or tea and eyes are conspicuously awake
A turkey roast and sleep is suspiciously at stake
We are all but slaves of food
I conclude with fluctuating moods
There is food for romance
There is food for the fools
Enjoy, eat fast, food never lasts, rewind and preview
Hungry mouths elsewhere regularly wait for its rescue

3029,Emotion,FoodPoemsLittleDillPicklesfoodNatureImaginationPersonalPoembyBriEdwards,"I just grabbed a long-handled spoon.....
to scoop little pickles from a jar.
While looking at them swimming in jar's brine,
I had a thought I thought was bizarre.
Once in Georgia at a big swamp's edge,
an alligator in a ditch I taunted.
Tonight those pickles WERE alligators..... I pledge!
Well NOT really, but there was resemblance.
I imagined looking down at a pool of ‘gators,
with no heads, nor legs, nor tips of tail.
[as penguins resemble tuxedoed-waiters]

My stomachs growling to be fed,
This is no quiet mute appeal
refuses to be quieted.
Nouveau cuisine just will not do
no pretty pictures on a plate
I really need something to chew

My stomach clearly understands
exactly what it wants and needs
Expects me to obey its commands
and as always it succeeds.
A T bone steak with some French fries
My stomach usually satisfies."
3031,Emotion,FoodPoemsFoodHabitsPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"Old habits die hard
We only live in present and don't look forward
Live with junk food and rotten ideas
All our advice fall on dear ears with no regard to pleas
We are prepared to live with all diseases
No matter even if life comes to stand still or ceases
We will follow new trend with hectic life and tension
Please don’t advise us in matter with confusion
This is what new generation thinks!
Very shortly their life boat sinks
So much tension and no way out
This is life style and whole story about
Nothing is attained out of this habit
There is no strength left in feet
They crumble with little more weight
Only wait for instant result without fight
Nobody is willing to wait for a second
Even though some of the things may be beyond
We try with half willingness and less determination
It is not likely to grow any fruitful relation
Good food habits leads to culmination of good thoughts
Many successes are had without external help being sought
It calm downs the eagerness and stream into real strategy
The less time will be spent even after remaining so much busy"

3034,Emotion,FoodPoemsFishFoodAnObituaryToHartCranePoembyJohnBrooksWheelwright,"As you drank deep as Thor, did you think of milk or wine?
Did you drink blood, while you drank the salt deep?
Or see through the film of light, that sharpened your rage with its stare,
a shark, dolphin, turtle? Did you not see the Cat
who, when Thor lifted her, unbased the cubic ground?
You would drain fathomless flagons to be slaked with vacuum-
The sea's teats have suckled you, and you are sunk far
in bubble-dreams, under swaying translucent vines
of thundering interior wonder. Eagles can never now
carry parts of your body, over cupped mountains
as emblems of their anger, embers to fire self-hate
to other wonders, unfolding white, flaming vistas.
Fishes now look upon you, with eyes which do not gossip.
Fishes are never shocked. Fishes will kiss you, each
fish tweak you; every kiss take bits of you away,
till your bones alone will roll, with the Gulf Stream's swell.
So has it been already, so have the carpers and puffers
nibbled your carcass of fame, each to his liking. Now
in tides of noon, the bones of your thought-suspended structures
gleam as you intended. Noon pulled your eyes with small
magnetic headaches; the will seeped from your blood. Seeds
of meaning popped from the pods of thought. And you fall. And the unseen
churn of Time changes the pearl-hued ocean;
like a pearl-shaped drop, in a huge water-clock
falling; from came to go, from come to went. And you fell.
Waters received you. Waters of our Birth in Death dissolve you.
Now you have willed it, may the Great Wash take you.
As the Mother-Lover takes your woe away, and cleansing
grief and you away, you sleep, you do not snore.
Lie still. Your rage is gone on a bright flood
away; as, when a bad friend held out his hand
you said, 'Do not talk any more. I know you meant no harm.'
What was the soil whence your anger sprang, who are deaf
as the stones to the whispering flight of the Mississippi's rivers?
What did you see as you fell? What did you hear as you sank?
Did it make you drunken with hearing?
I will not ask any more. You saw or heard no evil."

After having created in a few days
What is good and what is not, God
Created in heaven, or in its whereabouts,
A hook, and hung a piece of ham to it.
He said: ""The woman who during her whole life
Has not been unfaithful to her husband
Will receive a slice, to be eaten with
The heavenly bread of our bakehouse"".
Eve died, Leah died, Rebecca died [2] ,
Little by little, up to your wife,
All of them passed away, every single one.
And each of them, knife in hand,

After six thousand years that piece of ham is untouched."

Why they didn’t see...

Food cooked outside in the open air
Grilled and pan-fried food on the menu
For all the ranch hands to share
They cooked in all kinds of weather
Eaten by cowboys and cowgirls as well
What a rustic way to live and to eat
Many stories those Chuck Wagons could tell
Kinda gives me chills to observe
Pictures and postcards from back then
And of course we all have in the past
Many Chuck Wagon folks were our kin
Today, you know, they have contests
All cook that Chuck Wagon food
The smoky smells waft through the air
Sure puts you in a hungry mood
So if you get a chance some time
To enjoy a delicious Chuck Wagon meal
I know you’ll love every moment and bite
Outdoors with a down-home country feel!"

Before pizza ruined Scandinavian cuisine it was wholesome,

to be a simple science about feeding people good food, this is
no longer so as we are full, need not eat the usual to survive,
that is why food has become degeneration an entertainment
for the rich who do no longer see food as survival for the hard
working but as a sort of enjoyment for the jaded palate.
But I was walking around Oslo´s bleak streets I came across
a place called “Bondeheimen” they had meat cakes with boiled

It was built to withstand disaster natural and unnatural,

From around the world to have some food in case disaster strikes,
Enough for Morlocks and enough for the Eloi,
But are they forgetting the bees?

Ah! nevermore! for all the child might crave!
Ah! nevermore! through years unkind and dreary!
Often of other fare my lips are weary,
Unwearied once of what thy bosom gave.
(Poor wordless mouth that could not speak thy name!
At what unhappy revels has it eaten
The viands that no memory can sweeten, --
The banquet found eternally the same!)
Then fell a shadow first on thee and me,
And tendrils broke that held us two how dearly!
Once infinitely thine, then hourly, yearly,
Less thine, as less the worthy thine to be.
(O mouth that yet should kiss the mouth of Sin!
Were lies so sweet, now bitter to remember?
Slow sinks the flame unfaithful to an ember;
New beauty fades and passion's wine is thin.)
How poor an end of that solicitude
And all the love I had not from another!
Peace to thine unforgetting heart, O Mother,
Who gav'st the dear and unremembered food!"

Of pure heart
I know man is
What he eats.
I want some food."
3065,Emotion,FoodPoemsFoodForThoughtPoembyivororivorehogg,"The fields are bare, the harvest safe in store
Now is the time for man and beast to rest
King winter will enforce his frigid rule.
The fields are white, the harvest safe in store
In time the sun will shine and spring return
The earth will show renewed vitality
When sunshine puts an end to winters reign,
the frost retreats to let the spring return.
The farmers and the peasants know the score.
The city folk are merely parasites
who do not know nor want to know the score.
They are convinced they do not need to learn.
Confident that gold can buy anything,
this is not true. When famine strikes they’ll learn."

Your food says
What are you.
Take food, and

3071,Emotion,FoodPoemsAmericasUsingFoodStampsPoembyLindaWinchell,"Seems most of Americans are now using food stamps
maybe for the first time in their lives?
Our economy is hurting badly
people are going to extremes, just to stay alive!
Retail thefts are rising!
Better be home if a package is dropped off at your door!
Because when you get home from work one day
it might not be there anymore!
People cutting down Christmas trees
from their neighbors very back yards!
Times are tough, I've experienced it already!
but we haven't taken what wasn't ours!
I think they're are some going overboard!
It isn't that bad, not really just yet!
But wait awhile and I'm sure my friend
then where will be our Governments safety net?
They're all using our tax payers money!
For those who haven't or never have paid any!
But they're all in line, waiting for their checks!
while working off the sweat of us who work for pennies!
Instead of bailing the Auto Industry out!
Give all new tax payers, a new car purchased tax break!
This will solve the problem they say they're having!
and save them all from filing bankruptcy
or that mental section eight!"
3072,Emotion,FoodPoemsFoodPoembyCPSharma,"O Food, your glory is so great,
Strength of limbs you generate.
It should be of our own choice,
Or with guileless friends rejoice.
O delicious, sweet luscious food,
Come; see all health it includes.
All guile and ill health elude,
Keep away bad mood & feud.
Nature everywhere food provides:
In plains, on plateau and hill sides.
Just as wind blows everywhere,
Savory juices all over supplies.
Food for creatures of all types,
Of high, low neck and stripe
As the food Nature assigns,
Teeth, beak & mouth design.
O food, you boost great gods’ spirit,
Morale of the brave you ever uplift.
Helped to kill nefarious Dragon,
Glorious victory over it was won.
The juices of watery food fresh,
Dissolve all superfluous flesh.
Milk & grain protect the frame,
So as I muscular power claim.
Creation, around food galvanized,
Ever wraps up and rematerialize.
Note: Inspired by Rig Veda (1/187)"

3074,Emotion,FoodPoemsFoodForTheWombWoundedPoembyLovitaJRMorang,"There he is like the ocean
Holding an empty shell
Empty shell filled with
God's food
That every lovable things on earth would live
a day more to taste.
It's not the food you eat has love
It's not love you have is adored
Palate of life
We mix it with pain and pleasure.
Tears, sweat, blood…
all ooze out from the vein of Hard work…
How can things unseen and invisible
Can be so true
Can be so rooted
here I see this beautiful earth
everything merged through these invisible forces
like a blind man see the colours of life
and weave his own colour…
red through green, green through blue
burns the angst for not being able to see…
but creates these are the colours he creates…
and lay before us the senses to feel…
Blooming into every man's beauty
Farer man sing evening songs
We wait for another morning…
I licked through the plate of food
Gulping down my thirst and hunger
Just like a hungry begging human on street
I lived for the food that comes from some distant land
And an unknown lover make it
And an unknown lover taste it
A fistful of food…
Opens her empty hands
She lives
She learns to live
She learns to eat
The passion of eating through
What I yearn to see one day
Your hands feeding a hungry mother
In the corner of a silenced street.
Cuddling the child of love
Heals a mother's womb wounded by hunger of love
Here he is like the wonderful ocean…
Holding the empty shell
Emptiness shall be filled with
God's food.

3075,Emotion,FoodPoemsFoodForThoughtPoembyERNESTCLARY,"As we graze upon reality
is there something we dont see
while I sit and take a glance
I wonder if its all by chance
do this life we guide from the helm
or is it set by another realm
can we change the path we take
or are we earthen bound like a lake
looking beyond this life I live
is there more I can take or give
I guess I, m searching for a gate
as I ponder upon my fate
is there something i can do
to make life better for me and you
so far nothing I have found
can unlock this chain that has us bound
I have grown old and weak
still the answer I have seek
is there something that I ought
or is it all just food for thought"

It is all that we need
It is all that we need
to calm down our spirits!
It is food that fills
that fills the empty pangs
of our stomachs,
pangs that make us yawn
but cannot sleep
that make us gulp
but cannot vomit,
that make our saliva
taste sour and acidic!
We cry for food
like the helpless little children
with the art to attract attention
by our street demonstrations.
Yes, we cry for food like little children
to calm down our spirits,
that the cry cannot at all be neglected
for it is food,
it is food that soothes our spirits.
But you give us bullets
on the streets where we stage
our cry for food
You give us bullets
instead of food.
But even bullets cannot silence
our cry for food
for as long as we`re hungry
we shall be like little children
that will ever cry for food."

He did something that was really bizarre.
He ate canned dog food everyday.

He had no family, he was all alone.
I wish he could've afforded better food.
I hope that his life has improved."

Millions of babies formed, born, grown and give birth,
We are the tough species to conquer any other species,
We have come a long way not to make it a short exit,
Let us celebrate our victory with the mother earth,
Where her treasure are being stolen for our mirth,
Diamond cuts a diamond; a heart wounds a heart,
We, human, hurt our fellow human for our greed,
Millions roam on the urban jungle for the food,
Millions throw the food into the bin as a fad."

And the food of her love was fully prepared for me only."

3087,Emotion,FoodPoemsTheFoodOfLovePoembyErnestineNorthover,"What would you like for supper,
Some steak, with chips and peas,
Maybe, a nice brewed cuppa,
Or me, with lips that please.
You could have something spicy,
Like a curry or sweet and sour,
But these can be a bit spicy
And not good, at this late hour.
Perhaps a glass of beer, or shandy,
Or a brandy to fill the gap,
But, of course, that might make you randy,
Hey! Have that as your nightcap!
There's me, I'm sweet and slender,
And tender like the steak,
And if you put me in a blender,
A fantastic meal, I'd make.
There's food enough for your pleasure,
So don't say you aren't well fed,
When you start to realise I'm a treasure,
You could have 'hot crumpet' in your bed!

I have no stomach for such meat.
In little light and narrow room,
They eat it in the silent tomb,
With no kind voice of comrade near
To bid the banquet be of cheer.
But Friendship is a nobler thing,-
Of Friendship it is good to sing.
For truly, when a man shall end,
He lives in memory of his friend,
Who doth his better part recall,
And of his faults make funeral."
3090,Emotion,HairPoemsWillSomeoneHoldMyHairPoembylillymandrell,"Go ahead and buy yourself a drink
A few more, and the pain will ease.
As you kneel before the porcelain God
Ask yourself if it was worth it.

Worth the six hour hangover?
And besides, it was only a figment of your imagination
You were never really at peaces with yourself.
It was just a drunken blur
The pain was always there."
3091,Emotion,HairPoemsWithinTheStringsOfHisHairPoembyARBrixton,"Chords of the most beautiful song,
With my eyes, tracing the prominent
Vein that followed the course of his arm,
Round and round, over and once again,
In love, from the whole painting
To the small details and the even smaller
Obscure signature like a mark or a sign
Kept hidden, yet so visible.
For eyes that do not see what I see,
Will never find the perfect melody
I played mentally, while running
Long fingers and polished fingernails
Through those strings of His hair.
The moment, only created by a sudden
Bolt of beauty that dear Helios
Wished upon and for, for me
Can I only say thank you?
Such rays, soon soon they were gone;
I have but to ask the gods one more
Precious treasure by their hands given.
Eros, beloved Eros, have my heart as long
As his becomes mine, for I do not mind
just so I could render my song.
A tune for my heart; Oh let his youth
Be forever, diamond like;
So will my devotion to Thee.
For a whole minute, the whole world
All the unbelievable forces that we dare
Deny the existence of, re-arranged time
And life to, in a whole minute,
Replace my widowing heart and soul
And create the most sublime
Single measurement of time
That will forever and ever, eternally
Remind me of how gold and bold
Love can be."

3093,Emotion,HairPoemsAGirlWithBlueGreenHairPoembyMaryRyan,"One Sunday morning I hurried on my way
And I arrived at my church ready to worship and pray
Then I saw a girl with blue-green hair
She walked away, not welcome there
I could see the tears falling down her face
I realized that I didn’t want to be in such a place
I looked at myself in my dress so neat
And then at the girl in her jeans and dusty bare feet
“Don’t be sad because you were turned away
We’ll find us a church where we both can stay”
With a smile on my face, I took her hand
And we both walked away from my church so grand
Soon a small wooden building I chanced to see
A young man smiled and greeted both her and me
The doors I saw were thrown open wide
“There’s a place for you both just right inside”
So many different people all worshipping the Lord
And the truth being preached straight from His Word
A place was found for us side by side
Welcomed by His love that we often hide
Let all church doors be thrown open wide
And all who approach be welcomed inside
Whether it be a woman with a refined air
Or a barefoot girl with blue-green hair"
3094,Emotion,HairPoemsDoEarwigsHaveHairPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"An earwig, brown and also shiny
sat on a river bank, alone.
Compared to others he was tiny,
a critter made of skin and bone.
This mission's solitary aim
was simply to elucidate
his role in God's creation game,
to find himself, at any rate.
For many long and lonely hours
he stared into the stream's reflection.
Half sitting in a sea of flowers,
a specimen of weird perfection.
And when the Moon arrived at last,
dead shadows out to find their prey,
the little guy crawled very fast
into a giant stack of hay.
His intricate, but feeble mind
was at a loss as much as ever,
his image, front  and from behind
did look presentable, but never
would he resemble to keen eyes
a hairless critter, plain and nude,
and to this day he does despise
the  EARWIG  name as rather crude."
3095,Emotion,HairPoemsAPinHasAHeadButHasNoHairPoembyChristinaGeorginaRossetti,"A pin has a head, but has no hair;
A clock has a face, but no mouth there;
Needles have eyes, but they cannot see;
A fly has a trunk without lock or key;
A timepiece may lose, but cannot win;
A corn-field dimples without a chin;
A hill has no leg, but has a foot;
A wine-glass a stem, but not a root;
A watch has hands, but no thumb or finger;
A boot has a tongue, but is no singer;
Rivers run, though they have no feet;
A saw has teeth, but it does not eat;
Ash-trees have keys, yet never a lock;
And baby crows, without being a cock."

Now caresses the casement its lovely shoots
Starry flowers glow in twilight green
Dance in breeze and in dew they preen
The Jasmeen tree fragrance’s tender lore
Whispering perfumes to yonder shores
Hark! How envy grows out of its roots
Ringlets and threads like ropes brute
Malicious tresses wrap all around
Beauty so green is viciously confound
Pearly flowers tangled in raven hair
But who can capture the maiden so fair
She still stands tall in her turret bower
Laughing in sunshine glowing in shower
Necking birds and gemming flowers
Swing on boughs for hearts a dower
Poison of love wine outdone by balmy tower
Incensed symphony does float on air
Heaving through strangling weed’s snare"

Has pale glows and blond dullness;
Your gaze has the blue of ether and waves;
Your gown has the chill of the breeze and the woods.
I burn the whiteness of your fingers with kisses.
The night air spreads the dust from many worlds.
Still I don't know anymore, in the heart of those deep nights,
How to see you with the passion of yesterday.
The moon grazed you with a slanted glow ...
It was terrible, like prophetic lightning
Revealing the hideous below your beauty.
I saw-as one sees a flower fade-
On your mouth, like summer auroras,
The withered smile of an old whore."
3099,Emotion,HairPoemsLittleSleepsHeadSproutingHairInTheMoonlightPoembyGalwayKinnell,"1
You scream, waking from a nightmare.
When I sleepwalk
into your room, and pick you up,
and hold you up in the moonlight, you cling to me
hard,
as if clinging could save us. I think
you think
I will never die, I think I exude
to you the permanence of smoke or stars,
even as
my broken arms heal themselves around you.
2
I have heard you tell
the sun, don't go down, I have stood by
as you told the flower, don't grow old,
don't die. Little Maud,
I would blow the flame out of your silver cup,
I would suck the rot from your fingernail,
I would brush your sprouting hair of the dying light,
I would scrape the rust off your ivory bones,
I would help death escape through the little ribs of your body,
I would alchemize the ashes of your cradle back into wood,
I would let nothing of you go, ever,
until washerwomen
feel the clothes fall asleep in their hands,
and hens scratch their spell across hatchet blades,
and rats walk away from the cultures of the plague,
and iron twists weapons toward the true north,
and grease refuses to slide in the machinery of progress,
and men feel as free on earth as fleas on the bodies of men,
and lovers no longer whisper to the presence beside them in the
dark, O corpse-to-be ...
And yet perhaps this is the reason you cry,
this the nightmare you wake screaming from:
being forever
in the pre-trembling of a house that falls.
3
In a restaurant once, everyone
quietly eating, you clambered up
on my lap: to all
the mouthfuls rising toward
all the mouths, at the top of your voice
you cried
your one word, caca! caca! caca!
and each spoonful
stopped, a moment, in midair, in its withering
steam.
Yes,
you cling because
I, like you, only sooner
than you, will go down
the path of vanished alphabets,
the roadlessness
to the other side of the darkness,
your arms
like the shoes left behind,
like the adjectives in the halting speech
of old men,
which once could call up the lost nouns.
4
And you yourself,
some impossible Tuesday
in the year Two Thousand and Nine, will walk out
among the black stones
of the field, in the rain,
and the stones saying
over their one word, ci-gît, ci-gît, ci-gît,
and the raindrops
hitting you on the fontanel
over and over, and you standing there
unable to let them in.
5
If one day it happens
you find yourself with someone you love
in a café at one end
of the Pont Mirabeau, at the zinc bar
where white wine stands in upward opening glasses,
and if you commit then, as we did, the error
of thinking,
one day all this will only be memory,
learn,
as you stand
at this end of the bridge which arcs,
from love, you think, into enduring love,
learn to reach deeper
into the sorrows
to come – to touch
the almost imaginary bones
under the face, to hear under the laughter
the wind crying across the black stones. Kiss
the mouth
which tells you, here,
here is the world. This mouth. This laughter. These temple bones.
The still undanced cadence of vanishing.
6
In the light the moon
sends back, I can see in your eyes
the hand that waved once
in my father's eyes, a tiny kite
wobbling far up in the twilight of his last look:
and the angel
of all mortal things lets go the string.
7
Back you go, into your crib.
The last blackbird lights up his gold wings: farewell.
Your eyes close inside your head,
in sleep. Already
in your dreams the hours begin to sing.
Little sleep's-head sprouting hair in the moonlight,
when I come back
we will go out together,
we will walk out together among
the ten thousand things,
each scratched too late with such knowledge, the wages
of dying is love."
3100,Emotion,HairPoemsHairLessPoembynaidasupnet,"(I have always dreamed to be bald since I was younger. But there are some things which are stopping me. But this I promise myself, I will really fulfil it sometime soon. Hope you enjoy my short poem.)
I want to cut my hair
Till I only see the skin
I want to walk and run
And feel my hair is gone
It's been a long time dream
To do it But it seems
My guts are getting low
To be so bald, you know
But this I told myself
Before my time is done
I'll cut my hair away
And find out what I say
For I think it is nice
To feel what is not there
I want to be HANDSOME
Even for  short a time."

Often a woman drifts off down her long hair and is lost"
3102,Emotion,HairPoemsRefugiosHairPoembyAlbertoRíos,"In the old days of our family,
My grandmother was a young woman
Whose hair was as long as the river.
She lived with her sisters on the ranch
La Calera--The Land of the Lime--
And her days were happy.
But her uncle Carlos lived there too,
Carlos whose soul had the edge of a knife.
One day, to teach her to ride a horse,
He made her climb on the fastest one,
Bareback, and sit there
As he held its long face in his arms.
And then he did the unspeakable deed
For which he would always be remembered:
He called for the handsome baby Pirrín
And he placed the child in her arms.
With that picture of a Madonna on horseback
He slapped the shank of the horse's rear leg.
The horse did what a horse must,
Racing full toward the bright horizon.
But first he ran under the álamo trees
To rid his back of this unfair weight:
This woman full of tears
And this baby full of love.
When they reached the trees and went under,
Her hair, which had trailed her,
Equal in its magnificence to the tail of the horse,
That hair rose up and flew into the branches
As if it were a thousand arms,
All of them trying to save her.
The horse ran off and left her,
The baby still in her arms,
The two of them hanging from her hair.
The baby looked only at her
And did not cry, so steady was her cradle.
Her sisters came running to save them.
But the hair would not let go.
From its fear it held on and had to be cut,
All of it, from her head.
From that day on, my grandmother
Wore her hair short like a scream,
But it was long like a river in her sleep."
3103,Emotion,HairPoemsBrushingYourHairPoembyUriahHamilton,"When I’m lonely
And feel like
Cashing in my chips,
When I’m melancholy
Beneath autumn street lights,
When my voice quivers
Talking about you
With a friend,
I know, I’d still
Fall in love with you again
If only I could
See you on the beach
Or brushing your hair
Before a mirror."

(From the Musical 'Hair')
Hair today, gone tomorrow,
A lock of John Lennon’s hair was sold at auction.
But what I would ask is how sure it is John’s at all?
Did CSI London extract the DNA?
Did the dream team of OJ affirm that it was or wasn’t?
If the locket of hair doesn’t fit, you must acquit.
John’s body was cremated but there are his sons.
What if the sons gave the hair?
Seems to be a hairy question to me?
What about Prince Harry’s hair?
Is the auction price going to more than John’s?
Hair, There and Everywhere.
The hair styles that Beatles wore evoked certain level of social change,
Not to mention that John recognized,
-at rightfully so, - later on so not!
The Beatles were more popular than Christ,
-and of all his hair.
If a single Christ hair were to be found,
A single hair of the Lord would fetch more than John’s lock.

3106,Emotion,HairPoemsTheRustlingOfHairGrassPoembyJurgisBaltrušaitis,"Greet the tender grassblades by your path, and listen
While the clay-sprung grass that's fine as hair will whisper,
Whisper to your heart, which seems so hard of hearing,
'You and I, to time eternity, are equal...'
For Almighty Father God has so arranged that,
Since you both accepted as your destination
Modest earth, you're halves of an equation: riddles
Both: in bloom and ashes, comparable miracles...
Catch this living knowledge, let your eyes be opened,
And from then on you will draw your dwindling moment
From forever – and not have to split the empire
Of the world to muddy earth and starry heaven..."
3107,Emotion,HairPoemsSonnet18INeverGaveALockOfHairAwayPoembyElizabethBarrettBrowning,"XVIII
I never gave a lock of hair away
To a man, Dearest, except this to thee,
Which now upon my fingers thoughtfully,
I ring out to the full brown length and say
'Take it.' My day of youth went yesterday;
My hair no longer bounds to my foot's glee,
Nor plant I it from rose or myrtle-tree,
As girls do, any more: it only may
Now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears,
Taught drooping from the head that hangs aside
Through sorrow's trick. I thought the funeral-shears
Would take this first, but Love is justified,—
Take it thou,—finding pure, from all those years,
The kiss my mother left here when she died."
3108,Emotion,HairPoemsAnOdeToAnOldGreyHairPoembySidiJMahtrow,"Once you were the Queen of the fairways
Striding along ahead of the pack
Club in hand, eye on the ball
As you with deft stroke played the game.
Time wears away the luster
Of past dreams and lays bare
The fact that Aging is not for Sissies
But for those who persevere.
As the shadows grew long
The shine of your sun-bleached tresses
Dimmed as they grew thin
But memory carried you through.
The hopes and joys of youth
May have faded
But you, although bent by time
Continued to follow a dream.
How much you contributed
To those who follow in your footsteps
Remains to be seen
As they have not the vision of the future
That your generation shared.
Disillusions did not dissuade you
False prophets did not mislead you
Scarcity did cause you to want
Mockery did not bow your head.
Oh, Grey Hair, how we miss you
How we think often of you
How we remember your firm hand
Your gentle encouragement."

A fellow poet(well, it wasn't a fella)       divulged that she too was red of the hair(this had been unknown to me)       and so this homage to redheads came into being just on this wisp of information...the memories and images flood back into being."
3110,Emotion,HairPoemsBadHairDayPoembyAnaMonnar,"Bad hair day! Can you relate to this?
Is it P.M.S., hormones flaring or is it me –
If tempers are blazing, it’s best to stay away
Just give space to the person, who is upset,
Or things might be said that you will later regret
Wait for an explanation when things cool down
Maybe make up with a hug and a kiss
If you are a lady, “Can you relate to this? ”"

Deck the maiden fair
In her loveliness;
Paint the pretty face,
Dye the coral lip,
Emphasise the grace
Of her ladyship!
Art and nature, thus allied,
Go to make a pretty bride!
Sit with downcast eye,
Let it brim with dew;
Try if you can cry,
We will do so, too.
When you're summoned, start
Like a frightened roe;
Flutter, little heart,
Colour, come and go!
Modesty at marriage tide
Well becomes a pretty bride!"
3114,Emotion,HairPoemsLaChevelureHerHairPoembyCharlesBaudelaire,"Ô toison, moutonnant jusque sur l'encolure!
Ô boucles! Ô parfum chargé de nonchaloir!
Extase! Pour peupler ce soir l'alcôve obscure
Des souvenirs dormant dans cette chevelure,
Je la veux agiter dans l'air comme un mouchoir!
La langoureuse Asie et la brûlante Afrique,
Tout un monde lointain, absent, presque défunt,
Vit dans tes profondeurs, forêt aromatique!
Comme d'autres esprits voguent sur la musique,
Le mien, ô mon amour! nage sur ton parfum.
J'irai là-bas où l'arbre et l'homme, pleins de sève,
Se pâment longuement sous l'ardeur des climats;
Fortes tresses, soyez la houle qui m'enlève!
Tu contiens, mer d'ébène, un éblouissant rêve
De voiles, de rameurs, de flammes et de mâts:
Un port retentissant où mon âme peut boire
À grands flots le parfum, le son et la couleur
Où les vaisseaux, glissant dans l'or et dans la moire
Ouvrent leurs vastes bras pour embrasser la gloire
D'un ciel pur où frémit l'éternelle chaleur.
Je plongerai ma tête amoureuse d'ivresse
Dans ce noir océan où l'autre est enfermé;
Et mon esprit subtil que le roulis caresse
Saura vous retrouver, ô féconde paresse,
Infinis bercements du loisir embaumé!
Cheveux bleus, pavillon de ténèbres tendues
Vous me rendez l'azur du ciel immense et rond;
Sur les bords duvetés de vos mèches tordues
Je m'enivre ardemment des senteurs confondues
De l'huile de coco, du musc et du goudron.
Longtemps! toujours! ma main dans ta crinière lourde
Sèmera le rubis, la perle et le saphir,
Afin qu'à mon désir tu ne sois jamais sourde!
N'es-tu pas l'oasis où je rêve, et la gourde
Où je hume à longs traits le vin du souvenir?
Head of Hair
O fleecy hair, falling in curls to the shoulders!
O black locks! O perfume laden with nonchalance!
Ecstasy! To people the dark alcove tonight
With memories sleeping in that thick head of hair.
I would like to shake it in the air like a scarf!
Sweltering Africa and languorous Asia,
A whole far-away world, absent, almost defunct,
Dwells in your depths, aromatic forest!
While other spirits glide on the wings of music,
Mine, O my love! floats upon your perfume.
I shall go there, where trees and men, full of vigor,
Are plunged in a deep swoon by the heat of the land;
Heady tresses be the billows that carry me away!
Ebony sea, you hold a dazzling dream
Of rigging, of rowers, of pennons and of masts:
A clamorous harbor where my spirit can drink
In great draughts the perfume, the sound and the color;
Where the vessels gliding through the gold and the moire
Open wide their vast arms to embrace the glory
Of a clear sky shimmering with everlasting heat.
I shall bury my head enamored with rapture
In this black sea where the other is imprisoned;
And my subtle spirit caressed by the rolling
Will find you once again, O fruitful indolence,
Endless lulling of sweet-scented leisure!
Blue-black hair, pavilion hung with shadows,
You give back to me the blue of the vast round sky;
In the downy edges of your curling tresses
I ardently get drunk with the mingled odors
Of oil of coconut, of musk and tar.
A long time! Forever! my hand in your thick mane
Will scatter sapphires, rubies and pearls,
So that you will never be deaf to my desire!
Aren't you the oasis of which I dream, the gourd
From which I drink deeply, the wine of memory?
— Translated by William Aggeler
Her Hair
O fleece that down her nape rolls, plume on plume!
O curls! O scent of nonchalance and ease!
What ecstasy! To populate this room
With memories it harbours in its gloom,
I'd shake it like a banner on the breeze.
Hot Africa and languid Asia play
(An absent world, defunct, and far away)
Within that scented forest, dark and dim.
As other souls on waves of music swim,
Mine on its perfume sails, as on the spray.
I'll journey there, where man and sap-filled tree
Swoon in hot light for hours. Be you my sea,
Strong tresses! Be the breakers and gales
That waft me. Your black river holds, for me,
A dream of masts and rowers, flames and sails.
A port, resounding there, my soul delivers
With long deep draughts of perfumes, scent, and clamour,
Where ships, that glide through gold and purple rivers,
Fling wide their vast arms to embrace the glamour
Of skies wherein the heat forever quivers.
I'll plunge my head in it, half drunk with pleasure —
In this black ocean that engulfs her form.
My soul, caressed with wavelets there may measure
Infinite rocking& in embalmed leisure,
Creative idleness that fears no storm!
Blue tresses, like a shadow-stretching tent,
You shed the blue of heavens round and far.
Along its downy fringes as I went
I reeled half-drunken to confuse the scent
Of oil of coconuts, with musk and tar.
My hand forever in your mane so dense,
Rubies and pearls and sapphires there will sow,
That you to my desire be never slow —
Oasis of my dreams, and gourd from whence
Deep-draughted wines of memory will flow.
— Translated by Roy Campbell
The Fleece
O shadowy fleece that falls and curls upon those bare
Lithe shoulders! O rich perfume of forgetfulness!
O ecstasy! To loose upon the midnight air
The memories asleep in this tumultuous hair,
I long to rake it in my fingers, tress by tress!
Asia the languorous, the burning solitude
Of Africa — a whole world, distant, all but dead —
Survives in thy profundities, O odorous wood!
My soul, as other souls put forth on the deep flood
Of music, sails away upon thy scent instead.
There where the sap of life mounts hot in man and tree,
And lush desire untamed swoons in the torrid zone,
Undulant tresses, wild strong waves, oh, carry me!
Dream, like a dazzling sun, from out this ebony sea
Rises; and sails and banks of rowers propel me on.
All the confusion, all the mingled colors, cries,
Smells of a busy port, upon my senses beat;
Where smoothly on the golden streakèd ripples flies
The barque, its arms outspread to gather in the skies,
Against whose glory trembles the unabating heat.
In this black ocean where the primal ocean roars,
Drunken, in love with drunkenness, I plunge and drown;
Over my dubious spirit the rolling tide outpours
Its peace — oh, fruitful indolence, upon thy shores,
Cradled in languor, let me drift and lay me down!
Blue hair, darkness made palpable, like the big tent
Of desert sky all glittering with many a star
Thou coverest me — oh, I am drugged as with the blent
Effluvia of a sleeping caravan, the scent
Of coco oil impregnated with musk and tar.
Fear not! Upon this savage mane for ever thy lord
Will sow pearls, sapphires, rubies, every stone that gleams,
To keep thee faithful! Art not thou the sycamored
Oasis whither my thoughts journey, and the dark gourd
Whereof I drink in long slow draughts the wine of dreams?
— Translated by George Dillon
Of Her Hair
O fleece, billowing on her neck! O ecstasy!
O curls, O perfume rich with nonchalance, O rare!.
Tonight to fill the alcove's warm obscurity,
To make that hair evoke each dormant memory,
I long to wave it like a kerchief in the air.
Africa smoldering and Asia languorous,
A whole far distant world, absent and almost spent,
Dwells in your forest depths, mystic and odorous!
As others lose themselves in the harmonious,
So, love, my heart floats lost upon your haunting scent.
I shall go where both man and tree, albeit strong,
Swoon deep beneath the rays of sunlight's blazing fires.
Thick tresses, be the waves to bear my dreams along!
Ebony sea, your dazzling dream contains a throng
Of sails, of wafts, of oarsmen, and of masts like spires.
A noisy harbor where my thirsty soul may drain
Hues, sounds and fragrances, in draughts heavy and sweet,
Where vessels gliding down a moiré-and-gold sea lane
Open their vast arms wide to clutch at the domain
Of a pure sky ashimmer with eternal beat.
Deep shall I plunge my head, avid of drunkenness,
In this black sea wherein the other sea lies captured,
And my soul buoyant at its undulant caress
Shall find you once again, O fruitful idleness,
O long lullings of ease, soft, honeyed and enraptured.
O blue-black hair, pennon with sheen and shadow fraught,
You give me back the vast blue skies of dawn and dusk,
As on the downy edges of your tresses, caught
In your soft curls, I grow drunken and hot, distraught
By mingled scents of cocoanut and tar and musk.
Sapphires, rubies, pearls — my hand shall never tire
Of strewing these through your thick mane — how lavishly! —
Lest Life should ever turn you deaf to my desire!
You are the last oasis where I dream, afire,
The gourd whence deep I quaff the wine of memory.
— Translated by Jacques LeClercq
The Head of Hair
O Fleece, foaming to the neck!
O curls! O scent of laziness!
Ecstasy! This evening, to people the dark comers
Of memories that are sleeping in these locks,
I would wave them in the air like a handkerchief!
Languorous Asia and burning Africa,
A whole world, distant, absent, almost extinct,
Lives in the depths of your perfumed jungle;
As other souls sail along on music,
So mine, O my love, swims on your scent.
I shall go over there where trees and men, full of sap,
Faint away slowly in the passionate climate;
O strong locks, be the sea-swell that transports me!
You keep, O sea of ebony, a dazzling dream
Of sails and sailormen, flames and masts:
A resounding haven where in great waves
My soul can drink the scent, the sound and color;
Where ships, sliding in gold and watered silk,
Part their vast arms to embrace the glory
Of the pure sky shuddering with eternal heat
I shall plunge my head, adoring drunkenness,
Into this black ocean where the other is imprisoned;
And my subtle spirit caressed by the sway
Will know how to find you, O pregnant idleness!
In an infinite cradle of scented leisure!
Blue hair, house of taut darkness,
You make the blue of the sky seem huge and round for me;
On the downy edges of your twisted locks
I hungrily get drunk on the muddled fragrances
Of coconut oil, of musk and tar
For a long time! For ever! Amongst your heavy mane
My hand will strew the ruby, pearl and sapphire
To make you never deaf to my desire!
For are you not the oasis where I dream, the gourd
Where in great draughts I gulp the wine of memory?
— Translated by Geoffrey Wagner
O fleece, that down the neck waves to the nape!
O curls! O perfume nonchalant and rare!
O ecstasy! To fill this alcove shape
With memories that in these tresses sleep,
I would shake them like penions in the air!
Languorous Asia, burning Africa,
And a far world, defunct almost, absent,
Within your aromatic forest stay!
As other souls on music drift away,
Mine, O my love! still floats upon your scent.
I shall go there where, full of sap, both tree
And man swoon in the heat of the southern climates;
Strong tresses be the swell that carries me!
I dream upon your sea of amber
Of dazzling sails, of oarsmen, masts, and flames:
A sun-drenched and reverberating port,
Where I imbibe colour and sound and scent;
Where vessels, gliding through the gold and moiré,
Open their vast arms as they leave the shore
To clasp the pure and shimmering firmament.
I'll plunge my head, enamored of its pleasure,
In this black ocean where the other hides;
My subtle spirit then will know a measure
Of fertile idleness and fragrant leisure,
Lulled by the infinite rhythm of its tides!
Pavilion, of autumn-shadowed tresses spun,
You give me back the azure from afar;
And where the twisted locks are fringed with down
Lurk mingled odors I grow drunk upon
Of oil of coconut, of musk, and tar.
A long time! always! my hand in your hair
Will sow the stars of sapphire, pearl, ruby,
That you be never deaf to my desire,
My oasis and my gourd whence I aspire
To drink deep of the wine of memory.

3115,Emotion,HairPoemsMothersHairHasTurnedToSilverPoembyKennethRickard,"Mother's hair has turned to silver
Her skin is all wrinkled and cold
But i'd never trade my mother
For the world and all its gold.  Yes her hair has turned to silver
Her face is all covered with lines
But there'll never be another
Like this gray haired mother of mine.  I think of all the hardships
I have caused her to bare
Then I can see the reasons
For the silver in her hair.  Mother's hair has turned to silver
And her hard working days are done
But there's still a smile on her face
And a love for everyone."

3118,Emotion,HairPoemsHairAndHustlePoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"Dear can you help me for a while?
asked apologetically for a  good smile,
’No’ replied a friend, keeping distance mile,
worries all around so can’t smile,
Hounded by worries, sick for while,
how can I offer even forced smile,
pain in her voice  Keeping her mild,
mind seized with thought for her child,
She was extremely sorry,
could not afford luxury as money was worry,
situation was tense and she was in hurry,
Mind not working and hand hitting with furry,
I Will do anything for sick child,
can’t remain quite  so mild,
I will have to find some means and way,
Still have no hope and no more say,
’hair’ and ‘hustle’ is answer,
What? Hair and hustle,
what is all this about?
Fumed at answer asked, what is this all about? I asked
Explain it dear nothing going in head,
simple may be lines but can not read,
what do they and what it stand for?
Is that all meaning which they stood for?
Raged at the meaning, hair and hustle stood for,
asked again why? What really they meant?
Hair is just trimming as it is learnt,
Hustle is nothing but only business
I have no option but go for child care,
what is meaning hustle and what about hair,
they loose charm and stand nothing,
I may go for it if offered something,
Life of child is so dear
Pain may be more but I may bear,
Many stories appear and I also hear,
child should get care life I fear,
Child if suffers, I will be broke,
can’t bear any such more stroke,
So do not offer any more joke,
Even get angry if some one poke,
Hustle” I found as prostitute,
So mean word and not good substitute,
It was clever ploy on her part not tell truth,
Situation as warranted life not smooth
I remained restless and night whole awoke,
Packets after packets finished for smoke,
Hustle means selling body as she told,
I could not decide whether move was bold,
I learnt later life was living hell,
She did not find as means well,
I was not ready and also not willing,
But helpless as today soul I am killing"
3119,Emotion,HairPoemsHerHairPoembyJamesWhitcombRiley,"The beauty of her hair bewilders me-
Pouring adown the brow, its cloven tide
Swirling about the ears on either side
And storming round the neck tumultuously:
Or like the lights of old antiquity
Through mullioned windows, in cathedrals wide
Spilled moltenly o'er figures deified
In chastest marble, nude of drapery.
And so I love it- . Either unconfined;
Or plaited in close braidings manifold;
Or smoothly drawn; or indolently twined
In careless knots whose coilings come unrolled
At any lightest kiss; or by the wind
Whipped out in flossy ravellings of gold."
3120,Emotion,HairPoemsBlackIsColorOfMyTrueLovesHairPoembyJosepheBuchanan,"So many songs have been written about my love.
The beautiful color of my true love's hair. The hair of a powerful beauty.
Black as a wormhole or as simple as a crayon.
Made of ions, electrons and protons, my love must have created all things
for her hair supports everything.
From the planets, moons, suns, constellations and universes. My true love has no prejudice or hatred for any one being instead love for all she creates.
Her face lights up planets and her waters house life while her skin supports all walking creatures and four legged enigmas.
Her eyes are stars gazers while her smiles are super novas
and her beautiful black hair is simply the dark matter in space."
3121,Emotion,HairPoemsToALockOfHairPoembySirWalterScott,"Thy hue, dear pledge, is pure and bright
As in that well - remember'd night
When first thy mystic braid was wove,
And first my Agnes whisper'd love.
Since then how often hast thou prest
The torrid zone of this wild breast,
Whose wrath and hate have sworn to dwell
With the first sin that peopled hell;
A breast whose blood's a troubled ocean,
Each throb the earthquake's wild commotion!
O if such clime thou canst endure
Yet keep thy hue unstain'd and pure,
What conquest o'er each erring thought
Of that fierce realm had Agnes wrought!
I had not wander'd far and wide
With such an angel for my guide;
Nor heaven nor earth could then reprove me
If she had lived and lived to love me.
Not then this world's wild joys had been
To me one savage hunting scene,
My sole delight the headlong race
And frantic hurry of the chase;
To start, pursue, and bring to bay,
Rush in, drag down, and rend my prey,
Then - from the carcass turn away!
Mine ireful mood had sweetness tamed,
And soothed each wound which pride inflamed: -
Yes, God and man might now approve me
If thou hadst lived and lived to love me!"

Tasted the hand made in added different recipe
Replaced blindly with inappropriate chosen

the women washing their hair,
and the plaits and strands in the sun,
and the golden combs
and the combs of elephant tusks
and the combs of buffalo horn and hoof.
The sun has been good to women,
drying their heads of hair
as they stooped and shook their shoulders
and framed their faces with copper
and framed their eyes with dusk or chestnut.
The rain has been good to women.
If the rain should forget,
if the rain left off for a year—
the heads of women would wither,
the copper, the dusk and chestnuts, go.
They have painted and sung
the women washing their hair—
reckon the sun and rain in, too."

Old Scholar of the Spheres!
Thy spirit never slumbers,
But rolls about our ears
For ever and for ever.
O, what a mad endeavour
Worketh he
Who, to thy sacred and ennobled hearse,
Would offer a burnt sacrifice of verse
And Melody!
How heavenward thou soundedst
Live Temple of sweet noise;
And discord unconfoundedst:
Giving delight new joys,
And Pleasure nobler pinions--
O where are thy Dominions!
Lend thine ear
To a young delian oath--aye, by thy soul,
By all that from thy mortal Lips did roll;
And by the Kernel of thine earthly Love,
Beauty, in things on earth and things above,
When every childish fashion
Has vanish'd from my rhyme
Will I grey-gone in passion
Give to an after-time
Hymning and harmony
Of thee, and of thy Words and of thy Life:
But vain is now the bruning and the strife--
Pangs are in vain -- until I grow high-rife
With Old Philosophy
And mad with glimpses at futurity!
For many years my offerings must be hush'd:
When I do speak I'll think upon this hour,
Because I feel my forehead hot and flush'd,
Even at the simplest vassal of thy Power,--
A Lock of thy bright hair!
Sudden it came,
And I was startled when I heard thy name
Coupled so unaware--
Yet, at the moment, temperate was my blood:
Methought I had beheld it from the flood."
3125,Emotion,HairPoemsMyMothersHairPoembyOvwighoJosephOvedje,"One of your hairs fell out last night:
A piece of your life was gone without a sound.
I know a difficult day is coming,
My heart, pierced, utters a quiet cry.
Let my childhood smile again in the sun
And turn me into an innocent little head louse
So I can crawl through the jungle of your hair
And sing a song of darkness in its fragrance.
Under your fingernail-roof Ill sleep in my house;
In my black dream Ill water your black trees.
Ill pick black fruits, and hair-jungle bees
Will bring me black poems to be opened.
How will I live, without your hair?
How will I breathe, without its fragrance?
How will I survive, when I am discovered
By ghosts of wooden combs combing your hair?
Let me wear shows made of dawn-flowers
And crawl without a sound into your sleep.
Ill take the place of the hair that's gone
And sing of hair-clouds flying from night to day."
3126,Emotion,HairPoemsToHerHairPoembyLordEdwardHerbertofCherbury,"Black beamy hairs, which so seem to arise
From the extraction of those eyes,
That into you she destin-like doth spin
The beams she spares, what time her soul retires,
And by those hallowed fires,
Keeps house all night within.
Since from within her awful front you shine,
As threads of life which she doth twine,
And thence ascending with your fatal rays,
Do crown those temples, where Love's wonders wrought
We afterwards see brought
To vulgar light and praise.
Lighten through all your regions, till we find
The causes why we are grown blind,
That when we should your glories comprehend
Our sight recoils, and turneth back again,
And doth, as 'twere in vain,
Itself to you extend.
Is it because past black there is not found
A fixed or horizontal bound?
And so, as it doth terminate the white,
It may be said all colors to infold,
And in that kind to hold
Somewhat of infinite?
Or is it that the center of our sight
Being veiled in its proper night
Discerns your blackness by some other sense
Than that by which it doth pied colors see,

So diapred from that black eye.

That shining light in darkness all would find,

3128,Emotion,HairPoemsImeldaMarcosDoesntCompareToThisRedHairVixenPoembyJoeRosochacki,"Did I see a red hair vixen at several DSW’s?
A ‘canine’ with a fetish of shoes?
It can’t be.
Anyway it has; a wily fox outsmarted the bi-pedals taking their shoes.
I know that this fox has a German background,
She wasn’t a ‘desert fox’ I later found,
Was she related to General Rommel?
Anyway, to make a long story even longer,
This vixen cunningly stole pairs of shoes from people,
She could have stole them for toys,
-for her kits, or wear them in style.
Slippers, boots, and sneakers;
-she had taken them from various porches for awhile.
She tried and tried and tried,
To get the right shoes to fit.
The case was cracked when a forestry worker stumbled upon an astonishing scene in the woods:
-dozens of shoes lay strewn on the forest floor surrounding a fox's den.
Even more were discovered inside!
By the way,
'We found 86 shoes in the den and a further 32 in a nearby quarry,
-where they like to play.'
What were the clues?
Tiny little teeth marks on the shoelaces leads the Count to theorize that the vixen had
been stealing the footwear for her cubs to play with. That, or she 'simply likes
collecting shoes, ' say the locals.
And, really, who could fault a female for liking shoes?
Imelda Marcos had 2400 pairs in her ‘den’.
As far as the vixen correcting her ways.
Not a chance,
'More shoes have gone missing in the last few days.'

3130,Emotion,HairPoemsWrinklesAndGreyHairChildrenPoembyCJHeck,"Mommy's getting wrinkles.
Daddy has grey hair.
It wasn't very long ago
when those things weren't there.
Wish I could smooth the wrinkles out
and darken Daddy's hair
to stop the changes going on.
It makes me feel so scared.
Grampa, does it mean they'll die?
They have wrinkles and grey hair!
I never used to worry
before those things were there.
Grampa said to look at him.
There were lots of wrinkles there,
and on his head, a snowstorm
was the color of his hair.
'Wrinkles only come to point
where smiles were, here and there.
It's your mommy's turn to get some
for the happy times you've shared.'
His white, and Daddy's grey hair
well, it was there to show
who had lived the longest time
so everyone could know!
Grampa said it's part of life.
We love, we learn, we live.
We earn grey hair and wrinkles,
they're prizes only God can give."

3134,Emotion,HairPoemsHairRaisingPoembyMichaelShepherd,"The fun thing about being dead
is the haunting. Revenge. It's Payback Time Whoo Hoo.
I'm updating my Visiting Book,
adding some, crossing off a few
in case my memory's not immortal.
It's quite a long list, though I try to be
as fair as one can inhumanly be:
I've always been the target of con-men
of all ages and oh yes con-dames too.
It took me a while to get wise:
they all think they're smarter than they are...
though by then it's usually too late.
Moving on to those who've bullied me;
who assumed (and alas, oh so did I)
that I was cut out to be a victim;
and all those who I let push me around
for their own promotion, empire, glory, satisfaction...
well now I don't want to bore you but
you get my drift. However, perhaps you didn't know
that the old-fashioned loose white robe
or ectoplasm, cold air, that stuff - out;
like pandemics and computer viruses,
we keep up with the times - it's easy
when there's no time to keep up with.
Photography was a giant step
for ghostkind; when it was still blacknwhite
we were those outafocus blurs that walked
along where the wall wasn 't any more,
through the doors that were not there,
in the life you did not lead,
a bit like Eliot's garden...
but when colour came into your holiday snaps -
there you are, Caribbean-hormoned,
honeymooning with your third young wife,
Viagra-ed, Cialis-ed, sunkissed, gin-blissed,
and hello! we never snapped that family group...with
those two blurry familiar faces in the background...
out in Concorde, back in discord...
Then came computers...you really do make
our task more fun for us; we're the cyber-virus
or ghost in the machine that affects, ha, only yours; and who
picked up your digi-cam that night and photographed your dreams?
or slipped that sexy message under the office address?
the bit I haven't yet worked out
in all this (well-deserved)  fun
is that most of the worst offenders in my visiting-book have -
you know - passed on - and
will be there to (greet?)  me. That thought rather
haunts me."

Silent and starving, I prowl through the streets.
Bread does not nourish me, dawn disrupts me, all day
I hunt for the liquid measure of your steps.
I hunger for your sleek laugh,

hunger for the pale stones of your fingernails,
I want to eat your skin like a whole almond.
I want to eat the sunbeam flaring in your lovely body,
the sovereign nose of your arrogant face,
I want to eat the fleeting shade of your lashes,
and I pace around hungry, sniffing the twilight,
hunting for you, for your hot heart,
like a puma in the barrens of Quitratue.

3137,Emotion,HairPoemsAWomansDirtyHairPoembyUriahHamilton,"An old car
Moves slowly
Through cold rain;
A modern city
Grows ancient
In the sad fog
Of urban despair.
A woman’s dirty hair
Is pulled
By an oily hand
In a rat-infested

God ignores suffering
But also kindly turns his head
To the indiscriminate sex
That helps the hopeless
Alleviate poverty-born
Unrelenting stress."

3139,Emotion,HairPoemsBoyWithHisHairCutShortPoembyMurielRukeyser,"SUNDAY shuts down on this twentieth-century evening.
The L passes. Twilight and bulb define
the brown room, the overstuffed plum sofa,
the boy, and the girl's thin hands above his head.
A neighbor radio sings stocks, news, serenade.
He sits at the table, head down, the young clear neck exposed,
watching the drugstore sign from the tail of his eye;
tattoo, neon, until the eye blears, while his
solicitous tall sister, simple in blue, bending
behind him, cuts his hair with her cheap shears.
The arrow's electric red always reaches its mark,
successful neon! He coughs, impressed by that precision.
His child's forehead, forever protected by his cap,
is bleached against the lamplight as he turns head
and steadies to let the snippets drop.
Erasing the failure of weeks with level fingers,
she sleeks the fine hair, combing: 'You'll look fine tomorrow!
You'll surely find something, they can't keep turning you down;
the finest gentleman's not so trim as you!' Smiling, he raises
the adolescent forehead wrinkling ironic now.
He sees his decent suit laid out, new-pressed,
his carfare on the shelf. He lets his head fall, meeting
her earnest hopeless look, seeing the sharp blades splitting,
the darkened room, the impersonal sign, her motion,
the blue vein, bright on her temple, pitifully beating."

you are made of bread, a bread the fire adores.
The grain grew high in its harvest of you,
in good time the flour swelled;
as the dough rose, doubling your breasts,
my love was the coal waiting ready in the earth.
Oh, bread your forehead, your legs, your mouth,
bread I devour, born with the morning light,
my love, beacon-flag of the bakeries:
fire taugh you a lesson of the blood;
you learned your holiness from flour,
from bread your language and aroma."
3141,Emotion,HairPoemsHairTodayGoneTomorrowPoembyJohnCarterBrown,"I shudder to think
What life would be like
If women, like men, started thinning;
No peace would be found,
Men would go underground;
There'd be wailing and grief,
There'd be grinding of teeth,
And that would be just the beginning!
Hair-driers and dyes
Would be laid to one side,
As experts were given the time
To find a solution,
To make restitution
By each and all means,
To repairing the genes
Accused of this dastardly crime.
Yes, I shudder to think,
As all women, as one,
Bring all of their powers to bear;
To crush to submission
Illegal permission;
To mess with their beauty,
To ignore their duty
The genes have for growing their hair.
And if the malefactors
Are thinking they'll win
This battle in which they are caught,
They know not their fate,
They've no case to state,
No lesson was learnt,
Even try it, they daren't...
By the way - it was only a thought!

3142,Emotion,HairPoemsEllaWithTheShiningHairPoembyHenryKendall,"Through many a fragrant cedar grove
A darkened water moans;
And there pale Memory stood with Love
Amongst the moss-green stones.
The shimmering sunlight fell and kissed
The grasstree’s golden sheaves;
But we were troubled with a mist
Of music in the leaves.
One passed us, like a sudden gleam;
Her face was deadly fair.
“Oh, go,” we said, “you homeless Dream
Of Ella’s shining hair!
“We halt, like one with tired wings,
And we would fain forget
That there are tempting, maddening things
Too high to clutch at yet!
“Though seven Springs have filled the Wood
With pleasant hints and signs,
Since faltering feet went forth and stood
With Death amongst the pines.”
From point to point unwittingly
We wish to clamber still,
Till we have light enough to see
The summits of the hill.
“O do not cry, my sister dear,”
Said beaming Hope to Love,
“Though we have been so troubled here
The Land is calm above;
“Beyond the regions of the storm
We’ll find the golden gates,
Where, all the day, a radiant Form,
Our Ella, sits and waits.”
And Memory murmured: “She was one
Of God’s own darlings lent;
And Angels wept that she had gone,
And wondered why she went.
“I know they came, and talked to her,
Through every garden breeze,
About eternal Hills of Myrrh,
And quiet Jasper Seas.
“For her the Earth contained no charms;
All things were strange and wild;
And I believe a Seraph’s arms
Caught up the sainted Child.”
And Love looked round, and said: “Oh, you
That sit by Beulah’s streams,
Shake on this thirsty life the dew
Which brings immortal dreams!
“Ah! turn to us, and greet us oft
With looks of pitying balm,
And hints of heaven, in whispers soft,
To make our troubles calm.
“My Ella with the shining hair,
Behold, these many years,
We’ve held up wearied hands in prayer;
And groped about in tears.”
But Hope sings on: “Beyond the storm
We’ll find the golden gates
Where, all the day, a radiant Form,
Our Ella, sits and waits.”"
3143,Emotion,HairPoemsWhenMotherCombedMyHairPoembyJamesWhitcombRiley,"When Memory, with gentle hand,
Has led me to that foreign land
Of childhood days, I long to be
Again the boy on bended knee,
With head a-bow, and drowsy smile
Hid in a mother's lap the while,
With tender touch and kindly care,
She bends above and combs my hair.
Ere threats of Time, or ghosts of cares
Had paled it to the hue it wears,
Its tangled threads of amber light
Fell o'er a forehead, fair and white,
That only knew the light caress
Of loving hands, or sudden press
Of kisses that were sifted there
The times when mother combed my hair.
But its last gleams of gold have slipped
Away; and Sorrow's manuscript
Is fashioned of the snowy brow--
So lined and underscored now
That you, to see it, scarce would guess
It e'er had felt the fond caress
Of loving lips, or known the care
Of those dear hands that combed my hair.
. . . . . . . .
I am so tired! Let me be
A moment at my mother's knee;
One moment--that I may forget
The trials waiting for me yet:
One moment free from every pain--
O! Mother! Comb my hair again!
And I will, oh, so humbly bow,
For I've a wife that combs it now."

But, This ones different,
Its about a girl, Whos hair was gold,
She had a smile like no other,
Everyone thought she was happy,
But little did they know,
Her smile was fake,
She just wanted to leave, to go,
Be free from the pain shes in,
Her brother, 'He', 'Him',
Emotionly bruised her soul,
She wont let anyone touch her,
Fearing that she will lose control,
Her Father, 'Just another'
So mixed up in alchol and drugs,
He cant even tell how hurt she is,
Her eyes flood with red blood tears,
Her Mother, 'There, But not'
She knows, but doesnt help,
Trying to support a family on her own,
Too much stress, Not enough fears,
And the girl with golden hair,
And a smile like no other?
Well, She struggling to keep it all together,
Crying herself to sleep everynight,
Having to deal with her Brother, Father and Mother,
So do you think the girl with the Golden hair,
And  a smile like no other is really happy?
Well shes not, because her life is rather crappy."
3145,Emotion,HairPoemsILoveMyHairPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"I love my hair
I always toss it around in the air
As if without a care!
I love my hair
Once I caught the super hair bug
Caught it whilst I slept on an old rug
The super lice were playing scratch, scratch, and scratch
While my fingernails were playing catch, catch and catch
Finally my hair was shaven as there was no cure, no other drug
I wore my head on my shoulder for a while with a distasteful shrug
Hiding underneath a cap with obvious bald patches that seemed to match
I love my hair
Long, golden plaited and brown
Enough to move heads around in town
People just want to come near
And stare! Stare at me! Who is that alien from elsewhere?
My hair is beautifully plaited in strands
This kind of hair fashion is high in demand
So many different styles to experiment with and expand
Today a woman needs to look good, do you understand?
I talk to my hair with oils
I say today I need you to curl
And when I style you,
Stay in place, do not spoil!
I wash my hair twice a day
Maybe when I am old, it would go grey
But for now the beauty is here to stay
I hope so, I definitely pray!
Beware all, take care
I love my hair, I love my hair
Don’t touch! But you can stare
You can stare at how I wear
My beautiful hair!
Try and out-do me if you dare!
I love my hair
I like to show it off
Around me do not sneeze or cough
Or with you I can be horribly tough
Around me do not sneeze or cough
If you don’t want to know the meaning of rough
I mean it, this isn’t a bluff!
I love my hair!

4     Happy as the daisies that dance on her way.

6     Many were the blithe birds that warbled them o'er:
7     Oh! I dream of Jeanie with the light brown hair,
8     Floating, like a vapor, on the soft summer air.
9     I long for Jeanie with the daydawn smile,
10   Radiant in gladness, warm with winning guile;
11   I hear her melodies, like joys gone by,
12   Sighing round my heart o'er the fond hopes that die: --
13   Sighing like the night wind and sobbing like the rain, --
14   Wailing for the lost one that comes not again:
15   Oh! I long for Jeanie, and my heart bows low,
16   Never more to find her where the bright waters flow.
17   I sigh for Jeanie, but her light form strayed
18   Far from the fond hearts round her native glade;
19   Her smiles have vanished and her sweet songs flown,
20   Flitting like the dreams that have cheered us and gone.
21   Now the nodding wild flowers may wither on the shore
22   While her gentle fingers will cull them no more:

My breeze it unties the air
I have blue whispered vison's
And some very long silver hair
I dance down romance lane
That the Roses paved today
Glistening aromatic petals
Of a velvet-toned petal inlay
Whispers of private promises
Softly move throughout this space
Encounters of Origami lovers
Come at last face to face
While in the background
Playing a mystical mandolin
Pulsing out the melodies
Of where true love begins
Moving on over the ages
Together forever oh so rare
But not impossible at all
When it comes to being

3148,Emotion,HairPoemsBigHairPoembyDavidLehman,"Ithaca, October 1993: Jorie went on a lingerie
tear, wanting to look like a moll
in a Chandler novel. Dinner, consisting of three parts gin
and one part lime juice cordial, was a prelude to her hair.
There are, she said, poems that can be written
only when the poet is clad in black underwear.
But that's Jorie for you. Always cracking wise, always where
the action is, the lights, and the sexy lingerie.
Poems, she said, were meant to be written
on the run, like ladders on the stockings of a gun moll
at a bar. Jorie had to introduce the other poet with the fabulous hair
that night. She'd have preferred to work out at the gym.
She'd have preferred to work out with Jim.
She'd have preferred to be anywhere
but here, where young men gawked at her hair
and old men swooned at the thought of her lingerie.
""If you've seen one, you've seen the moll,""
Jorie said when asked about C. ""Everything she's written
is an imitation of E."" Some poems can be written
only when the poet has fortified herself with gin.
Others come easily to one as feckless as Moll
Flanders. Jorie beamed. ""It happened here,""
she said. She had worn her best lingerie,
and D. made the expected pass at her. ""My hair
was big that night, not that I make a fetish of hair,
but some poems must not be written
by bald sopranos."" That night she lectured on lingerie
to an enthusiastic audience of female gymnasts and gin-
drinking males. ""Utopia,"" she said, ""is nowhere.""
This prompted one critic to declare that, of them all,
all the poets with hair, Jorie was the fairest moll.
The New York Times voted her ""best hair.""
Iowa City was said to be the place where
all aspiring poets went, their poems written
on water, with blanks instead of words, a tonic
of silence in the heart of noise, and a vision of lingerie
in the bright morning -- the lingerie to be worn by a moll
holding a tumbler of gin, with her hair
wet from the shower and her best poems waiting to be written."

Hovering round thee, let it fly!
Let it fly as unconfined
As its calm ravisher the wind,

To wanton o'er that spicy nest.
Every tress must be confest,
But neatly tangled at the best;

Most excellently ravelled.

3151,Emotion,HairPoemsArtIsLongHairIsShorterPoembyClarenceMichaelJamesStanislausDennis,"When artists wore a flowing mane,
Then, in a sentimental vein,
With pastorals they lured the eye,
Or sad, sweet scenes of sea and sky.
But now that hair sprouts from the face
They chuck their paint about the place
And, in the modern manner, seek
To baffle one with the unique.
I've often wondered if this surge
Of hirsute foam denotes some urge
Artistic that controls and sways
The hand and brain to newer ways.
For instance, might we not expect
An artist in dundrearies decked
In other manner to behave
From him who wore a monkey shave?
I've known but one of this quaint throng
Who wore both hair and whiskers long,
But he, poor bloke, was short of cash,
And wore a full beard and moustache
That he might draw on this supply
When price of brushes soared to high ...
But there are ways, it seems to me.
To test my novel theory.
If some brave man would range the land
And catch a few of this quaint band
And hold them captive for a while
Who knows what tricks of school and style
One might evolve if, to each man,
We gave a different hirsute plan?
You doubt, perhaps?  But all the same,
There might be money in the game."

you wiped a lost tear
out of your eye
when the jet
made the skyline of Los Angeles
fade away in the distance
and giant buildings
disappeared into naught.
So I wondered if you know
how a green country
with plains
and open spaces of the Karoo looks
and have you looked
at wild game grazing,
or will nature
be strange to you?
I couldn’t wait
to be back in my own country
and your opinions about apartheid,
knowing something
but without comprehension,
for a while
pinched me sore
and it was evident
that you didn’t really understand
and also that my country
are slowly but surely
falling to pieces.
I told you something
about my people,
about a country
where the sun always shine
and that I also
just want a place there
and the break
with your boyfriend in Iraq
had split your heart
in two
and we talked for a long time
and suddenly you comprehended
that Afrikaners are just like
any other people
and you were already half in love
when we had to part,
but it was apparent
that we are living
in two different worlds."

When air rushes through them
I want that moment to be stopped
Such a beauty your hair has given
They add colours to all your elements

Love life, love your hair."
3158,Emotion,HairPoemsDreamingOfHairPoembyLiYoungLee,"Ivy ties the cellar door
in autumn, in summer morning glory
wraps the ribs of a mouse.
Love binds me to the one
whose hair I've found in my mouth,
whose sleeping head I kiss,
wondering is it death?
beauty? this dark
star spreading in every direction from the crown of her head.
My love's hair is autumn hair, there
the sun ripens.
My fingers harvest the dark
vegtable of her body.
In the morning I remove it
from my tongue and
sleep again.
Hair spills
through my dream, sprouts
from my stomach, thickens my heart,
and tangles from the brain. Hair ties the tongue dumb.
Hair ascends the tree
of my childhood--the willow
I climbed
one bare foot and hand at a time,
feeling the knuckles of the gnarled tree, hearing
my father plead from his window, _Don't fall!_
In my dream I fly
past summers and moths,
to the thistle
caught in my mother's hair, the purple one
I touched and bled for,
to myself at three, sleeping
beside her, waking with her hair in my mouth.
Along a slippery twine of her black hair
my mother ties ko-tze knots for me:
fish and lion heads, chrysanthemum buds, the heads
of Chinamen, black-haired and frowning.
Li-En, my brother, frowns when he sleeps.
I push back his hair, stroke his brow.
His hairline is our father's, three peaks pointing down.
What sprouts from the body
and touches the body?
What filters sunlight
and drinks moonlight?
Where have I misplaced my heart?
What stops wheels and great machines?
What tangles in the bough
and snaps the loom?
Out of the grave
my father's hair
bursts. A strand
pierces my left sole, shoots
up bone, past ribs,
to the broken heart it stiches,
then down,
swirling in the stomach, in the groin, and down,
through the right foot.
What binds me to this earth?
What remembers the dead
and grows towards them?
I'm tired of thinking.
I long to taste the world with a kiss.
I long to fly into hair with kisses and weeping,
remembering an afternoon
when, kissing my sleeping father, I saw for the first time
behind the thick swirl of his black hair,
the mole of wisdom,
a lone planet spinning slowly.
Sometimes my love is melancholy
and I hold her head in my hands.
Sometimes I recall our hair grows after death.
Then, I must grab handfuls
of her hair, and, I tell you, there
are apples, walnuts, ships sailing, ships docking, and men
taking off their boots, their hearts breaking,
not knowing
which they love more, the water, or
their women's hair, sprouting from the head, rushing toward the feet."

Tangled in a thousand strands.

Tangled my tangled memories
Of our long nights of love making."

3161,Emotion,HairPoemsApologyToDeliaForDesiringALockOfHerHairPoembyWilliamCowper,"Delia, the unkindest girl on earth,
When I besought the fair,
That favour of intrinsic worth
A ringlet of her hair,
Refused that instant to comply
With my absurd request,
For reasons she could specify,
Some twenty score at least.
Trust me, my dear, however odd
It may appear to say,
I sought it merely to defraud
Thy spoiler of his prey.
Yes! when its sister locks shall fade,
As quickly fade they must,
When all their beauties are decayed,
Their gloss, their colour, lost—
Ah then! if haply to my share
Some slender pittance fall,
If I but gain one single hair,
Nor age usurp them all;—
When you behold it still as sleek,
As lovely to the view,
As when it left thy snowy neck,
That Eden where it grew,
Then shall my Delia's self declare
That I professed the truth,
And have preserved my little share
In everlasting youth."
3162,Emotion,HairPoemsHairTodayGoneTomorrowPoembyJoeRosochacki,"The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance will issue a guideline for haircuts on men.
Teheran has been busy this week first condemning a woman to death,
-by stoning, for being an alleged adulterer.
Teheran's judicial vision, being blinded as a woman behind a Burka,
--no tolerance to the shamelessly unforgiven.
It's westernized hairstyles that leads to spiritual upheaval.
'Ponytails, spikes, mullets and Mohawks are now forbidden,
but Elvis-style locks, floppy fringes and Simon Cowell-esque flattops
(don't look now for Iranian Idol is approaching)
get the ayatollahs' seal of approval.'
This reminds me of Hitler,
That little moustache, the inverted Buddhist symbol for happiness,
The goose-stepping, saluting with their arms outstretched servants of The Third Reich
This reminds me of the psychotic leader of the USSR Joseph Stalin,
And all his 'no-goodniks' dressed in similar Army uniforms
and wearing his hair style that he wore and their moustaches that were his clone
This reminds of Castro look-a-likes Cuba a few decades ago,
Same camouflage clothing; same mustache
This reminds of the Mao-Tse-Tung and the revolutionary guard
Same blue-gray suit, same shoes,
(no moustaches; have ever seen a moustache on a Asian man?)
This reminds of Saddam Hussain photo array,
His supporters had the same haircut, same mustache
Kim Jong-il and his goons dressed all alike even until today
What is common element?
They were/are all dictators; they were all self-percieved gods
-or happened to be, acting on God's wish.
Hitler was acting on God's will accordingly to Evangelical Minister the Rev. Hagee,
I wonder that Hagee believes God, unlike the Devil, would steal, destroy and kill Jews;
It seems to be an apparent paradox upon his belief system that should perish.
Anyway back to haircuts done Iranian style.
If a country has sink to low of the barbaric stoning to death of 'alleged' adulterer,
If a country has to silence the political opposition by either marshal or Koranic law,
It's all the same to me, Iran you are no different than any other dictatorship,
Do you really think that God/Allah really cares on what type of haircuts men wear?
The ayatollahs' words are not the words of God/Allah, no more than Pope's words,
Nor that of the Queen of England words.
The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance need guidance,
-and Iran needs hope,
-for individual justice and freedom under any circumstance.

3165,Emotion,HairPoemsAStrandOfHairPoembyDavidHarris,"Hills and mountains are dotted
across our landscape fair,
at the top of either
you are at the roof of the world
looking down upon
all who live below.
You stand and gaze at the world
an all the riches it bestows.
Seeing everyone’s destiny
in a strand of hair.
Loves maybe invisible to the naked eye,
but you have to be blind
not to see it in someone else’s eyes.
Strangers pass on a street
neither ever seen the other before.
There is an attraction
that makes them stop and look around;
soon they are together
melting into one another’s arms.
Love is just a chance meeting
between strangers somewhere.
No one can prepare for it.
How can you prepare for something
you never know when it will happen?
The only thing you can do
is carry on doing what you have to do
and let cupid’s arrow fly
when and if it must.
You maybe smitten
if his aim is true,
in the meantime don’t lie
awake at night wishing for
what tomorrow might never bring.
Just go out and live a life
as normal as can be.
For love and cupid will seize
a chance when you are unaware.

Stirs its thin outer threads, as though beside
The living head I stood in honoured pride,
Talking of lovely things that conquer death.
Perhaps he pressed it once, or underneath
Ran his fine fingers when he leant, blank-eyed,
And saw in fancy Adam and his bride
With their heaped locks, or his own Delphic wreath.
There seems a love in hair, though it be dead.
It is the gentlest, yet the strongest thread
Of our frail plant,--a blossom from the tree
Surviving the proud trunk; as if it said,
Patience and gentleness in power. In me
Behold affectionate eternity."

My veins have been cut and my bruises made
But at your feet I fall and down goes my cascade
I promise to you that I will get better
But believe me when I say it's only getting harder

It hurts so much I suffocate in the tears I told you I'm not crying

for i am new here and i have a big tummy

inside my pockets, she knows that soon

3175,Emotion,HairPoemsAChildsHairPoembyWilliamWatson,"A letter from abroad. I tear
Its sheathing open, unaware
What treasure gleams within; and there-
Like bird from cage-
Flutters a curl of golden hair
Out of the page.
From such a frolic head 'twas shorn!
('Tis but five years since he was born.)
Not sunlight scampering over corn
Were merrier thing.
A child? A fragment of the morn,
A piece of Spring!
Surely an ampler, fuller day
Than drapes our English skies with grey-
A deeper light, a richer ray
Than here we know-
To this bright tress have given away
Their living glow.
For Willie dwells where gentian flowers
Make mimic sky in mountain bowers;
And vineyards steeped in ardent hours
Slope to the wave
Where storied Chillon's tragic towers
Their bases lave;
And over piny tracts of Vaud
The rose of eve steals up the snow;
And on the waters far below
Strange sails like wings
Half-bodilessly come and go,
Fantastic things;
And tender night falls like a sigh
On
châlet
low and
château
high;
And the far cataract's voice comes nigh,
Where no man hears;
And spectral peaks impale the sky
On silver spears.
Ah, Willie, whose dissevered tress
Lies in my hand!-may you possess
At least one sovereign happiness,
Ev'n to your grave;
One boon than which I ask naught less,
Naught greater crave:
May cloud and mountain, lake and vale,
Never to you be trite or stale
As unto souls whose wellsprings fail
Or flow defiled,
Till Nature's happiest fairy-tale
Charms not her child!
For when the spirit waxes numb,
Alien and strange these shows become,
And stricken with life's tedium
The streams run dry,
The choric spheres themselves are dumb,
And dead the sky,-
Dead as to captives grown supine,
Chained to their task in sightless mine:
Above, the bland day smiles benign,
Birds carol free,
In thunderous throes of life divine
Leaps the glad sea;
But they-their day and night are one.
What is't to them, that rivulets run,
Or what concern of theirs the sun?
It seems as though
Their business with these things was done
Ages ago:
Only, at times, each dulled heart feels
That somewhere, sealed with hopeless seals,
The unmeaning heaven about him reels,
And he lies hurled
Beyond the roar of all the wheels
Of all the world.
*
On what strange track one's fancies fare!
To eyeless night in sunless lair
'Tis a far cry from Willie's hair;
And here it lies-
Human, yet something which can ne'er
Grow sad and wise:
Which, when the head where late it lay
In life's grey dusk itself is grey,
And when the curfew of life's day
By death is tolled,
Shall forfeit not the auroral ray
And eastern gold."
3176,Emotion,HairPoemsBadHairDaysAFunPoemPoembyMeggieGultiano,"Everyday is always a bad hair day for me
Mine is very curly, they told me it's kinky
I have a hard time combing my hair, you see
Have to visit my hairdresser to fix it for me
It was very shiny, as straight as can be
It was always like these since I was a little lady
Now, I am used to see this everyday
Ummm, I don't see what happened to me
Getting up early in the morning is not that easy
I have to have a ribbon to hold it, the neighbors might see
Never mind If they laugh at me and call me crazy
I have a God who loves me and take care of me.
Hey! I am elated this way, God created me like that,
And no bad hair day will ever make me give it back,
Yes! Truly blessed to have hair as pleasing as can be,
Think what you want, I absolutely adore it. He he he!
Hmmm..not a bad hair day at all...I love it..! ! ! He he he"
3177,Emotion,HairPoemsSonnetXviiiINeverGaveALockOfHairPoembyElizabethBarrettBrowning,"I never gave a lock of hair away
To a man, dearest, except this to thee,
Which now upon my fingers thoughtfully,
I ring out to the full brown length and say
Take it.
My day of youth went yesterday;
My hair no longer bounds to my foot's glee,
Nor plant I it from rose or myrtle-tree,
As girls do, any more: it only may
Now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears,
Taught drooping from the head that hangs aside
Through sorrow's trick. I thought the funeral-shears
Would take this first, but Love is justified,--
Take it thou,--finding pure, from all those years,
The kiss my mother left here when she died."

Listen to pretty lies
And love to hear them told;
Doubt not that Solomon
Listen’d to many a one,—
Some in his youth, and more when he grew old.
I never was among
The choir of Wisdom’s song,
But pretty lies lov’d I
As much as any king,
When youth was on the wing,
And (must it then be told?) when youth had quite gone by.
Alas! and I have not
The pleasant hour forgot
When one pert lady said,
“O Walter! I am quite
Bewilder’d with affright!
I see (sit quiet now) a white hair on your head!”
Another more benign
Snipp’d it away from mine,
And in her own dark hair
Pretended it was found…

will grandma Mickey’s hair still be white,  when we are in heaven?
why do six year olds think about life and death?
why do they not seem afraid
and see it as a natural part of living life
we fear death,
we avoid hospitals, when friends are ill
and when we do go there it is quick to help speed the recovery
of the ill and get out as quick as you can
when people are ill we don’t see them as much,
they understand no one wants to be around seriously ill people
and don’t invite themselves to events they know
will cause others grief
will grandma Mickey’s hair still be white, when we are in heaven?
shows an understanding that she will be in a form that we will recognize
and still be our grandmother
and white signifies pureness, in every circumstance
except as related to hair
will grandma Mickey’s hair still be white, when we are in heaven?
is a question best answered by saying
what color would you want her hair to be

whatever color she would want"

So I'm white

Really only two races exist:
the decent and the indecent.
Skin pigmentation
has nothing to do with it.
And
We all bleed red.
The last time I checked
we all put on our pants one leg at a time.
We laugh, we cry, we live, we die!
We could mix beautifully and have lovely children
with chocolate skin or deep deep shades of black and brown
or pale whites and lovely yellows with green eyes.
I would much rather kiss you on the lips
and celebrate life and the potential
for a wider gene pool than fight any day.
God either laughs or cries about enabling us
to see the various shades and colors of existence.
In my world Jesus is black with blue eyes and blond hair."

O curls! O perfume nonchalant and rare!
O ecstasy! To fill this alcove shape
With memories that in these tresses sleep,
I would shake them like penions in the air!
Languorous Asia, burning Africa,
And a far world, defunct almost, absent,
Within your aromatic forest stay!
As other souls on music drift away,
Mine, O my love! still floats upon your scent.
I shall go there where, full of sap, both tree
And man swoon in the heat of the southern climates;
Strong tresses be the swell that carries me!
I dream upon your sea of amber
Of dazzling sails, of oarsmen, masts, and flames:
A sun-drenched and reverberating port,
Where I imbibe colour and sound and scent;
Where vessels, gliding through the gold and moiré,
Open their vast arms as they leave the shore
To clasp the pure and shimmering firmament.
I'll plunge my head, enamored of its pleasure,
In this black ocean where the other hides;
My subtle spirit then will know a measure
Of fertile idleness and fragrant leisure,
Lulled by the infinite rhythm of its tides!
Pavilion, of autumn-shadowed tresses spun,
You give me back the azure from afar;
And where the twisted locks are fringed with down
Lurk mingled odors I grow drunk upon
Of oil of coconut, of musk, and tar.
A long time! always! my hand in your hair
Will sow the stars of sapphire, pearl, ruby,
That you be never deaf to my desire,
My oasis and my gourd whence I aspire
To drink deep of the wine of memory."

any answers.
Still, we imply.
All that I have come

the measurement of time,
the presence of light,

Across the lake
there is a girl
running her fingers
through her waist length hair.

It's intriguing.  I am intrigued by her.
By the slow split she makes
in that curtain of hair.
By the moonlight and it's cravings.

3188,Emotion,HairPoemsHairPoembyGlenRuff,"I don't care for hair
If I was bare of hair, I wouldn't care
For if the weather isn't fair
I have hats and coats to wear
I see no need for this body fuzz
Oh, long ago, there maybe was
Before we knew what clothing does
Some say hair's their ""crowning glory""
I don't buy that silly story
They wash and brush and curl and comb it
And some, with beer, they even foam it
They get it cut, they get it styled
Or maybe tease it up all wild
They bleach and braid and dye the stuff
They make it soft, they make it rough
I think that hair is just a pain
It gets in your food, it'll plug your drain
It hangs all down when it gets wet
With rain or snow or even sweat
As far as I can see
From this stuff we should be free
But, you might not agree
Most folks don't think the same as me
But, if you think that hair is fine
Then I wish that I could give you mine
For I'm not bare of hair
I have my share that I must wear
But if it should go, I wouldn't care
'Cause I don't care for hair"
3189,Emotion,MemoryPoemsAnOdeInBlessedMemoryPoembyMikhailVasilyevichLomonosov,"1
A sudden bliss has seized my mind,
And to a mountain peak it carries me
Up where the wind's forgotten how to stir the trees;
The deepest valley lies in silence.
Perceiving something, quiet goes the brook
That used to babble without cease
When rushing swiftly down the hill.
There, they are braiding laurel wreaths
And word is spread to every side;
Smoke curls up from the fields afar.
2
Do I see Pindus down below me?
I hear the pristine sisters' songs!
With flame Permessian I burn,
I strive in haste toward their visage.
They've given me the healing water:
Drink, and forget your every toil;
Rinse out your eyes with dew Castalian.
Beyond steppes and mountains cast your gaze,
Direct your soul toward those lands
Where morning breaks upon dark night.

Just like a ship 'midst raving waves
That threaten to engulf it,
Severs their frothing caps,
And clings steadfastly to its course
Amidst the raging silver foam,
Its wake ablaze across the deep:
Thus did the hordes of Tatars haste
Around to meet the Russian force;
Cavalry steam obscures the sky!
What happens then? They're felled at once.
4
Love for the Fatherland empowers
The souls and hands of Russian sons;
They each desire to spill their blood,
They draw their strength from sounds of war.
How does the mighty lion scare
A wolf pack baring poison teeth
Showing ferocious, gleaming eyes?
His roaring quakes the woods and shore,
His tail churns up the dust and sand,
Uncoiling mightily, he strikes.
5
Is it bronze thunder in Mount Etna's breast,
That bubbles in a sulfurous brew?
Or is it Hades shattering his chains,
And throwing wide his gaping jaws?
It is the nation of an outcast slave
Igniting a high castle's moat,
Raining down steel and flame upon the valley
Where our well-chosen warriors,
Ringed all around by swamps and foes,
Storm the swift current into fire.
6
O, hide your forces, Istanbul,
In mountains, where the fiery sky
Belches out ashes, flames and death;
Beyond where Tigris scours its banks.
But in this world there is no barrier
That could curtail the eagles' flight.
They stop for naught: not waters, forests,
Hills, torrents or the wildest steppes.
The eagle legions can attain
Heights that are scaled by wind alone.
7
Let earth, like Pontus, heave and breathe,
Let all the world's expanses groan,
Let blackest smoke obscure the light
Moldavan peaks be drenched in blood;
But none of this can hinder you,
O Rus', for fate herself protects you
In blessed Anna's name.
And now your ardent zeal for Her
Carries you swift through Tatar ranks,
Cutting wide swathes for you to pass.
8
The day conceals its rays amidst the waves,
And leaves the fight to burn against night;
The Tatar prince has perished in the dark;
The Tatars loose both light and hope.
A wolf steals from the deepest woods
Toward the pallid Turkish corpse.
Then someone watching his last sunset,
Cries out, ""O, veil this crimson scene,
And cover up Muhammad's shame!
Sink like the sun into the sea!""
9
Why is my soul thus seized by fear?
My blood runs cold, my heart laments!
What sudden clamour strikes my ear?
The woods and desert wind are howling!
Fierce beasts are hiding in a cave,
The door of heaven opens wide,
Above the army, stormclouds part -
Then all at once the Hero enters,
His face aflame, he routs the foe
With blood-washed sword.
10
Is it not he, who razed the fortress
That threatened Rus' beside the flowing Don?
Is it not he who struck the Persians down
Amidst the thirsting reaches of the steppe?
Just such a gaze he cast upon his foes
When he debarked on Gothic shores,
Just such a mighty hand he raised,
And his steed galloped just as swift
When now his legions trampled the plains
That lie before the dawning day.
11
All round him from the clouds above
Rain thunderbolts and lightning,
And sensing Peter's forces nigh
The woodlands and fields lie trembling.
Who joins his fierce gaze to the south,
All cloaked in terrifying thunder?
It must be he the victor at Kazan,
Who by the Caspian's banks
Did overthrow the proud Selim -
And strew the steppe with Pagan heads.
12
One hero speaks now to the other:
""We did not toil in vain,
Nor were our exploits futile:
For now the world's in awe of Rus'.
Our work has broadened our frontiers
To north, to west and to the east.
And in the south, our Anna celebrates,
Bestows this triumph on her people.""
Now darkness closes round our heroes -
Conceals them from our eyes and ears.
13
The river swirls with Tatar blood
That's spilled among the warriors.
And fearing battle to rejoin,
The foe escapes across the barren land,
Abandons sword, encampment, shame,
They paint a ghastly sight while running
Through their slain brothers blood.
Even the slightest trembling leaf
Strikes fear into their hearts now
Like screaming cannonballs.
14
The woods and vales sing out with springs
""O, victory to Rus'! O, victory!""
The foe now fleeing Russian swords
Is terrified by of his own steps.
Then, seeing her own men in flight,
The moon, ashamed of their disgrace,
Doth blush and hide her face in gloom.
And glory flies in dark of night,
With trumpets to all lands to herald
The terrifying might of Rus'."
3190,Emotion,MemoryPoemsAMemoryOfThePlayersInAMirrorAtMidnightPoembyJamesJoyce,"They mouth love's language. Gnash
The thirteen teeth
Your lean jaws grin with. Lash
Your itch and quailing, nude greed of the flesh.
Love's breath in you is stale, worded or sung,
As sour as cat's breath,
Harsh of tongue.
This grey that stares
Lies not, stark skin and bone.
Leave greasy lips their kissing. None
Will choose her what you see to mouth upon.
Dire hunger holds his hour.
Pluck forth your heart, saltblood, a fruit of tears.
Pluck and devour!"
3191,Emotion,MemoryPoemsToTheMemoryOfLovePoembyDeeDaffodil,"Petals torn from faded roses,
Memories stored in jars.
Photographs with different poses,
To worship from afar.
Love has gone from her heart,
Sadness fills his soul.
What of the vow to never part?
To live two lives, as a whole?
Emptiness fills the days,
Loneliness the nights.
Through teary eyes filled with haze,
She remembers all their fights.
What of the love they shared?
Could it be it's only hiding?
Or has it simply disappeared,
from lack of simple trying?
It seems a waste, an awful shame,
That love should part,
Just as it came...
With very little effort.
Let's raise a glass-
To the memory of love."
3192,Emotion,MemoryPoemsJanglingMemoryPoembyKatherineMansfield,"Heavens above! here's an old tie of your--
Sea-green dragons stamped on a golden ground.
Ha! Ha! Ha!  What children we were in those days.
Do you love me enough to wear it now?
Have you the courage of your pristine glories?
Ha! Ha! Ha!  You laugh and shrug your shoulders.
Those were the days when a new tie spelt a fortune:
We wore it in turn--I flaunted it as a waist-belt.
Ha! Ha! Ha!  What easily satisfied babies.
""I think I'll turn into a piano duster.""
""Give it to me, I'll polish my slippers on it!""
Ha! Ha! Ha!  The rag's not worth the dustbin.
""Throw the shabby old thing right out of the window;
Fling it into the faces of other children!""
Ha! Ha! Ha!  We laughed and laughed till the tears
came!"
3193,Emotion,MemoryPoemsMemoryOfMyFatherPoembyPatrickKavanagh,"Every old man I see
Reminds me of my father
When he had fallen in love with death
One time when sheaves were gathered.
That man I saw in Gardner Street
Stumbled on the kerb was one,
He stared at me half-eyed,
I might have been his son.
And I remember the musician
Faltering over his fiddle
In Bayswater, London,
He too set me the riddle.
Every old man I see
In October-coloured weather
Seems to say to me:
""I was once your father."""
3194,Emotion,MemoryPoemsInMemoryOfMyMotherPoembyPatrickKavanagh,"I do not think of you lying in the wet clay
Of a Monaghan graveyard; I see
You walking down a lane among the poplars
On your way to the station, or happily
Going to second Mass on a summer Sunday -
You meet me and you say:
'Don't forget to see about the cattle - '
Among your earthiest words the angels stray.
And I think of you walking along a headland
Of green oats in June,
So full of repose, so rich with life -
And I see us meeting at the end of a town
On a fair day by accident, after
The bargains are all made and we can walk
Together through the shops and stalls and markets
Free in the oriental streets of thought.
O you are not lying in the wet clay,
For it is a harvest evening now and we
Are piling up the ricks against the moonlight
And you smile up at us - eternally."
3195,Emotion,MemoryPoemsTheOnionMemoryPoembyCraigRaine,"Divorced, but friends again at last,
we walk old ground together
in bright blue uncomplicated weather.
We laugh and pause
to hack to bits these tiny dinosaurs,
prehistoric, crenelated, cast
between the tractor ruts in mud.
On the green, a junior Douglas Fairbanks,
swinging on the chestnut's unlit chandelier,
defies the corporation spears--
a single rank around the bole,
rusty with blood.
Green, tacky phalluses curve up, romance
A gust--the old flag blazes on its pole.
In the village bakery
the pastry babies pass
from milky slump to crusty cadaver,
from crib to coffin--without palaver.
All's over in a flash,
too silently...
Tonight the arum lilies fold
back napkins monogrammed in gold,
crisp and laundered fresh.
Those crustaceous gladioli, on the sly,
reveal the crimson flower-flesh
inside their emerald armor plate.
The uncooked herrings blink a tearful eye.
The candles palpitate.
The Oistrakhs bow and scrape
in evening dress, on Emi-tape.
Outside the trees are bending over backwards
to please the wind : the shining sword
grass flattens on its belly.
The white-thorn's frillies offer no resistance.
In the fridge, a heart-shaped jelly
strives to keep a sense of balance.
I slice up the onions. You sew up a dress.
This is the quiet echo--flesh--
white muscle on white muscle,
intimately folded skin,
finished with a satin rustle.
One button only to undo, sewn up with shabby thread.
It is the onion, memory,
that makes me cry.
Because there's everything and nothing to be said,
the clock with hands held up before its face,
stammers softly on, trying to complete a phrase--
while we, together and apart,
repeat unfinished festures got by heart.
And afterwards, I blunder with the washing on the line--
headless torsos, faceless lovers, friends of mine."
3196,Emotion,MemoryPoemsAfterTheFuneralInMemoryOfAnnJonesPoembyDylanThomas,"After the funeral, mule praises, brays,
Windshake of sailshaped ears, muffle-toed tap
Tap happily of one peg in the thick
Grave's foot, blinds down the lids, the teeth in black,
The spittled eyes, the salt ponds in the sleeves,
Morning smack of the spade that wakes up sleep,
Shakes a desolate boy who slits his throat
In the dark of the coffin and sheds dry leaves,
That breaks one bone to light with a judgment clout'
After the feast of tear-stuffed time and thistles
In a room with a stuffed fox and a stale fern,
I stand, for this memorial's sake, alone
In the snivelling hours with dead, humped Ann
Whose hodded, fountain heart once fell in puddles
Round the parched worlds of Wales and drowned each sun
(Though this for her is a monstrous image blindly
Magnified out of praise; her death was a still drop;
She would not have me sinking in the holy
Flood of her heart's fame; she would lie dumb and deep
And need no druid of her broken body).
But I, Ann's bard on a raised hearth, call all
The seas to service that her wood-tongud virtue
Babble like a bellbuoy over the hymning heads,
Bow down the walls of the ferned and foxy woods
That her love sing and swing through a brown chapel,
Blees her bent spirit with four, crossing birds.
Her flesh was meek as milk, but this skyward statue
With the wild breast and blessed and giant skull
Is carved from her in a room with a wet window
In a fiercely mourning house in a crooked year.
I know her scrubbed and sour humble hands
Lie with religion in their cramp, her threadbare
Whisper in a damp word, her wits drilled hollow,
Her fist of a face died clenched on a round pain;
And sculptured Ann is seventy years of stone.
These cloud-sopped, marble hands, this monumental
Argument of the hewn voice, gesture and psalm
Storm me forever over her grave until
The stuffed lung of the fox twitch and cry Love
And the strutting fern lay seeds on the black sill."
3197,Emotion,MemoryPoemsInMemoryOfSirCurleyPoembyPatriciaGale,"Beautiful brown mixed with black and white
Eyes that sparkled with the call of going out into nature
Faithful and loyal, true friendship
A darken morning you went out the door
Passed your boundaries not a sound was heard
Helpless and injured
A single insensitive human act
Left me crying and you fighting for your life
How could they just drive away, leave you there?
You tried to fight but time had taken its toll
Younger days had graced your eyes
And the canine pup had seen eleven years pass
I held you in my arms as he said there’s no hope
As your final breath was drawn
We said goodbye and my heart will never be the same
We moved to the country for room to run
Now you run heaven’s golden streets
I lost my best friend from one act from an insensitive human
I took you home to your final resting place
Beside your favorite spot, the big red barn
Near the garden where we played
I wonder this house empty and void
A piece of me lays out back near the big red barn
And your picture remains on the fireplace
In memory of Sir Curley who died April 18,2007
My friend and companion for eleven years
The most loyal German Shepherd a woman could have"

Shall tell of the deeds that thy children have done,
When the strains of each poet shall sing of their glory,
And the triumphs their skill and their valour have won.
When the olive and palm in thy chaplet are blended,
When thy arts, and thy fame, and thy commerce increase,
When thy arms through the uttermost coasts are extended,
And thy war is triumphant, and happy thy peace;
When the ocean, whose waves like a rampart flow round thee,
Conveying thy mandates to every shore,
And the empire of nature no longer can bound thee,
And the world be the scene of thy conquests no more:
Remember the man who in sorrow and danger,
When thy glory was set, and thy spirit was low,
When thy hopes were o'erturned by the arms of the stranger,
And thy banners displayed in the halls of the foe,
Stood forth in the tempest of doubt and disaster,
Unaided, and single, the danger to brave.
Asserted thy claims, and the rights of his master,
Preserved thee to conquer, and saved thee to save."

At the departure of the sun;
So from the honeysuckle sheaves
The bee goes when the day is done;
So sits the turtle when she is but one,
And so all woe, as I since she is gone.
To some few birds kind Nature hath
Made all the summer as one day:
Which once enjoy'd, cold winter's wrath
As night they sleeping pass away.
Those happy creatures are, that know not yet
The pain to be deprived or to forget.
I oft have heard men say there be
Some that with confidence profess
The helpful Art of Memory:
But could they teach Forgetfulness,
I'd learn; and try what further art could do
To make me love her and forget her too."
3200,Emotion,MemoryPoemsElegyToTheMemoryOfWerterPoembyMaryDarbyRobinson,"""With female Fairies will thy tomb be haunted
""And worms will not come to thee."" SHAKSPERE.
WHEN from Day's closing eye the lucid tears
Fall lightly on the bending lily's head;
When o'er the blushing sky night's curtains spread,
And the tall mountain's summit scarce appears;
When languid Evening, sinking to repose,
Her filmy mantle o'er the landscape throws;
Of THEE I'll sing; and as the mournful song
Glides in slow numbers the dark woods among;
My wand'ring steps shall seek the lonely shade,
Where all thy virtues, all thy griefs are laid!
Yes, hopeless suff'rer, friendless and forlorn,
Sweet victim of love's power; the silent tear
Shall oft at twilight's close, and glimm'ring morn
Gem the pale primrose that adorns thy bier,
And as the balmy dew ascends to heaven,
Thy crime shall steal away, thy frailty be forgiv'n.
Oft by the moon's wan beam the love-lorn maid,
Led by soft SYMPATHY, shall stroll along;
Oft shall she listen in the Lime-tree's * shade,
Her cold blood freezing at the night-owl's song:
Or, when she hears the death-bell's solemn sound,
Her light steps echoing o'er the hollow ground;
Oft shall the trickling tear adorn her cheek,
Thy pow'r, O SENSIBILITY ! in magic charms to speak!
For the poor PILGRIM, doom'd afar to roam
From the dear comforts of his native home,
A glitt'ring star puts forth a silv'ry ray,
Soothes his sad heart, and marks his tedious way;
The short-liv'd radiance cheers the gloom of night,
And decks Heaven's murky dome with transitory light.
So from the mournful CHARLOTTE's dark-orb'd lids,
The sainted tear of pitying VIRTUE flows;
And the last boon, the ""churlish priest"" forbids,
On thy lone grave the sacred drop bestows;
There shall the sparkling dews of Evening shine,
AND HEAVEN'S OWN INCENSE CONSECRATE THE SHRINE."

Plays the keys
Of my heart
Just like a Baby Grand
The melody-the tune
All off key
In an orchestra
Of fine tuned instruments
I follow the music
With my minds eye
To where-ever it leads me
And into the depths of Ballads
Of  'HeartBreak'
I, at last find myself
Locked-tethered-chained
To memories, bitter and sweet
Despairing and off key with no
Harmony, in the least
A re-write is in order, STAT
A re-play-a fine tuning, immediately
A re-awakening, a re-newing-NOW:
Of Hope
Of Hope That Sings
You know, that feeling, with wings"

Travelling down the memory lane

Travelling down the memory lane

3204,Emotion,MemoryPoemsMemoryPoembySiegfriedSassoon,"When I was young my heart and head were light,
And I was gay and feckless as a colt
Out in the fields, with morning in the may,
Wind on the grass, wings in the orchard bloom.
O thrilling sweet, my joy, when life was free
And all the paths led on from hawthorn-time
Across the carolling meadows into June.
But now my heart is heavy-laden. I sit
Burning my dreams away beside the fire:
For death has made me wise and bitter and strong;
And I am rich in all that I have lost.
O starshine on the fields of long-ago,
Bring me the darkness and the nightingale;
Dim wealds of vanished summer, peace of home,
And silence; and the faces of my friends."

With scarlet roses tinting her green breast,
And mating thrushes ushering in her day,
And Earth on tiptoe for her golden guest,
I always see the evening when we met--
The first of June baptized in tender rain--
And walked home through the wide streets, gleaming wet,
Arms locked, our warm flesh pulsing with love's pain.
I always see the cheerful little room,
And in the corner, fresh and white, the bed,
Sweet scented with a delicate perfume,
Wherein for one night only we were wed;
Where in the starlit stillness we lay mute,
And heard the whispering showers all night long,
And your brown burning body was a lute
Whereon my passion played his fevered song.
When June comes dancing o'er the death of May,
With scarlet roses staining her fair feet,
My soul takes leave of me to sing all day
A love so fugitive and so complete."

Which takes you back to that moment again,
When memories flow and scenes are set,
And you, once more, relive the time you met.
How perfect, were those days back then,
Those days of romance, and the instant, when
Love hit you with a painful jolt,
And exquisite pain, you didn't want to halt,
And playing along was a haunting refrain,
So let it now take you, down memory lane.

3208,Emotion,MemoryPoemsInMemoryOfMBPoembyAnnaAkhmatova,"Here is my gift, not roses on your grave,
not sticks of burning incense.
You lived aloof, maintaining to the end
your magnificent disdain.
You drank wine, and told the wittiest jokes,
and suffocated inside stifling walls.
Alone you let the terrible stranger in,
and stayed with her alone.
Now you're gone, and nobody says a word
about your troubled and exalted life.
Only my voice, like a flute, will mourn
at your dumb funeral feast.
Oh, who would have dared believe that half-crazed I
, I, sick with grief for the buried past,
I, smoldering on a slow fire,
having lost everything and forgotten all,
would be fated to commemorate a man
so full of strength and will and bright inventions,
who only yesterday it seems, chatted with me,
hiding the tremor of his mortal pain."
3209,Emotion,MemoryPoemsInMemoryOfEvaGoreBoothAndConMarkiewiczPoembyWilliamButlerYeats,"The light of evening, Lissadell,
Great windows open to the south,
Two girls in silk kimonos, both
Beautiful, one a gazelle.
But a raving autumn shears
Blossom from the summer's wreath;
The older is condemned to death,
Pardoned, drags out lonely years
Conspiring among the ignorant.
I know not what the younger dreams -
Some vague Utopia - and she seems,
When withered old and skeleton-gaunt,
An image of such politics.
Many a time I think to seek
One or the other out and speak
Of that old Georgian mansion, mix
pictures of the mind, recall
That table and the talk of youth,
Two girls in silk kimonos, both
Beautiful, one a gazelle.
Dear shadows, now you know it all,
All the folly of a fight
With a common wrong or right.
The innocent and the beautiful.
Have no enemy but time;
Arise and bid me strike a match
And strike another till time catch;
Should the conflagration climb,
Run till all the sages know.
We the great gazebo built,
They convicted us of guilt;
Bid me strike a match and blow."
3210,Emotion,MemoryPoemsHerMemoryOfThePicnicPoembyTimothySteele,"To finger-sponge crust crumbs of fruit meringue
(Grass prickling through the blanket-tablecloth);
To climb the shading oak; to roll and hang
Inverted from a branch, as if a sloth;
And, after dropping neatly from the branch,
To pull a cup off of a tube of cups;
To grab a towel hurriedly to stanch
A soda which, on opening, erupts—
This was to be there thirty years ago,
A time constrained and hurtful, yet the day
Now has the settled warmth of a tableau.
Cloud stacks stand whitely, farmlands stretch away,
While her two brothers, in a make-believe
World Series, wave their baseball gloves and run
About the meadow as they stab and heave
Each other blinding high-flies in the sun.
Her uncle, to distract and to compose
An argument between his daughters, lies
Upon his back and eye-catchingly blows
Smoke rings which grayly loosen as they rise.
Her parents will divorce within a year,
But neither fully grasps the crisis yet:
They kneel and wrap leftovers and appear
Absorbed in a congenial tête-à-tête.
And she can walk the meadow at her ease,
Switching the tall grass with an osier wand;
Can hear the white-throats in the woods reprise
The long rich notes with which they correspond;
Can spread and duck through a barbed wire fence;
Can sit on, horseback style, a fallen tree
While grasshoppers perform leaps so immense
They seem beyond the claims of gravity.
This idyll will be, she intuits, brief;
The fabric of the family will tear.
Yet this can't change the bittersweet belief
That pleasure's no less true for being rare;
Nor can it wholly undermine her sense
That though well-muscled follies hound and press,
What counts most is her own intelligence,
However cramped by grief and loneliness.
And even now, a cousin waves to her
And blows a summons through a trumpet-fist:
She's off to pick wildflowers and would prefer
To do so with a comrade botanist.
Investigating where the field declines
To marsh land, the two harvest or reprieve
Pinks, yellow bells, and long-spurred columbines
Till voices call them that it's time to leave.
Regretting his departure from the wild,
A stuffed bear's carried off; the sun moves west;
Her aunt holds on her hip her youngest child;
The slushed ice is dumped brusquely from its chest.
Caps are screwed back on thermoses and jars;
Her two ball-playing brothers pool their talents,
Porting between them a hamper to the cars,
Their outer arms held straining out for balance.
And if the meadows grow more darkly gold,
As though withdrawing now from living fact,
The blanket brushed, she and her mother fold
It up in squares increasingly compact.
She shinnies out the oak to roll and swing
A last time underneath the limb's rough girth,
Then hangs by hands, and lets go, fathoming
The distance of her drop back to the earth."

Blessed was our first age and morning-time. Then were no
waies tarren, ne no cars numberen, but each followed his owne
playing-busyness to go about singly or by large interspaces,
for to leden his viage after his luste and layen under clene hedge.
Jungling there was not, nor the overtaking wheele, and all those
now cruel clarions were full-hushed and full-still. Then nobile
horses, lest they should make the chariots moveable to run by
cause of this new feare, we did not press, and were apayed by
sweete thankes of him that drave. There was not cursings ne
adventure of death blinded bankes betweene, but good-fellowship

3212,Emotion,MemoryPoemsToTheMemoryOfMrOldhamPoembyJohnDryden,"Farewell, too little and too lately known,
Whom I began to think and call my own;
For sure our souls were near allied, and thine
Cast in the same poetic mould with mine.
One common note on either lyre did strike,
And knaves and fools we both abhorred alike.
To the same goal did both our studies drive;
The last set out the soonest did arrive.
Thus Nisus fell upon the slippery place,
While his young friend performed and won the race.
O early ripe! to thy abundant store
What could advancing age have added more?
It might (what Nature never gives the young)
Have taught the numbers of thy native tongue.
But satire needs not those, and wit will shine
Through the harsh cadence of a rugged line.
A noble error, and but seldom made,
When poets are by too much force betrayed.
Thy generous fruits, though gathered ere their prime,
Still showed a quickness; and maturing time
But mellows what we write to the dull sweets of rhyme.
Once more, hail and farewell! farewell, thou young,
But ah too short, Marcellus of our tongue!
Thy brows with ivy and with laurels bound;
But fate and gloomy night encompass thee around."

‘you have so many memories…’

‘if there’s anything…’

sustained by every moment of love freely given; for
the whole creation is one single act of love.

3214,Emotion,MemoryPoemsMemoryPoembyAnneBrontë,"Brightly the sun of summer shone,
Green fields and waving woods upon,
And soft winds wandered by;
Above, a sky of purest blue,
Around, bright flowers of loveliest hue,
Allured the gazer's eye.
But what were all these charms to me,
When one sweet breath of memory
Came gently wafting by?
I closed my eyes against the day,
And called my willing soul away,
From earth, and air, and sky;
That I might simply fancy there
One little flower -- a primrose fair,
Just opening into sight;
As in the days of infancy,
An opening primrose seemed to me
A source of strange delight.
Sweet Memory! ever smile on me;
Nature's chief beauties spring from thee,
Oh, still thy tribute bring!
Still make the golden crocus shine
Among the flowers the most divine,
The glory of the spring.
Still in the wall-flower's fragrance dwell;
And hover round the slight blue bell,
My childhood's darling flower.
Smile on the little daisy still,
The buttercup's bright goblet fill
With all thy former power.
For ever hang thy dreamy spell
Round mountain star and heather bell,
And do not pass away
From sparkling frost, or wreathed snow,
And whisper when the wild winds blow,
Or rippling waters play.
Is childhood, then, so all divine?
Or Memory, is the glory thine,
That haloes thus the past?
Not all divine; its pangs of grief,
(Although, perchance, their stay be brief,)
Are bitter while they last.
Nor is the glory all thine own,
For on our earliest joys alone
That holy light is cast.
With such a ray, no spell of thine
Can make our later pleasures shine,
Though long ago they passed.
Acton"
3215,Emotion,MemoryPoemsBigBrotherInMemoryOfPaulPoembyFredaSatterfield,"When I look upon a photograph.
Not so long ago, not so faded.
A picture of my beloved big brother.
The memories had filled my mind.
The times we cried and the times we laughed.
How brother watches over me,
Makes sure I'm not hurt.
When I was sick, he made my lunch.
We'd go on shopping trips.
We thought we would grow old together.
Through the years we thought it was true.
Brother and I worked on model trains.
Then time had come to call.
My big brother had to go.
He passed away, he went to eternal sleep.
God is holding him as he sleeps.
Until he comes to call.
All I have are memories and a photograph.
In memory of big brother Paul."
3216,Emotion,MemoryPoemsInMemoryOfAHappyDayInFebruaryPoembyAnneBrontë,"Blessed be Thou for all the joy
My soul has felt today!
O let its memory stay with me
And never pass away!
I was alone, for those I loved
Were far away from me,
The sun shone on the withered grass,
The wind blew fresh and free.
Was it the smile of early spring
That made my bosom glow?
'Twas sweet, but neither sun nor wind
Could raise my spirit so.
Was it some feeling of delight,
All vague and undefined?
No, 'twas a rapture deep and strong,
Expanding in the mind!
Was it a sanguine view of life
And all its transient bliss­-
A hope of bright prosperity?
O no, it was not this!
It was a glimpse of truth divine
Unto my spirit given
Illumined by a ray of light
That shone direct from heaven!
I felt there was a God on high
By whom all things were made.
I saw His wisdom and his power
In all his works displayed.
But most throughout the moral world
I saw his glory shine;
I saw His wisdom infinite,
His mercy all divine.
Deep secrets of his providence
In darkness long concealed
Were brought to my delighted eyes
And graciously revealed.
But while I wondered and adored
His wisdom so divine,
I did not tremble at his power,
I felt that God was mine.
I knew that my Redeemer lived,
I did not fear to die;
Full sure that I should rise again
To immortality.
I longed to view that bliss divine
Which eye hath never seen,
To see the glories of his face
Without the veil between."
3217,Emotion,MemoryPoemsAMemoryOfYouthPoembyWilliamButlerYeats,"THE moments passed as at a play;
I had the wisdom love brings forth;
I had my share of mother-wit,
And yet for all that I could say,
And though I had her praise for it,
A cloud blown from the cut-throat North
Suddenly hid Love's moon away.
Believing every word I said,
I praised her body and her mind
Till pride had made her eyes grow bright,
And pleasure made her cheeks grow red,
And vanity her footfall light,
Yet we, for all that praise, could find
Nothing but darkness overhead.
We sat as silent as a stone,
We knew, though she'd not said a word,
That even the best of love must die,
And had been savagely undone
Were it not that Love upon the cry
Of a most ridiculous little bird
Tore from the clouds his marvellous moon.
ALTHOUGH crowds gathered once if she but showed her face,
And even old men's eyes grew dim, this hand alone,
Like some last courtier at a gypsy camping-place
Babbling of fallen majesty, records what's gone.
These lineaments, a heart that laughter has made sweet,
These, these remain, but I record what-s gone.  A crowd
Will gather, and not know it walks the very street
Whereon a thing once walked that seemed a burning cloud"

remembering your mother's face
turned to water under the white words

though she tells it better than i do,

no rage, no shame, none of it

3219,Emotion,MemoryPoemsMemoryPicturesPoembyLucyMaudMontgomery,"I
A wide-spring meadow in a rosy dawn
Bedropt with virgin buds; an orient sky
Fleeced with a dappled cloud but half withdrawn;
A mad wind blowing by,
O'er slopes of rippling grass and glens apart;
A brackened path to a wild-woodland place
A limpid pool with a fair, laughing face
Mirrored within its heart.
II
An ancient garden brimmed with summer sun
Upon a still and slumberous afternoon;
Old walks and pleasances with shadows spun
Where honeyed odors swoon;
A velvet turf with blossoms garlanded;
A hedge of Mary-lilies white and tall;
And, shining out against a lichened wall,
A stately-golden head.
III
An autumn hilltop in the sunset hue,
Pine boughs uptossed against the crystal west,
And, girdled with the twilight dim and blue,
A valley peace-possessed;
A high-sprung heaven stained with colors rare,
A sheen of moonrise on the sea afar,
And, bright and soft as any glimmering star,
Eyes holy as a prayer."
3220,Emotion,MemoryPoemsTheSongThatTriggersMyMemoryPoembyLauraCummings,"As she lay dying with the radio playing softly in the background,
The notes of a song so sweet tickled and triggered her memory,
Number one in the charts the week she was born,
Playing at her eighteenth birthday party as she floated and swayed in a glorious dance,
The first dance with her first and only boyfriend was during this melody,
Playing at their wedding as a song they claimed ‘theirs’,
Playing its gentle coaxing notes as she made love with her husband on their wedding night,
Had danced and spun to it with her children, spinning them in her arms until all fell to the floor in a dizzy heap,
Now it plays softly in the background as her life slowly trickles away from her,
As she loses that once firm hold on a life so dear,
Triggering her memory to a life that would end with the last single note of a now bittersweet symphony."
3221,Emotion,MemoryPoemsAMemoryPoembyBarcroftHenryThomasBoake,"Adown the grass-grown paths we strayed,
The evening cowslips ope’d
Their yellow eyes to look at her,
The love-sick lilies moped
With envy that she rather chose
To take a creamy-petalled rose
And lean it 'gainst her ebon hair,
All in that garden fair.
A languid breeze, with stolen scent
Of box-bloom in his grasp,
Sighed out his longing in her ear,
And with his dying gasp
Scattered the perfume at her feet
To blend with others not less sweet;
He loved her, but she did not care,
All in that garden fair.
The rose she honoured nodded down,
His comrades burst with spite:
Poor fool! he knew not he was doomed
To barely last the night;
Are hearts to her but as that flower,
The plaything of a careless hour,
To lacerate and never spare
All in that garden fair.
I held her hand that I might trace
Her fortune in its palm;
A bolder moonbeam than the rest
Crept up and kissed her arm,
And, kissing once, was loth to leave,
So hid himself within the sleeve
That clasped the lithe arm, white and bare,
All in that garden fair.
I traced her fortune: love and wealth,-
Tho’ life, alas! was short,
But will that wealth be bought with love?
Or love with wealth be bought?
I know not, knowing only this -
Her hand seemed waiting for a kiss,
I longed to, but I did not dare
All in that garden fair.
But she, alas! is not for me,
And I am not for her;
Yet ever deep within my thoughts
A faint regret must stir
A thrill of longing - that among
Those moonlit paths with lover's tongue
I might return, and woo her there
All in that garden fair."
3222,Emotion,MemoryPoemsARingOfMemoryPoembyCJHeck,"She found his ring
the other day
where she had put it
safe, away.
Like a key
its lock undone
the ring brought memories
one by one.
‘With this ring’
the preacher read,
promises given,
vows were said.
The time was short
to the ‘death do us’ part
and now his home
was in her heart.
A single tear fell
from her eye.
It always did that,
made her cry.
She kissed the ring,
tucked it back away
and locked up the memories.
No more today."

3227,Emotion,MemoryPoemsTwoSonnetsInMemoryPoembyEdnaStVincentMillay,"(Nicola Sacco -- Bartolomeo Vanzetti)
Executed August 23, 1927
I
As men have loved their lovers in times past
And sung their wit, their virtue and their grace,
So have we loved sweet Justice to the last,
That now lies here in an unseemly place.
The child will quit the cradle and grow wise
And stare on beauty till his senses drown;
Yet shall be seen no more by mortal eyes
Such beauty as here walked and here went down.
Like birds that hear the winter crying plain
Her courtiers leave to seek the clement south;
Many have praised her, we alone remain
To break a fist against the lying mouth
Of any man who says this was not so:
Though she be dead now, as indeed we know.
II
Where can the heart be hidden in the ground
And be at peace, and be at peace forever,
Under the world, untroubled by the sound
Of mortal tears, that cease from pouring never?
Well for the heart, by stern compassion harried,
If death be deeper than the churchmen say, --
Gone from this world indeed what's graveward carried,
And laid to rest indeed what's laid away.
Anguish enough while yet the indignant breather
Have blood to spurt upon the oppressor's hand;
Who would eternal be, and hang in ether
A stuffless ghost above his struggling land,
Retching in vain to render up the groan
That is not there, being aching dust's alone?"
3228,Emotion,MemoryPoemsYourMemoryStaysOnPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"Your memory stays on
While you are long gone
A typical down to earth hero
As you look from up to down below
Stories of you will continue to grow and flow
Your memory stays on
They will remember you for your ups and downs
They will remember you for all the moments
You played a part and were around
Your memory stays on
You were a simple exceptional man
Making mistakes like any human
Your peak was when you took charge of football
Whilst your downfall was alcohol
The decider of your final call
Your memory stays on and will never run
Your achievement in football will always somehow return
We will miss you with each and every rising sun

3229,Emotion,MemoryPoems004june207InTheTempleOfMemoryPoembyMaxReif,"I speak to you easily,
shadowy figure in my mmeory,
reliving all your picaresque adventures
pulled out as from a volume on a shelf,
dazzled by all the color and the drama,
each episode pulling Light
improbably from the dark.
I follow all your travels,
converse with you about the cities
where you could feel
forotten amid the lighted towers,
then big and warm at a performance
or a party in your honor.
Your tale is replayed to guitar chords
and whining harmonica strains,
realized in pure colors and words,
etched in the values
painted upon the canvas of life.
You move so comfortably
across these horizons
of the theater of memory.
Yet you, who sit recalling —
where
you
should go,
what
you
should do,
and what I can say to you,
I do not know."
3230,Emotion,MemoryPoemsToThePiousMemoryOfTheAccomplishedYoungLadyMrsAnneKilligrewPoembyJohnDryden,"Thou youngest virgin-daughter of the skies,
Made in the last promotion of the Blest;
Whose palms, new pluck'd from Paradise,
In spreading branches more sublimely rise,
Rich with immortal green above the rest:
Whether, adopted to some neighbouring star,
Thou roll'st above us, in thy wand'ring race,
Or, in procession fix'd and regular,
Mov'd with the Heavens' majestic pace:
Or, call'd to more superior bliss,
Thou tread'st, with seraphims, the vast abyss.
What ever happy region is thy place,
Cease thy celestial song a little space;
(Thou wilt have time enough for hymns divine,
Since Heav'n's eternal year is thine.)
Hear then a mortal Muse thy praise rehearse,
In no ignoble verse;
But such as thy own voice did practise here,
When thy first fruits of poesy were giv'n;
To make thyself a welcome inmate there:
While yet a young probationer,
And Candidate of Heav'n.
If by traduction came thy mind,
Our wonder is the less to find
A soul so charming from a stock so good;
Thy father was transfus'd into thy blood:
So wert thou born into the tuneful strain,
(An early, rich, and inexhausted vein.)
But if thy preexisting soul
Was form'd, at first, with myriads more,
It did through all the mighty poets roll,
Who Greek or Latin laurels wore,
And was that Sappho last, which once it was before.
If so, then cease thy flight, O Heav'n-born mind!
Thou hast no dross to purge from thy rich ore:
Nor can thy soul a fairer mansion find,
Than was the beauteous frame she left behind:
Return, to fill or mend the choir, of thy celestial kind.
May we presume to say, that at thy birth,
New joy was sprung in Heav'n as well as here on earth.
For sure the milder planets did combine
On thy auspicious horoscope to shine,
And ev'n the most malicious were in trine.
Thy brother-angels at thy birth
Strung each his lyre, and tun'd it high,
That all the people of the sky
Might know a poetess was born on earth;
And then if ever, mortal ears
Had heard the music of the spheres!
And if no clust'ring swarm of bees
On thy sweet mouth distill'd their golden dew,
'Twas that, such vulgar miracles,
Heav'n had not leisure to renew:
For all the blest fraternity of love
Solemniz'd there thy birth, and kept thy Holyday above.
O Gracious God! How far have we
Profan'd thy Heav'nly gift of poesy?
Made prostitute and profligate the Muse,
Debas'd to each obscene and impious use,
Whose harmony was first ordain'd above
For tongues of angels, and for hymns of love?
O wretched we! why were we hurried down
This lubrique and adult'rate age,
(Nay added fat pollutions of our own)
T'increase the steaming ordures of the stage?
What can we say t'excuse our Second Fall?
Let this thy vestal, Heav'n, atone for all!
Her Arethusian stream remains unsoil'd,
Unmix'd with foreign filth, and undefil'd,
Her wit was more than man, her innocence a child!
Art she had none, yet wanted none:
For Nature did that want supply,
So rich in treasures of her own,
She might our boasted stores defy:
Such noble vigour did her verse adorn,
That it seem'd borrow'd, where 'twas only born.
Her morals too were in her bosom bred
By great examples daily fed,
What in the best of Books, her Father's Life, she read.
And to be read her self she need not fear,
Each test, and ev'ry light, her Muse will bear,
Though Epictetus with his lamp were there.
Ev'n love (for love sometimes her Muse express'd)
Was but a lambent-flame which play'd about her breast:
Light as the vapours of a morning dream,
So cold herself, whilst she such warmth express'd,
'Twas Cupid bathing in Diana's stream.
Born to the spacious empire of the Nine,
One would have thought, she should have been content
To manage well that mighty government;
But what can young ambitious souls confine?
To the next realm she stretch'd her sway,
For painture near adjoining lay,
A plenteous province, and alluring prey.
A chamber of dependences was fram'd,
(As conquerors will never want pretence,
When arm'd, to justify th'offence)
And the whole fief, in right of poetry she claim'd.
The country open lay without defence:
For poets frequent inroads there had made,
And perfectly could represent
The shape, the face, with ev'ry lineament:
And all the large domains which the Dumb-sister sway'd,
All bow'd beneath her government,
Receiv'd in triumph wheresoe'er she went,
Her pencil drew, what e'er her soul design'd,
And oft the happy draught surpass'd the image in her mind.
The sylvan scenes of herds and flocks,
And fruitful plains and barren rocks,
Of shallow brooks that flow'd so clear,
The bottom did the top appear;
Of deeper too and ampler floods,
Which as in mirrors, show'd the woods;
Of lofty trees, with sacred shades,
And perspectives of pleasant glades,
Where nymphs of brightest form appear,
And shaggy satyrs standing near,
Which them at once admire and fear.
The ruins too of some majestic piece,
Boasting the pow'r of ancient Rome or Greece,
Whose statues, friezes, columns broken lie,
And tho' defac'd, the wonder of the eye,
What Nature, art, bold fiction e'er durst frame,
Her forming hand gave feature to the name.
So strange a concourse ne'er was seen before,
But when the peopl'd Ark the whole creation bore.
The scene then chang'd, with bold erected look
Our martial king the sight with reverence strook:
For not content t'express his outward part,
Her hand call'd out the image of his heart,
His warlike mind, his soul devoid of fear,
His high-designing thoughts, were figur'd there,
As when, by magic, ghosts are made appear.
Our phoenix queen was portray'd too so bright,
Beauty alone could beauty take so right:
Her dress, her shape, her matchless grace,
Were all observ'd, as well as heav'nly face.
With such a peerless majesty she stands,
As in that day she took the crown from sacred hands:
Before a train of heroines was seen,
In beauty foremost, as in rank, the queen!
Thus nothing to her genius was deny'd,
But like a ball of fire the further thrown,
Still with a greater blaze she shone,
And her bright soul broke out on ev'ry side.
What next she had design'd, Heaven only knows,
To such immod'rate growth her conquest rose,
That fate alone its progress could oppose.
Now all those charms, that blooming grace,
The well-proportion'd shape, and beauteous face,
Shall never more be seen by mortal eyes;
In earth the much lamented virgin lies!
Not wit, not piety could fate prevent;
Nor was the cruel destiny content
To finish all the murder at a blow,
To sweep at once her life, and beauty too;
But, like a harden'd felon, took a pride
To work more mischievously slow,
And plunder'd first, and then destroy'd.
O double sacrilege on things divine,
To rob the relique, and deface the shrine!
But thus Orinda died:
Heav'n, by the same disease, did both translate,
As equal were their souls, so equal was their fate.
Meantime her warlike brother on the seas
His waving streamers to the winds displays,
And vows for his return, with vain devotion, pays.
Ah, generous youth, that wish forbear,
The winds too soon will waft thee here!
Slack all thy sails, and fear to come,
Alas, thou know'st not, thou art wreck'd at home!
No more shalt thou behold thy sister's face,
Thou hast already had her last embrace.
But look aloft, and if thou ken'st from far,
Among the Pleiad's, a new-kindl'd star,
If any sparkles, than the rest, more bright,
'Tis she that shines in that propitious light.
When in mid-air, the golden trump shall sound,
To raise the nations under ground;
When in the valley of Jehosophat,
The Judging God shall close the book of fate;
And there the last Assizes keep,
For those who wake, and those who sleep;
When rattling bones together fly,
From the four corners of the sky,
When sinews o'er the skeletons are spread,
Those cloth'd with flesh, and life inspires the dead;
The sacred poets first shall hear the sound,
And foremost from the tomb shall bound:
For they are cover'd with the lightest ground,
And straight, with in-born vigour, on the wing,
Like mounting larks, to the new morning sing.
There thou, sweet saint, before the choir shall go,
As harbinger of Heav'n, the way to show,
The way which thou so well hast learn'd below."
3231,Emotion,MemoryPoemsAveAtqueValeInMemoryOfCharlesBaudelairePoembyAlgernonCharlesSwinburne,"SHALL I strew on thee rose or rue or laurel,
Brother, on this that was the veil of thee?
Or quiet sea-flower moulded by the sea,
Or simplest growth of meadow-sweet or sorrel,
Such as the summer-sleepy Dryads weave,
Waked up by snow-soft sudden rains at eve?
Or wilt thou rather, as on earth before,
Half-faded fiery blossoms, pale with heat
And full of bitter summer, but more sweet
To thee than gleanings of a northern shore
Trod by no tropic feet?
For always thee the fervid languid glories
Allured of heavier suns in mightier skies;
Thine ears knew all the wandering watery sighs
Where the sea sobs round Lesbian promontories,
The barren kiss of piteous wave to wave
That knows not where is that Leucadian grave
Which hides too deep the supreme head of song.
Ah, salt and sterile as her kisses were,
The wild sea winds her and the green gulfs bear
Hither and thither, and vex and work her wrong,
Blind gods that cannot spare.
Thou sawest, in thine old singing season, brother,
Secrets and sorrows unbeheld of us:
Fierce loves, and lovely leaf-buds poisonous,
Bare to thy subtler eye, but for none other
Blowing by night in some unbreathed-in clime;
The hidden harvest of luxurious time,
Sin without shape, and pleasure without speech;
And where strange dreams in a tumultuous sleep
Make the shut eyes of stricken spirits weep;
And with each face thou sawest the shadow on each,
Seeing as men sow men reap.
O sleepless heart and sombre soul unsleeping,
That were athirst for sleep and no more life
And no more love, for peace and no more strife!
Now the dim gods of death have in their keeping
Spirit and body and all the springs of song,
Is it well now where love can do no wrong,
Where stingless pleasure has no foam or fang
Behind the unopening closure of her lips?
Is it not well where soul from body slips
And flesh from bone divides without a pang
As dew from flower-bell drips?
It is enough; the end and the beginning
Are one thing to thee, who art past the end.
O hand unclasp'd of unbeholden friend,
For thee no fruits to pluck, no palms for winning,
No triumph and no labour and no lust,
Only dead yew-leaves and a little dust.
O quiet eyes wherein the light saith naught,
Whereto the day is dumb, nor any night
With obscure finger silences your sight,
Nor in your speech the sudden soul speaks thought,
Sleep, and have sleep for light.
Now all strange hours and all strange loves are over,
Dreams and desires and sombre songs and sweet,
Hast thou found place at the great knees and feet
Of some pale Titan-woman like a lover,
Such as thy vision here solicited,
Under the shadow of her fair vast head,
The deep division of prodigious breasts,
The solemn slope of mighty limbs asleep,
The weight of awful tresses that still keep
The savour and shade of old-world pine-forests
Where the wet hill-winds weep?
Hast thou found any likeness for thy vision?
O gardener of strange flowers, what bud, what bloom,
Hast thou found sown, what gather'd in the gloom?
What of despair, of rapture, of derision,
What of life is there, what of ill or good?
Are the fruits gray like dust or bright like blood?
Does the dim ground grow any seed of ours,
The faint fields quicken any terrene root,
In low lands where the sun and moon are mute
And all the stars keep silence? Are there flowers
At all, or any fruit?
Alas, but though my flying song flies after,
O sweet strange elder singer, thy more fleet
Singing, and footprints of thy fleeter feet,
Some dim derision of mysterious laughter
From the blind tongueless warders of the dead,
Some gainless glimpse of Proserpine's veil'd head,
Some little sound of unregarded tears
Wept by effaced unprofitable eyes,
And from pale mouths some cadence of dead sighs--
These only, these the hearkening spirit hears,
Sees only such things rise.
Thou art far too far for wings of words to follow,
Far too far off for thought or any prayer.
What ails us with thee, who art wind and air?
What ails us gazing where all seen is hollow?
Yet with some fancy, yet with some desire,
Dreams pursue death as winds a flying fire,
Our dreams pursue our dead and do not find.
Still, and more swift than they, the thin flame flies,
The low light fails us in elusive skies,
Still the foil'd earnest ear is deaf, and blind
Are still the eluded eyes.
Not thee, O never thee, in all time's changes,
Not thee, but this the sound of thy sad soul,
The shadow of thy swift spirit, this shut scroll
I lay my hand on, and not death estranges
My spirit from communion of thy song--
These memories and these melodies that throng
Veil'd porches of a Muse funereal--
These I salute, these touch, these clasp and fold
As though a hand were in my hand to hold,
Or through mine ears a mourning musical
Of many mourners roll'd.
I among these, I also, in such station
As when the pyre was charr'd, and piled the sods.
And offering to the dead made, and their gods,
The old mourners had, standing to make libation,
I stand, and to the Gods and to the dead
Do reverence without prayer or praise, and shed
Offering to these unknown, the gods of gloom,
And what of honey and spice my seed-lands bear,
And what I may of fruits in this chill'd air,
And lay, Orestes-like, across the tomb
A curl of sever'd hair.
But by no hand nor any treason stricken,
Not like the low-lying head of Him, the King,
The flame that made of Troy a ruinous thing,
Thou liest and on this dust no tears could quicken.
There fall no tears like theirs that all men hear
Fall tear by sweet imperishable tear
Down the opening leaves of holy poets' pages.
Thee not Orestes, not Electra mourns;
But bending us-ward with memorial urns
The most high Muses that fulfil all ages
Weep, and our God's heart yearns.
For, sparing of his sacred strength, not often
Among us darkling here the lord of light
Makes manifest his music and his might
In hearts that open and in lips that soften
With the soft flame and heat of songs that shine.
Thy lips indeed he touch'd with bitter wine,
And nourish'd them indeed with bitter bread;
Yet surely from his hand thy soul's food came,
The fire that scarr'd thy spirit at his flame
Was lighted, and thine hungering heart he fed
Who feeds our hearts with fame.
Therefore he too now at thy soul's sunsetting,
God of all suns and songs, he too bends down
To mix his laurel with thy cypress crown,
And save thy dust from blame and from forgetting.
Therefore he too, seeing all thou wert and art,
Compassionate, with sad and sacred heart,
Mourns thee of many his children the last dead,
And hollows with strange tears and alien sighs
Thine unmelodious mouth and sunless eyes,
And over thine irrevocable head
Sheds light from the under skies.
And one weeps with him in the ways Lethean,
And stains with tears her changing bosom chill;
That obscure Venus of the hollow hill,
That thing transform'd which was the Cytherean,
With lips that lost their Grecian laugh divine
Long since, and face no more call'd Erycine--
A ghost, a bitter and luxurious god.
Thee also with fair flesh and singing spell
Did she, a sad and second prey, compel
Into the footless places once more trod,
And shadows hot from hell.
And now no sacred staff shall break in blossom,
No choral salutation lure to light
A spirit sick with perfume and sweet night
And love's tired eyes and hands and barren bosom.
There is no help for these things; none to mend,
And none to mar; not all our songs, O friend,
Will make death clear or make life durable.
Howbeit with rose and ivy and wild vine
And with wild notes about this dust of thine
At least I fill the place where white dreams dwell
And wreathe an unseen shrine.
Sleep; and if life was bitter to thee, pardon,
If sweet, give thanks; thou hast no more to live;
And to give thanks is good, and to forgive.
Out of the mystic and the mournful garden
Where all day through thine hands in barren braid
Wove the sick flowers of secrecy and shade,
Green buds of sorrow and sin, and remnants gray,
Sweet-smelling, pale with poison, sanguine-hearted,
Passions that sprang from sleep and thoughts that started,
Shall death not bring us all as thee one day
Among the days departed?
For thee, O now a silent soul, my brother,
Take at my hands this garland, and farewell.
Thin is the leaf, and chill the wintry smell,
And chill the solemn earth, a fatal mother,
With sadder than the Niobean womb,
And in the hollow of her breasts a tomb.
Content thee, howsoe'er, whose days are done;
There lies not any troublous thing before,
Nor sight nor sound to war against thee more,
For whom all winds are quiet as the sun,
All waters as the shore."

Awakens an old memory, and say,
'Your strength, that is so lofty and fierce and kind,
It might call up a new age, calling to mind
The queens that were imagined long ago,

Through the long years of youth, and who would have thought
It all, and more than it all, would come to naught,
And that dear words meant nothing?'  But enough,
For when we have blamed the wind we can blame love;
Or, if there needs be more, be nothing said
That would be harsh for children that have strayed."
3233,Emotion,MemoryPoemsMemoryPoembyBobBlackwell,"It was a happening,
a moment in time,
some fifty years ago.
I remember
the pull on my shirt,
a plaintive voice
a cry for help,
the revulsion
that I felt.
For standing there,
Iraqi girl,
age close to seven,
dress torn,
sandals broken,
cupped hands
outstretched;
no nose,
no cheek,
no right eye.
staring out
instead
a gap,
a void,
a fly trapped
festering hole.
Horror struck,
I search,
I find a coin,
a silver one,
to give,
to push
into her hand.
I think
girl with only half a face,
please go away,
please leave my view,
seeing you
I ache, I pain,
I hurt,
for you do offend
my sight.
She had run,
had scurried off,
was quickly gone.
Now when I close my eyes."

Like dates of wars and deaths of kings,
And yet recalls the very hour--
'T was noon by yonder village tower,
And on the last blue noon in May--
The wind came briskly up this way,
Crisping the brook beside the road;
Then, pausing here, set down its load
Of pine-scents, and shook listlessly
Two petals from that wild-rose tree."
3235,Emotion,MemoryPoemsElegyToTheMemoryOfRichardBoyleEsqPoembyMaryDarbyRobinson,"NEAR yon bleak mountain's dizzy height,
That hangs o'er AVON's silent wave;
By the pale Crescent's glimm'ring light,
I sought LORENZO's lonely grave.
O'er the long grass the silv'ry dew,
Soft Twilight's tears spontaneous shone;
And the dank bough of baneful yew
Supply'd the place of sculptured stone.
Oft, as my trembling steps drew near,
The aëry voice of FANCY gave
The plaint of GENIUS to mine ear,
That, lingering, murmur'd on his grave.
""Cold is that heart, where honour glow'd,
And Friendship's flame sublimely shone,
And clos'd that eye where Pity flow'd,
For ev'ry suff'ring but HIS OWN.
""That form where youth and grace conspir'd,
To captivate admiring eyes,
No more belov'd, no more admir'd,
A torpid mass neglected lies.
""Mute is the music of that tongue,
Once tuneful as the voice of love,
When ORPHEUS, by his magic song,
Taught trees, and flinty rocks to move.
""Oft shall the pensive MUSE be found,
Sprinkling with flow'rs his mould'ring clay;
While soft-eyed SORROW wand'ring round,
Shall pluck intruding weeds away.""
Sad victim of the sordid mind,
That doom'd THEE to an early grave;
Ne'er shall HER breast that pity find,
Which thy forgiveness nobly gave!
Thou, who, when SORROW'S icy hand
Forbad the healthsome pulse to flow,
Obedient to HER stern command,
With meek submission bow'd thee low!
And when thy faded cheek proclaim'd
The thorn that rankled in thy breast,
Thy steady soul that pride maintain'd,
Which marks the godlike mind distress'd!
Nor was thy mental strength subdu'd,
When HOPE's last ling'ring shadows fled,
Unchang'd, thy dauntless spirit view'd
The dreary confines of the dead!
And when thy penetrating mind,
Life's thorny maze presum'd to scan,
In ev'ry path condemn'd to find
""The low ingratitude of man.""
Indignant would'st thou turn away,
And smiling raise thy languid eye,
And oft thy feeble voice would say,
""TO ME 'TIS HAPPINESS TO DIE.""
And tho' thy FRIEND, I with skilful art,
To heal thy woes, each balm apply'd;
Tho' the fine feelings of his heart,
Nor cost nor studious care deny'd!
He saw the fatal hour draw near,
He saw THEE fading to the grave;
He gave his last kind gift, A TEAR,
And mourn'd the worth he could not save.
Nor could the ruthless breath of FATE
Snatch from thy grave the tender sigh;
Nor a relentless monster's hate
Impede thy passage to the sky.
And tho' no kindred tears were shed,
No tribute to thy memory giv'n;
Sublime in death, thy spirit fled,
To seek its best reward IN HEAVEN!"
3236,Emotion,MemoryPoemsARectorsMemoryPoembyRudyardKipling,"St. Andrews, 1923
The, Gods that are wiser than Learning
But kinder than Life have made sure
No mortal may boast in the morning
That even will find him secure.
With naught for fresh faith or new trial,
With little unsoiled or unsold,
Can the shadow go back on the dial,
Or a new world be given for the old?
But he knows not that time shall awaken,
As he knows not what tide shall lay bare,
The heart of a man to be taken --
Taken and changed unaware.
He shall see as he tenders his vows
The far, guarded City arise --
The power of the North 'twixt Her brows --
The steel of the North in Her eyes;
The sheer hosts of Heaven above --
The grey warlock Ocean beside;
And shall feel the full centuries move
To Her purpose and pride.
Though a stranger shall he understand,
As though it were old in his blood,
The lives that caught fire 'neath Her hand --
The fires that were tamed to Her mood.
And the roar of the wind shall refashion,
And the wind-driven torches recall,
The passing of Time and the passion
Of Youth over all!
And, by virtue of magic unspoken
(What need She should utter Her power?)
The frost at his heart shall be broken
And his spirit be changed in that hour --
Changed and renewed in that hour!"
3237,Emotion,MemoryPoemsInMemoryOfAlfredPollexfenPoembyWilliamButlerYeats,"FIVE-AND-TWENTY years have gone
Since old William pollexfen
Laid his strong bones down in death
By his wife Elizabeth
In the grey stone tomb he made.
And after twenty years they laid
In that tomb by him and her
His son George, the astrologer;
And Masons drove from miles away
To scatter the Acacia spray
Upon a melancholy man
Who had ended where his breath began.
Many a son and daughter lies
Far from the customary skies,
The Mall and Eades's grammar school,
In London or in Liverpool;
But where is laid the sailor John
That so many lands had known,
Quiet lands or unquiet seas
Where the Indians trade or Japanese?
He never found his rest ashore,
Moping for one voyage more.
Where have they laid the sailor John?
And yesterday the youngest son,
A humorous, unambitious man,
Was buried near the astrologer,
Yesterday in the tenth year
Since he who had been contented long.
A nobody in a great throng,
Decided he would journey home,
Now that his fiftieth year had come,
And 'Mr.  Alfred' be again
Upon the lips of common men
Who carried in their memory
His childhood and his family.
At all these death-beds women heard
A visionary white sea-bird
Lamenting that a man should die;
And with that cry I have raised my cry."
3238,Emotion,MemoryPoemsTheFirstOfMayAMemoryPoembyVictorJamesDaley,"THE WATERS make a music low:
The river reeds
Are trembling to the tunes of long ago—
Dead days and deeds
Become alive again, as on
I float, and float,
Through shadows of the golden summers gone
And springs remote.
Above my head the trees bloom out
In white and red
Great blossoms, that make glad the air about;
And old suns shed
Their rays athwart them. Ah, the light
Is bright and fair!
No suns that shine upon me now are bright
As those suns were.
And, gazing down into the stream,
I see a face,
As sweet as buds that blossom in a dream,
Ere sorrows chase
Fair dreams from men, and send in lieu
Sad thoughts. A wreath
Of blue-bells binds the head—a bluer blue
The eyes beneath.
This is my little Annie’s face;
My child-sweetheart
Whom long ago I lost in that dark place
Where all lives part.
Beside me still I see her stand,
Who is no more.
She walked with me through childhood, hand in hand,
But at the door
Of youth departed from me. Fain
Was I that day
To go with her. Ah, sweetheart, come again
This First of May!"

the way you sauntered up to my door.
How you would always look at the mailbox
like you'd never been here before.
The visions of you surround me.
Your memory is still everywhere.
I wish you could talk with me now.
It's hard to accept you are there.
I see you smoking your cigarrettes
''No filters! ''... just as you like.
I go to the places you've travelled.
I see you where we loved to hike.
It's strange when I think of ''forever''
and know that you'll never return.
I wish things were not left unanswered.
I'm sure there is so much you've learned.
Your journey must have had a purpose.
You suffured like no one I've known.
I look forward to our reuniting.
Will it suprise you to see how I've grown?

Had ripened thy just soul to dwell with God,
Meekly thou didst resign this earthly load
Of death, called life, which us from life doth sever.
Thy works, and alms, and all thy good endeavour,
Stayed not behind, nor in the grave were trod;
But, as Faith pointed with her golden rod,
Followed thee up to joy and bliss for ever.
Love led them on; and Faith, who knew them best
Thy handmaids, clad them o’er with purple beams
And azure wings, that up they flew so drest,
And speak the truth of thee on glorious themes
Before the Judge; who henceforth bid thee rest,
And drink thy fill of pure immortal streams."

Murderer or mistress of my heart.
I know I'd rather meet the blow
Of my most unrelenting foe
Than live---as now I live---to be
Slain twenty times a day by thee.
Yet, when I would command thee hence,
Thou mockest at the vain pretence,
Murmuring in mine ear a song
Once loved, alas! forgotten long;
And on my brow I feel a kiss
That I would rather die than miss."
3243,Emotion,MemoryPoemsMonodyToTheMemoryOfChattertonPoembyMaryDarbyRobinson,"Chill penury repress'd his noble rage,
And froze the genial current of his soul.
GRAY.
IF GRIEF can deprecate the wrath of Heaven,
Or human frailty hope to be forgiven !
Ere now thy sainted spirit bends its way
To the bland regions of celestial day;
Ere now, thy soul, immers'd in purest air
Smiles at the triumphs of supreme Despair;
Or bath'd in seas of endless bliss, disdains
The vengeful memory of mortal pains;
Yet shall the MUSE a fond memorial give
To shield thy name, and bid thy GENIUS live.
Too proud for pity, and too poor for praise,
No voice to cherish, and no hand to raise;
Torn, stung, and sated, with this ""mortal coil,""
This weary, anxious scene of fruitless toil;
Not all the graces that to youth belong,
Nor all the energies of sacred song;
Nor all that FANCY, all that GENIUS gave,
Could snatch thy wounded spirit from the grave.
Hard was thy lot, from every comfort torn;
In POVERTY'S cold arms condemn'd to mourn;
To live by mental toil, e'en when the brain
Could scarce its trembling faculties sustain;
To mark the dreary minutes slowly creep:
Each day to labour, and each night to weep;
'Till the last murmur of thy frantic soul,
In proud concealment from its mansion stole,
While ENVY springing from her lurid cave,
Snatch'd the young LAURELS from thy rugged grave.
So the pale primrose, sweetest bud of May,
Scarce wakes to beauty, ere it feels decay;
While baleful weeds their hidden n poisons pour,
Choke the green sod, and wither every flow'r.
Immur'd in shades, from busy scenes remov'd;
No sound to solace,­but the verse he lov'd:
No soothing numbers harmoniz'd his ear;
No feeling bosom gave his griefs a tear;
Obscurely born­no gen'rous friend he found
To lead his trembling steps o'er classic ground.
No patron fill'd his heart with flatt'ring hope,
No tutor'd lesson gave his genius scope;
Yet, while poetic ardour nerv'd each thought,
And REASON sanction'd what AMBITION taught;
He soar'd beyond the narrow spells that bind
The slow perceptions of the vulgar mind;
The fire once kindled by the breath of FAME,
Her restless pinions fann'd the glitt'ring flame;
Warm'd by its rays, he thought each vision just;
For conscious VIRTUE seldom feels DISTRUST.
Frail are the charms delusive FANCY shows,
And short the bliss her fickle smile bestows;
Yet the bright prospect pleas'd his dazzled view,
Each HOPE seem'd ripened, and each PHANTOM true;
Fill'd with delight, his unsuspecting mind
Weigh'd not the grov'ling treach'ries of mankind;
For while a niggard boon his Savants supply'd,
And NATURE'S claims subdued the voice of PRIDE:
His timid talents own'd a borrow'd name,
And gain'd by FICTION what was due to FAME.
With secret labour, and with taste refin'd,
This son of mis'ry form'd his infant mind !
When op'ning Reason's earliest scenes began,
The dawn of childhood mark'd the future man !
He scorn'd the puerile sports of vulgar boys,
His little heart aspir'd to nobler joys;
Creative Fancy wing'd his few short hours,
While soothing Hope adorn'd his path with flow'rs,
Yet FAME'S recording hand no trophy gave,
Save the sad TEAR­to decorate his grave.
Yet in this dark, mysterious scene of woe,
Conviction's flame shall shed a radiant glow;
His infant MUSE shall bind with nerves of fire
The sacrilegious hand that stabs its sire.
Methinks, I hear his wand'ring shade complain,
While mournful ECHO lingers on the strain;
Thro' the lone aisle his restless spirit calls,
His phantom glides along the minster's § walls;
Where many an hour his devious footsteps trod,
Ere Fate resign'd him TO HIS PITYING GOD.
Yet, shall the MUSE to gentlest sorrow prone
Adopt his cause, and make his griefs her own;
Ne'er shall her CHATTERTON's neglected name,
Fade in inglorious dreams of doubtful fame;
Shall he, whose pen immortal GENIUS gave,
Sleep unlamented in an unknown grave?
No, ­the fond MUSE shall spurn the base neglect,
The verse she cherish'd she shall still protect.
And if unpitied pangs the mind can move,
Or graceful numbers warm the heart to love;
If the fine raptures of poetic fire
Delight to vibrate on the trembling lyre;
If sorrow claims the kind embalming tear,
Or worth oppress'd, excites a pang sincere?
Some kindred soul shall pour the song divine,
And with the cypress bough the laurel twine,
Whose weeping leaves the wint'ry blast shall wave
In mournful murmurs o'er thy unbless'd grave.
And tho' no lofty VASE or sculptur'd BUST
Bends o'er the sod that hides thy sacred dust;
Tho' no long line of ancestry betrays
The PRIDE of RELATIVES, or POMP of PRAISE.
Tho' o'er thy name a blushing nation rears
OBLIVION'S wing­ to hide REFLECTION'S tears!
Still shall thy verse in dazzling lustre live,
And claim a brighter wreath THAN WEALTH CAN GIVE."

Ah damn, I let the moment slip away
Rackin' my brain~~goin' insane
Contemplatin' on how to let ya know
How it always goes
Losin' my nerve~~feels like I just got served!
Keep tellin' myself  I gotta find a way
Not gonna be afraid like yesterday
I'm so into you~~gotta find out if you are too
Heavy feelin' in my chest
Tryin' to represent my very best
You lookin' at me like I'm broken glass
Hands clampsed together behind your back,
Puzzled, somehow I gotta show you some real class...
Jaw drops, would ya look at that six pack!
I wanna aproach you, let you know how I feel
We had a thing once before
You haven't said one thing since I sat down on the shore
Here comes ya friend, askin' to rub me down
So I don't peel
You must not have approved
One simple glare and off he went with a snare
Finally you decide to take over
Impressing others of your ability to make me laugh
People always said we made a perfect pair!
The muzic plays our song
Instantly we both turn and look at each other
Smiles across our faces~~you offer me your hand
Brushing the sand off, you quickly took notice
My bikini was a thong!
Things went well, for the rest of the evenin'
Tomorrow I'll be back to rackin' my brain
Just gonna chill for now
Take it for what it is~~if it's still aloud.

3245,Emotion,MemoryPoemsMemoryPoembyWilliamWordsworth,"A pen--to register; a key--
That winds through secret wards
Are well assigned to Memory
By allegoric Bards.
As aptly, also, might be given
A Pencil to her hand;
That, softening objects, sometimes even
Outstrips the heart's demand;
That smooths foregone distress, the lines
Of lingering care subdues,
Long-vanished happiness refines,
And clothes in brighter hues;
Yet, like a tool of Fancy, works
Those Spectres to dilate
That startle Conscience, as she lurks
Within her lonely seat.
Oh! that our lives, which flee so fast,
In purity were such,
That not an image of the past
Should fear that pencil's touch!
Retirement then might hourly look
Upon a soothing scene,
Age steal to his allotted nook
Contented and serene;
With heart as calm as lakes that sleep,
In frosty moonlight glistening;
Or mountain rivers, where they creep
Along a channel smooth and deep,
To their own far-off murmurs listening."

What mix'd emotions with the Thought arise!
Beloved friend, four years have pass'd away
Since thou wert snatch'd forever from our eyes.--
The day, commemorative of my birth
Bestowing Life and Light and Hope on me,
Brings back the hour which was thy last on Earth.
Oh! bitter pang of torturing Memory!--
Angelic Woman! past my power to praise
In Language meet, thy Talents, Temper, mind.
Thy solid Worth, they captivating Grace!--
Thou friend and ornament of Humankind!--
At Johnson's death by Hamilton t'was said,
'Seek we a substitute--Ah! vain the plan,
No second best remains to Johnson dead--
None can remind us even of the Man.'
So we of thee--unequall'd in thy race
Unequall'd thou, as he the first of Men.
Vainly we wearch around the vacant place,
We ne'er may look upon thy like again.
Come then fond Fancy, thou indulgant Power,--
--Hope is desponding, chill, severe to thee!--
Bless thou, this little portion of an hour,
Let me behold her as she used to be.
I see her here, with all her smiles benign,
Her looks of eager Love, her accents sweet.
That voice and Countenance almost divine!--
Expression, Harmony, alike complete.--
I listen--'tis not sound alone--'tis sense,
'Tis Genius, Taste and Tenderness of Soul.
'Tis genuine warmth of heart without pretence
And purity of Mind that crowns the whole.
She speaks; 'tis Eloquence--that grace of Tongue
So rare, so lovely!--Never misapplied
By her to palliate Vice, or deck a Wrong,
She speaks and reasons but on Virtue's side.
Her's is the Engergy of Soul sincere.
Her Christian Spirit ignorant to feign,
Seeks but to comfort, heal, enlighten, chear,
Confer a pleasure, or prevent a pain.--
Can ought enhance such Goodness?--Yes, to me,
Her partial favour from my earliest years
Consummates all.--Ah! Give me yet to see
Her smile of Love.--the Vision diappears.
'Tis past and gone--We meet no more below.
Short is the Cheat of Fancy o'er the Tomb.
Oh! might I hope to equal Bliss to go!
To meet thee Angel! in thy future home!--
Fain would I feel an union in thy fate,
Fain would I seek to draw an Omen fair
From this connection in our Earthly date.
Indulge the harmless weakness--Reason, spare.--"

When the last lonely bar has closed
And you’re drunk with sadness
And not with booze;
Look me up with your running panty hose
And your smoky dress;
Look me up with your tearful eyes
And your weary voice;
Look me up with your abandoned children
Dangling from your heart
Like a nearly broken necklace;
Look me up like a lost sinner
With unutterable crimes to confess
To her fallible priest and fragile God;
Look me up, dear angel,
Before you’re gone forever,
A fading memory beneath forgetful sod."
3248,Emotion,MemoryPoemsInMemoryOfJaneFraserPoembyGeoffreyHill,"When snow like sheep lay in the fold
And wind went begging at each door,
And the far hills were blue with cold,
And a cloud shroud lay on the moor,
She kept the siege.  And every day
We watched her brooding over death
Like a strong bird above its prey.
The room filled with the kettle's breath.
Damp curtains glued against the pane
Sealed time away.  Her body froze
As if to freeze us all, and chain
Creation to a stunned repose.
She died before the world could stir.
In March the ice unloosed the brook
And water ruffled the sun's hair.
Dead cones upon the alder shook."
3249,Emotion,MemoryPoemsBoyAndHisKiteSpecialMemoryPoembyBJAyers,"High in the sky, like a bird in the air,
One lonely kite, soars peacefully there,
A child on the ground, with a string in  hand,
Pulling ever so slightly, to keep it from sand,
With every slight dip, he tugs the kite,
To keep it flying, to keep it in flight,
High in the sky, he watches with care,
A kite in the air, he tries to keep it there,
A dad watches silently, with pride in his face,
As his little boy tries, to keep it in place,
A memory in making, a time to share,
A time in life, with love and care."
3250,Emotion,MemoryPoemsElegyToTheMemoryOfAnUnfortunateLadyPoembyAlexanderPope,"What beck'ning ghost, along the moon-light shade
Invites my steps, and points to yonder glade?
'Tis she!--but why that bleeding bosom gor'd,
Why dimly gleams the visionary sword?
Oh ever beauteous, ever friendly! tell,
Is it, in heav'n, a crime to love too well?
To bear too tender, or too firm a heart,
To act a lover's or a Roman's part?
Is there no bright reversion in the sky,
For those who greatly think, or bravely die?
Why bade ye else, ye pow'rs! her soul aspire
Above the vulgar flight of low desire?
Ambition first sprung from your blest abodes;
The glorious fault of angels and of gods;
Thence to their images on earth it flows,
And in the breasts of kings and heroes glows.
Most souls, 'tis true, but peep out once an age,
Dull sullen pris'ners in the body's cage:
Dim lights of life, that burn a length of years
Useless, unseen, as lamps in sepulchres;
Like eastern kings a lazy state they keep,
And close confin'd to their own palace, sleep.
From these perhaps (ere nature bade her die)
Fate snatch'd her early to the pitying sky.
As into air the purer spirits flow,
And sep'rate from their kindred dregs below;
So flew the soul to its congenial place,
Nor left one virtue to redeem her race.
But thou, false guardian of a charge too good,
Thou, mean deserter of thy brother's blood!
See on these ruby lips the trembling breath,
These cheeks now fading at the blast of death:
Cold is that breast which warm'd the world before,
And those love-darting eyes must roll no more.
Thus, if eternal justice rules the ball,
Thus shall your wives, and thus your children fall;
On all the line a sudden vengeance waits,
And frequent hearses shall besiege your gates.
There passengers shall stand, and pointing say,
(While the long fun'rals blacken all the way)
""Lo these were they, whose souls the furies steel'd,
And curs'd with hearts unknowing how to yield.
Thus unlamented pass the proud away,
The gaze of fools, and pageant of a day!
So perish all, whose breast ne'er learn'd to glow
For others' good, or melt at others' woe.""
What can atone (oh ever-injur'd shade!)
Thy fate unpitied, and thy rites unpaid?
No friend's complaint, no kind domestic tear
Pleas'd thy pale ghost, or grac'd thy mournful bier.
By foreign hands thy dying eyes were clos'd,
By foreign hands thy decent limbs compos'd,
By foreign hands thy humble grave adorn'd,
By strangers honour'd, and by strangers mourn'd!
What though no friends in sable weeds appear,
Grieve for an hour, perhaps, then mourn a year,
And bear about the mockery of woe
To midnight dances, and the public show?
What though no weeping loves thy ashes grace,
Nor polish'd marble emulate thy face?
What though no sacred earth allow thee room,
Nor hallow'd dirge be mutter'd o'er thy tomb?
Yet shall thy grave with rising flow'rs be drest,
And the green turf lie lightly on thy breast:
There shall the morn her earliest tears bestow,
There the first roses of the year shall blow;
While angels with their silver wings o'ershade
The ground, now sacred by thy reliques made.
So peaceful rests, without a stone, a name,
What once had beauty, titles, wealth, and fame.
How lov'd, how honour'd once, avails thee not,
To whom related, or by whom begot;
A heap of dust alone remains of thee,
'Tis all thou art, and all the proud shall be!
Poets themselves must fall, like those they sung,
Deaf the prais'd ear, and mute the tuneful tongue.
Ev'n he, whose soul now melts in mournful lays,
Shall shortly want the gen'rous tear he pays;
Then from his closing eyes thy form shall part,
And the last pang shall tear thee from his heart,
Life's idle business at one gasp be o'er,
The Muse forgot, and thou belov'd no more!"
3251,Emotion,MemoryPoemsAMemoryFromASonnetSequencePoembyRupertBrooke,"Somewhile before the dawn I rose, and stept
Softly along the dim way to your room,
And found you sleeping in the quiet gloom,
And holiness about you as you slept.
I knelt there; till your waking fingers crept
About my head, and held it.  I had rest
Unhoped this side of Heaven, beneath your breast.
I knelt a long time, still; nor even wept.
It was great wrong you did me; and for gain
Of that poor moment's kindliness, and ease,
And sleepy mother-comfort!
Child, you know
How easily love leaps out to dreams like these,
Who has seen them true.  And love that's wakened so
Takes all too long to lay asleep again."

In Casterbridge there stood a noble pile,
Wrought with pilaster, bay, and balustrade
In tactful times when shrewd Eliza swayed. -
On burgher, squire, and clown
It smiled the long street down for near a mile

But evil days beset that domicile;
The stately beauties of its roof and wall
Passed into sordid hands. Condemned to fall
Were cornice, quoin, and cove,
And all that art had wove in antique style.
III
Among the hired dismantlers entered there
One till the moment of his task untold.
When charged therewith he gazed, and answered bold:
""Be needy I or no,
I will not help lay low a house so fair!
IV
""Hunger is hard. But since the terms be such -
No wage, or labour stained with the disgrace
Of wrecking what our age cannot replace
To save its tasteless soul -
I'll do without your dole. Life is not much!
V
Dismissed with sneers he backed his tools and went,
And wandered workless; for it seemed unwise
To close with one who dared to criticize
And carp on points of taste:
To work where they were placed rude men were meant.
VI
Years whiled. He aged, sank, sickened, and was not:
And it was said, ""A man intractable
And curst is gone."" None sighed to hear his knell,
None sought his churchyard-place;
His name, his rugged face, were soon forgot.
VII
The stones of that fair hall lie far and wide,
And but a few recall its ancient mould;
Yet when I pass the spot I long to hold
As truth what fancy saith:
""His protest lives where deathless things abide!"""

the first few primroses she did not pick
tucked neat into the hedgerow
a wisp of sheepwool
caught on wire she did not touch
a dewdro p which the sun caught as she passed
rabbits who lifted softbrush ears
paused then hopped away and yet not fast
a slight breeze which did not touch the primroses
which blew the wisp of sheepwool a little for a moment
which trembled the dewdro p into colours
and yet it stayed on the grass stalk

3254,Emotion,MemoryPoemsInMemoryOfMyFeelingsPoembyFrankOHara,"My quietness has a man in it, he is transparent
and he carries me quietly, like a gondola, through the streets.
He has several likenesses, like stars and years, like numerals.
My quietness has a number of naked selves,
so many pistols I have borrowed to protect myselves
from creatures who too readily recognize my weapons
and have murder in their heart!
though in winter
they are warm as roses, in the desert
taste of chilled anisette.
At times, withdrawn,
I rise into the cool skies
and gaze on at the imponderable world with the simple identification
of my colleagues, the mountains. Manfred climbs to my nape,
speaks, but I do not hear him,
I'm too blue.
An elephant takes up his trumpet,
money flutters from the windows of cries, silk stretching its mirror
across shoulder blades. A gun is ""fired.""
One of me rushes
to window #13 and one of me raises his whip and one of me
flutters up from the center of the track amidst the pink flamingoes,
and underneath their hooves as they round the last turn my lips
are scarred and brown, brushed by tails, masked in dirt's lust,
definition, open mouths gasping for the cries of the bettors for the lungs
of earth.
So many of my transparencies could not resist the race!
Terror in earth, dried mushrooms, pink feathers, tickets,
a flaking moon drifting across the muddied teeth,
the imperceptible moan of covered breathing,
love of the serpent!
I am underneath its leaves as the hunter crackles and pants
and bursts, as the barrage balloon drifts behind a cloud
and animal death whips out its flashlight,
whistling
and slipping the glove off the trigger hand. The serpent's eyes
redden at sight of those thorny fingernails, he is so smooth!
My transparent selves
flail about like vipers in a pail, writhing and hissing
without panic, with a certain justice of response
and presently the aquiline serpent comes to resemble the Medusa."
3255,Emotion,MemoryPoemsMemoryOfYouPoembyJacquelineDougherty,"You are but a memory to my dear heart
that dwindles as each day passes me by.
My heart yearns for you, but you're not there,
only your memory is, and that hurts even more.
The tears are all too real and they follow the pain
my heart feels when it misses you so.
Memory upon memory floods the gates
and soon I begin to drown in them.
Each better than the last but all so sweet and real.
The memory is real but its fading too fast
its uncontrolable, and its evaporating
like dew drops in the sun.
I try to gather them up quickly, place them in a jar, but
the time is quicker than I, and it speeds up the sun's steal.
O I wish you could be here and not just your memory
because you are by far better than the thought of the past.
As each sunset brings forth a new day,
I think about the memory, and the pain it brings
is too immense but the tears are even bigger.
You are but a memory that is quickly fading
and only you can fix that my dear.
Though my heart hurts so much from the pain
only you can save me.
Like each sunset brings forth a new time,
this sunset will bring you to me.
And love back into the mourning heart"
3256,Emotion,MemoryPoemsToHerMemoryPoembyBhartenduSecond,"You are abruptly lost
Like a kite
flying on raw threads
Your loss is my memory
Your face hangs in the sky
Against the wind
Oh! your memory!
my words are far away from
The metaphors that could hold on
you to the landscape of my mind
Your memory sings against language
or sounds
You defy my familiar tools
And dimly expose an unknown
familiar to ages
and ages of our species"
3257,Emotion,MemoryPoemsBeatlesMemoryPoembyLindaOri,"Listening to ' Beatles Sunday Morning'
Reminds me of a foggy London memory.......
Spent nine hours on a plane from JFK
Some years ago back in the 60's
Attempting to land in London
Fog so thick no way to get down
So up we go and circle, circle, circle 'round...
Still no visibility, so back we go
To Shannon, landing there to refuel;
Wanting to throw up - so queezy!
Sat on that plane for 2 hours eating Rolaids
But I do recall the beauty of the country
As we soared high above and circled 'round......
I vowed to return one day
When my stomach could handle the trip;
So here we go again, onward to England
This time the fog has lifted
And there on top of the buildings
Throngs of people are waving and shouting....
Certainly not for this American plane,
But for the Beatles  - on a plane
Coming down somewhere behind us!
What a thrill!  And here we are in London
Just in time for dinner -' on the house'
Thanks to the delay in reaching our destination.
That's the closest I'll ever get to 'royalty'
But still a memory I'll treasure forever."
3258,Emotion,MemoryPoemsLossOfMemoryPoembyhariharanssundaram,"I thank the loss of my memory
Of those days when I had not a friend
I am thankful to the memory
Of those great moments when we are together
I thank the loss of my memory
Of those seconds prior to your reasonableness
I am thankful to the memory
Of the great dimple when you smile
I thank the loss of my memory
Prior to the reduction of your anger
I am thankful to the memory
Of those great sharing moments of your success
I thank the loss of my memory
For the reasons of our arguments
I am thankful to the greatest
Moments of my life with you."
3259,Emotion,MemoryPoemsIfTheMemoryPoembyRobertWylie,"If the memory I have of you
Were small enough to fill a thimble
I would fill a thimble,
And keep it in my sight.
But, since the memory I have of you
Is battle-size, I will fill a field
Big enough for armies, and
Listen to their noise.
Should the memory I have of you
Diminish, then, through all my years,
I will find, again, the thimble,
And keep it filled within my sight."
3260,Emotion,MemoryPoemsInMemoryOfWalterSavageLandorPoembyAlgernonCharlesSwinburne,"Back to the flower-town, side by side,
The bright months bring,
New-born, the bridegroom and the bride,
Freedom and spring.
The sweet land laughs from sea to sea,
Filled full of sun;
All things come back to her, being free;
All things but one.
In many a tender wheaten plot
Flowers that were dead
Live, and old suns revive; but not
That holier head.
By this white wandering waste of sea,
Far north, I hear
One face shall never turn to me
As once this year:
Shall never smile and turn and rest
On mine as there,
Nor one most sacred hand be prest
Upon my hair.
I came as one whose thoughts half linger,
Half run before;
The youngest to the oldest singer
That England bore.
I found him whom I shall not find
Till all grief end,
In holiest age our mightiest mind,
Father and friend.
But thou, if anything endure,
If hope there be,
O spirit that man's life left pure,
Man's death set free,
Not with disdain of days that were
Look earthward now;
Let dreams revive the reverend hair,
The imperial brow;
Come back in sleep, for in the life
Where thou art not
We find none like thee. Time and strife
And the world's lot
Move thee no more; but love at least
And reverent heart
May move thee, royal and released,
Soul, as thou art.
And thou, his Florence, to thy trust
Receive and keep,
Keep safe his dedicated dust,
His sacred sleep.
So shall thy lovers, come from far,
Mix with thy name
As morning-star with evening-star
His faultless fame."

And charm'd attention with resistless pow'r;
Whose wond'rous art, whose fascinating mien,
Gave glowing rapture to the short-liv'd hour!
Accept the mournful verse, the ling'ring sigh,
The tear that faithful Mem'ry stays to shed;
The SACRED TEAR, that from Reflection's eye,
Drops on the ashes of the sainted dead.
Lov'd by the grave, and courted by the young,
In social comforts eminently blest;
All hearts rever'd the precepts of thy tongue,
And Envy's self thy eloquence confess'd.
Who could like thee the soul's wild tumults paint,
Or wake the torpid ear with lenient art?
Touch the nice sense with pity's dulcet plaint,
Or soothe the sorrows of the breaking heart?
Who can forget thy penetrating eye,
The sweet bewitching smile, th' empassion'd look?
The clear deep whisper, the persuasive sigh,
The feeling tear that Nature's language spoke?
Rich in each treasure bounteous Heaven could lend,
For private worth distinguish'd and approv'd,
The pride of WISDOM,­VIRTUE's darling friend,
By MANSFIELD honor'd­and by CAMDEN lov'd!
The courtier's cringe, the flatt'rer's abject smile,
The subtle arts of well-dissembled praise,
Thy soul abhorr'd;­above the gloss of guile,
Truth lead thy steps, and Friendship crown'd thy days.
Oft in thy HAMPTON's dark embow'ring shade
The POET's hand shall sweep the trembling string;
While the proud tribute §to thy mem'ry paid,
The voice of GENIUS on the gale shall fling.
Yes, SHERIDAN! thy soft melodious verse
Still vibrates on a nation's polish'd ear;
Fondly it hover'd o'er the sable hearse,
Hush'd the loud plaint, and triumph'd in a tear.
In life united by congenial minds,
Dear to the MUSE, to sacred friendship true;
Around her darling's urn a wreath SHE binds,
A deathless wreath­immortaliz'd by YOU!
But say, dear shade, is kindred mem'ry flown?
Has widow'd love at length forgot to weep?
That no kind verse, or monumental stone,
Marks the lone spot where thy cold relics sleep!
Dear to a nation, grateful to thy muse,
That nation's tears upon thy grave shall flow,
For who the gentle tribute can refuse,
Which thy fine feeling gave to fancied woe?
Thou who, by many an anxious toilsome hour,
Reap'd the bright harvest of luxuriant Fame,
Who snatch'd from dark oblivion's barb'rous pow'r
The radiant glories of a SHAKSPERE's name!
Rembrance oft shall paint the mournful scene
Where the slow fun'ral spread its length'ning gloom,
Where the deep murmur, and dejected mien,
In artless sorrow linger'd round thy tomb.
And tho' no laurel'd bust, or labour'd line,
Shall bid the passing stranger stay to weep;
Thy SHAKSPERE's hand shall point the hallow'd shrine,
And Britain's genius with thy ashes sleep.
Then rest in peace, O ever sacred shade!
Your kindred souls exulting FAME shall join;
And the same wreath thy hand for SHAKSPERE made,
Gemm'd with her tears about THY GRAVE SHALL TWINE."

My friends cheering, the black line
'We will be home before Christmas'.
I joined because friends had joined.
Friends always.
Haunted by the poster saying,
'What did you do in the war dad'?
I survived the training, a young, well read
healthy man.
Sworn at and cursed by the old Boer war
Survivors.
Putting on the loose, ill fitting uniform
Like sheep. Docile sheep.
Trying to believe what I was doing was right.
When the fighting began, I was in a trench.
Stinking mud of bodies, faeces and rats.
The noise of the guns, thundering and scarring me.
So there is no sleep and I cannot think.
Whistles blowing, shouts of the officers
Making me mount the ladder and see
No-mans land for the first time.
Is this what I am fighting for?
Before I could think anymore,
A punch in the chest drops me to the
Dirt, soldiers treading on me.
I cannot breathe and I want to sleep.
I am far from home."

Is gone the gentlest of the gentle sex!

Unequal to the conflict soon was lost.
Severe her sufferings! much, alas, she bore,
Then sunk beneath the storm & rose no more.
But when th' Archangel's awful trump shall sound
And vibrate life thro all the deep profound
Her renovated vessel will be seen,
Transcendant floating on the silver stream!
All beauteous to behold! serene she glides
Borne on by mildest & propitious tides;
While fanning zephyrs fill her snow white sails
And aid her passage with the friendliest gales
Till safe within the destin'd port of bliss
She furls her sails and moors in endless peace."

Don't make me wait forever baby
Or until my days of prime are done

There's a flame that you ignite
It never dies though winds may blow"

3269,Emotion,MemoryPoemsOdeInMemoryOfTheAmericanVolunteersFallenForFrancePoembyAlanSeeger,"(To have been read before the statue of Lafayette and Washington in Paris, on Decoration Day, May 30, 1916).
I
Ay, it is fitting on this holiday,
Commemorative of our soldier dead,
When -- with sweet flowers of our New England May
Hiding the lichened stones by fifty years made gray --
Their graves in every town are garlanded,
That pious tribute should be given too
To our intrepid few
Obscurely fallen here beyond the seas.
Those to preserve their country's greatness died;
But by the death of these
Something that we can look upon with pride
Has been achieved, nor wholly unreplied
Can sneerers triumph in the charge they make
That from a war where Freedom was at stake
America withheld and, daunted, stood aside.
II
Be they remembered here with each reviving spring,
Not only that in May, when life is loveliest,
Around Neuville-Saint-Vaast and the disputed crest
Of Vimy, they, superb, unfaltering,
In that fine onslaught that no fire could halt,
Parted impetuous to their first assault;
But that they brought fresh hearts and springlike too
To that high mission, and 'tis meet to strew
With twigs of lilac and spring's earliest rose
The cenotaph of those
Who in the cause that history most endears
Fell in the sunny morn and flower of their young years.
III
et sought they neither recompense nor praise,
Nor to be mentioned in another breath
Than their blue coated comrades whose great days
It was their pride to share -- ay, share even to the death!
Nay, rather, France, to you they rendered thanks
(Seeing they came for honor, not for gain),
Who, opening to them your glorious ranks,
Gave them that grand occasion to excel,
That chance to live the life most free from stain
And that rare privilege of dying well.
IV
O friends! I know not since that war began
From which no people nobly stands aloof
If in all moments we have given proof
Of virtues that were thought American.
I know not if in all things done and said
All has been well and good,
Or if each one of us can hold his head
As proudly as he should,
Or, from the pattern of those mighty dead
Whose shades our country venerates to-day,
If we've not somewhat fallen and somewhat gone astray.
But you to whom our land's good name is dear,
If there be any here
Who wonder if her manhood be decreased,
Relaxed its sinews and its blood less red
Than that at Shiloh and Antietam shed,
Be proud of these, have joy in this at least,
And cry: ""Now heaven be praised
That in that hour that most imperilled her,
Menaced her liberty who foremost raised
Europe's bright flag of freedom, some there were
Who, not unmindful of the antique debt,
Came back the generous path of Lafayette;
And when of a most formidable foe
She checked each onset, arduous to stem --
Foiled and frustrated them --
On those red fields where blow with furious blow
Was countered, whether the gigantic fray
Rolled by the Meuse or at the Bois Sabot,
Accents of ours were in the fierce melee;
And on those furthest rims of hallowed ground
Where the forlorn, the gallant charge expires,
When the slain bugler has long ceased to sound,
And on the tangled wires
The last wild rally staggers, crumbles, stops,
Withered beneath the shrapnel's iron showers: --
Now heaven be thanked, we gave a few brave drops;
Now heaven be thanked, a few brave drops were ours.""
V
There, holding still, in frozen steadfastness,
Their bayonets toward the beckoning frontiers,
They lie -- our comrades -- lie among their peers,
Clad in the glory of fallen warriors,
Grim clusters under thorny trellises,
Dry, furthest foam upon disastrous shores,
Leaves that made last year beautiful, still strewn
Even as they fell, unchanged, beneath the changing moon;
And earth in her divine indifference
Rolls on, and many paltry things and mean
Prate to be heard and caper to be seen.
But they are silent, calm; their eloquence
Is that incomparable attitude;
No human presences their witness are,
But summer clouds and sunset crimson-hued,
And showers and night winds and the northern star.
Nay, even our salutations seem profane,
Opposed to their Elysian quietude;
Our salutations calling from afar,
From our ignobler plane
And undistinction of our lesser parts:
Hail, brothers, and farewell; you are twice blest, brave hearts.
Double your glory is who perished thus,
For you have died for France and vindicated us."
3270,Emotion,MemoryPoemsMemoryPoembyZoraBerniceMayCross,"Late, late last night, when the whole world slept,
Along to the garden of dreams I crept.
And I pulled the bell of an old, old house
Where the moon dipped down like a little white mouse.
I tapped the door and I tossed my head:
""Are you in, little girl? Are you in?"" I said.
And while I waited and shook with cold
Through the door tripped me---just eight years old.
I looked so sweet with my pigtails down,
Tied up with a ribbon of dusky brown,
With a dimpled chin full of childish charme,
And my old black dolly asleep in my arms.
I sat me down when I saw myself,
And I told little tales of a moonland elf.
I laughed and sang as I used to do
When the world was ruled by Little Boy Blue.
Then I danced with a toss and a twirl
And said: ""Now have you been a good, good girl?
Have you had much spanking since you were Me?
And does it feel fine to be twenty-three?""
I kissed me then, and I said farewell,
For I've earned more spanks than I dared to tell,
And Eight must never see Twenty-three
As she peeps through the door of Memory."
3271,Emotion,MemoryPoemsOdeToTheMemoryOfBurnsPoembyThomasCampbell,"Soul of the Poet ! wheresoe'er,
Reclaimed from earth, thy genius plume
Her wings of immortality ;
Suspend thy harp in happier sphere,
And with thine influence illume
The gladness of our jubilee.
And fly like fiends from secret spell,
Discord and Strife, at Burn's name,
Exorcised by his memory ;
For he was chief of bards that swell
The heart with songs of social flame,
And high delicious revelry.
And Love's own strain to him was given,
To warble all its ecstacies
With Pythian words unsought, unwilled,—
Love, the surviving gift of Heaven
The choicest sweet of Paradise,
In life's else bitter cup distilled.
Who that has melted o'er his lay
To Mary's soul, in Heaven above ,
But pictured sees, in fancy strong,
The landscape and the livelong day
That smiled upon their mutual love ?
Who that has felt forgets the song ?
Nor skilled one flame alone to fan:
His country's high-souled peasantry
What patriot-pride he taught !—how much
To weigh the inborn worth of man !
And rustic life and poverty
Grow beautiful beneath his touch.
Him, in his clay-built cot, the Muse
Entranced, and showed him all the forms,
Of fairy-light and wizard gloom,
(That only gifted Poet views,)
The Genii of the floods and storms,
And martial shades from Glory's tomb.
On Bannock-field what thoughts arouse
The swain whom Burns's song inspires !
Beat not his Caledonian veins,
As o'er the heroic turf he ploughs,
With all the spirit of his sires,
And all their scorn of death and chains ?
And see the Scottish exile, tanned
By many a far and foreign clime,
Bend o'er his home-born verse, and weep
In memory of his native land,
With love that scorns the lapse of time,
And ties that stretch beyond the deep.
Encamped by Indian rivers wild,
The soldier resting on his arms,
In Burns's carol sweet recalls
The scenes that blessed him when a child,
And glows and gladdens at the charms
Of Scotia's woods and waterfalls.
O deem not, 'midst this worldly strife,
An idle art the Poet brings:
Let high Philosophy control,
And sages calm the stream of life,
'T is he refines its fountain-springs,
The nobler passions of the soul.
It is the muse that consecrates
The native banner of the brave,
Unfurling, at the trumpet's breath,
Rose, thistle, harp ; 't is she elates
To sweep the field or ride the wave,
A sunburst in the storm of death.
And thou, young hero , when thy pall
Is crossed with mournful sword and plume,
When public grief begins to fade,
And only tears of kindred fall,
Who but the bard shall dress thy tomb,
And greet with fame thy gallant shade ?
Such was the soldier—Burns, forgive
That sorrows of mine own intrude
In strains to thy great memory due.
In verse like thine, oh ! Could he live,
The friend I mourned—the brave—the good
Edward that died at Waterloo !*
Farewell, high chief of Scottish song !
That couldst alternately impart
Wisdom and rapture in thy page,
And brand each vice with satire strong,
Whose lines are mottoes of the heart?
Whose truths electrify the sage.
Farewell ! and ne'er may Envy dare
To wring one baleful poison drop
From the crushed laurels of thy bust ;
But while the lark sings sweet in air,
Still may the grateful pilgrim stop,
To bless the spot that holds thy dust."
3272,Emotion,MemoryPoemsYourMemoryKeepsCallingMeBackPoembyDavidHarris,"Years ago, we came to the end of the line,
both went our separate ways,
but your memory keeps calling me back.
Calling to me from a distant shore,
back to your arms once more.
I try to resist and carry on,
but your memory keeps calling me back,
like some overplayed song.
I have a different life now,
the life we had is now over and gone.
Traces of our love they still remain,
but I cannot go back, I don’t feel the same.
Each day it gets harder fighting the urge,
for your memory keeps calling me back,
saying with you is where I belong.

And tune your merry notes;
And, while upon the wind
Your music floats,
I'll pore upon the stream
Where sighing lovers dream,
And fish for fancies as they pass
Within the watery glass.
I'll drink of the clear stream,
And hear the linnet's song;
And there I'll lie and dream
The day along:
And, when night comes, I'll go
To places fit for woe,

9 years old ignorant toward
the feeling that paralyzes my heart,
creates a lump in my throat-
close my eyes and cover my ears

I can pretend I don't actually know

I sit criss-crossed in the dirt-
a crooked wind bends the grains,
shivers the skeleton inside my skin.

I call to her,
is she able to hear me
above the sounds of her dying hymns.
then I come to her,
as if it were a dream-
she looks far beyond her years,
though I know her well;
I know of her light,
I know of her faith,
but I know not of her death.
too young to understand,
an indifference-
she walks to meet God
in her garden, and I follow
(too closely)
she says she needs time
alone to write her thoughts-
and I wonder if I'm in them."
3275,Emotion,MemoryPoemsToMemoryPoembyMathildeBlind,"Oh in this dearth and winter of the soul,
When even Hope, still wont to soar and sing,
Droopeth, a starveling bird whose downy wing
Stiffens ere dead through the dank drift it fall--
Yea, ere Hope perish utterly, I call
On thee, fond Memory, that thou haste and bring
One leaf, one blossom from that far-off spring
When love's auroral light lay over all.
Bring but one pansy: haply so the thrill
Of poignant yearning for those glad dead years
May, like the gusty south, breathe o'er the chill
Of frozen grief, dissolving it in tears,
Till numb Hope, stirred by that warm dropping rain,
Will deem, perchance, Love's springtide come again."
3276,Emotion,MemoryPoemsAPoemSacredToTheMemoryOfSirIsaacNewtonPoembyJamesThomson,"Shall the great soul of Newton quit this earth,
To mingle with his stars; and every muse,
Astonish'd into silence, shun the weight
Of honours due to his illustrious name?
But what can man?--Even now the sons of light,
In strains high-warbled to seraphic lyre,
Hail his arrival on the coast of bliss.
Yet am not I deterr'd, though high the theme,
And sung to harps of angels, for with you,
Ethereal flames! ambitious, I aspire
In Nature's general symphony to join.
And what new wonders can ye show your guest!
Who, while on this dim spot, where mortals toil
Clouded in dust, from motion's simple laws,
Could trace the secret hand of Providence,
Wide-working through this universal frame.
Have ye not listen'd while he bound the suns
And planets to their spheres! th' unequal task
Of humankind till then. Oft had they roll'd
O'er erring man the year, and oft disgrac'd
The pride of schools, before their course was known
Full in its causes and effects to him,
All-piercing sage! who sat not down and dream'd
Romantic schemes, defended by the din
Of specious words, and tyranny of names;
But, bidding his amazing mind attend,
And with heroic patience years on years
Deep-searching, saw at last the system dawn,
And shine, of all his race, on him alone.
What were his raptures then! how pure! how strong!
And what the triumphs of old Greece and Rome,
By his diminish'd, but the pride of boys
In some small fray victorious! when instead
Of shatter'd parcels of this earth usurp'd
By violence unmanly, and sore deeds
Of cruelty and blood, Nature herself
Stood all subdu'd by him, and open laid
Her every latent glory to his view.
All intellectual eye, our solar-round
First gazing through, he by the blended power
Of gravitation and projection saw
The whole in silent harmony revolve.
From unassisted vision hid, the moons
To cheer remoter planets numerous pour'd,
By him in all their mingled tracts were seen.
He also fix'd the wandering Queen of Night,
Whether she wanes into a scanty orb,
Or, waxing broad, with her pale shadowy light,
In a soft deluge overflows the sky.
Her every motion clear-discerning, he
Adjusted to the mutual main, and taught
Why now the mighty mass of water swells
Resistless, heaving on the broken rocks,
And the full river turning; till again
The tide revertive, unattracted, leaves
A yellow waste of idle sands behind.
Then breaking hence, he took his ardent flight
Through the blue infinite; and every star,
Which the clear concave of a winter's night
Pours on the eye, or astronomic tube,
Far-stretching, snatches from the dark abyss,
Or such as farther in successive skies
To fancy shine alone, at his approach
Blaz'd into suns, the living centre each
Of an harmonious system: all combin'd,
And rul'd unerring by that single power,
Which draws the stone projected to the ground.
O unprofuse magnificence divine!
O wisdom truly perfect! thus to call
From a few causes such a scheme of things,
Effects so various, beautiful, and great,
An universe complete! and O belov'd
Of Heaven! whose well-purg'd penetrative eye,
The mystic veil transpiercing, inly scann'd
The rising, moving, wide-establish'd frame.
He, first of men, with awful wing pursu'd
The comet through the long elliptic curve,
As round innumerous worlds he wound his way,
Till, to the forehead of our evening sky
Return'd, the blazing wonder glares anew,
And o'er the trembling nations shakes dismay.
The heavens are all his own, from the wild rule
Of whirling vortices and circling spheres
To their first great simplicity restor'd.
The schools astonish'd stood; but found it vain
To keep at odds with demonstration strong,
And, unawaken'd, dream beneath the blaze
Of truth. At once their pleasing visions fled,
With the gay shadows of the morning mix'd,
When Newton rose, our philosophic sun!
Th' aërial flow of sound was known to him,
From whence it first in wavy circles breaks,
Till the touch'd organ takes the message in.
Nor could the darting beam of speed immense
Escape his swift pursuit and measuring eye.
Ev'n Light itself, which every thing displays,
Shone undiscover'd, till his brighter mind
Untwisted all the shining robe of day;
And, from the whitening undistinguish'd blaze,
Collecting every ray into his kind,
To the charm'd eye educ'd the gorgeous train
Of parent colours. First the flaming red
Sprung vivid forth; the tawny orange next;
And next delicious yellow; by whose side
Fell the kind beams of all-refreshing green.
Then the pure blue, that swells autumnal skies
Ethereal played; and then, of sadder hue,
Emerg'd the deepen'd indigo, as when
The heavy-skirted evening droops with frost;
While the last gleamings of refracted light
Died in the fainting violet away.
These, when the clouds distil the rosy shower,
Shine out distinct adown the wat'ry bow;
While o'er our heads the dewy vision bends
Delightful, melting on the fields beneath.
Myriads of mingling dyes from these result,
And myriads still remain--infinite source
Of beauty, ever flushing, ever new.
Did ever poet image aught so fair,
Dreaming in whisp'ring groves by the hoarse brook?
Or prophet, to whose rapture heaven descends?
Ev'n now the setting sun and shifting clouds,
Seen, Greenwich, from thy lovely heights, declare
How just, how beauteous the refractive law.
The noiseless tide of time, all bearing down
To vast eternity's unbounded sea,
Where the green islands of the happy shine,
He stemm'd alone; and, to the source (involv'd
Deep in primeval gloom) ascending, rais'd
His lights at equal distances, to guide
Historian wilder'd on his darksome way.
But who can number up his labours? who
His high discoveries sing? When but a few
Of the deep-studying race can stretch their minds
To what he knew--in fancy's lighter thought
How shall the muse then grasp the mighty theme?
What wonder thence that his devotion swell'd
Responsive to his knowledge? For could he,
Whose piercing mental eye diffusive saw
The finish'd university of things
In all its order, magnitude, and parts,
Forbear incessant to adore that Power
Who fills, sustains, and actuates the whole?
Say, ye who best can tell, ye happy few,
Who saw him in the softest lights of life,
All unwithheld, indulging to his friends
The vast unborrow'd treasures of his mind,
oh, speak the wondrous man! how mild, how calr
How greatly humble, how divinely good,
How firm establish'd on eternal truth;
Fervent in doing well, with every nerve
Still pressing on, forgetful of the past,
And panting for perfection; far above
Those little cares and visionary joys
That so perplex the fond impassion'd heart
Of ever-cheated, ever-trusting man.
This, Conduitt, from thy rural hours we hope;
As through the pleasing shade where nature pours
Her every sweet in studious ease you walk,
The social passions smiling at thy heart
That glows with all the recollected sage.
And you, ye hopeless gloomy-minded tribe,
You who, unconscious of those nobler flights
That reach impatient at immortal life,
Against the prime endearing privilege
Of being dare contend,--say, can a soul
Of such extensive, deep, tremendous powers,
Enlarging still, be but a finer breath
Of spirits dancing through their tubes awhile,
And then for ever lost in vacant air?
But hark! methinks I hear a warning voice,
Solemn as when some awful change is come,
Sound through the world--"" 'Tis done!--the measure's full;
And I resign my charge.""--Ye mouldering stones
That build the towering pyramid, the proud
Triumphal arch, the monument effac'd
By ruthless ruin, and whate'er supports
The worship'd name of hoar antiquity--
Down to the dust! What grandeur can ye boast
While Newton lifts his column to the skies,
Beyond the waste of time. Let no weak drop
Be shed for him. The virgin in her bloom
Cut off, the joyous youth, and darling child--
These are the tombs that claim the tender tear
And elegiac song. But Newton calls
For other notes of gratulation high,
That now he wanders through those endless worlds
He here so well descried, and wondering talks,
And hymns their Author with his glad compeers.
O Britain's boast! whether with angels thou
Sittest in dread discourse, or fellow-blest,
Who joy to see the honour of their kind;
Or whether, mounted on cherubic wing,
Thy swift career is with the whirling orbs,
Comparing things with things, in rapture lost,
And grateful adoration for that light
So plenteous ray'd into thy mind below
From Light Himself; oh, look with pity down
On humankind, a frail erroneous race!
Exalt the spirit of a downward world!
O'er thy dejected country chief preside,
And be her Genius call'd! her studies raise,
Correct her manners, and inspire her youth;
For, though deprav'd and sunk, she brought thee forth,
And glories in thy name! she points thee out
To all her sons, and bids them eye thy star:
While, in expectance of the second life,
When time shall be no more, thy sacred dust
Sleeps with her kings, and dignifies the scene."
3277,Emotion,MemoryPoemsMemoryOfSunPoembyAnnaAkhmatova,"Memory of sun seeps from the heart.
Grass grows yellower.
Faintly if at all the early snowflakes
Hover, hover.
Water becoming ice is slowing in
The narrow channels.
Nothing at all will happen here again,
Will ever happen.
Against the sky the willow spreads a fan
The silk's torn off.
Maybe it's better I did not become
Your wife.
Memory of sun seeps from the heart.
What is it? -- Dark?
Perhaps! Winter will have occupied us
In the night."
3278,Emotion,MemoryPoemsInLovingMemoryPoembyDavidHarris,"A long time ago,1976 to be exact
a friend said I should go along
to a writing class he had joined.
Therefore, I did and met someone,
who was to change my life.
However, I did not know it at the time.
For the first couple of years he was simply my tutor.
However, as the years rolled on,
he became my mentor,
and most of all my friend.
For every year, we knew one another
the friendship grew stronger than before.
Before I met Maurice,
he had published four novels
and I have every one.
He started with A City Called Holy,
next came The Splendour and the Havoc,
and then The World and the Flesh,
and finally Across the Frontier.
He also wrote plays,
produced, directed and acted
in them with his wife Peggy.
When I met him his books
were out of print,
but through the years,
I found them one by one.
After a friendship that lasted
over seventeen years Maurice died.
However just before he passed away,
he told me how his local library
had approached him, wanting to know
if he had any copies of his books,
as they only had one left.
He did not and felt sadly about that.
As he told me, I made a promise to myself.
Not matter how long it took,
or how much it would cost,
his local library would have,
those books of his they did not have.
More than ten years passed from the time of his death,
until I was finally able to fulfil my promise.
I collected through the years
the books the library was missing.
In January 2006, I presented them to his local library.
It was a way of saluting a special friend,
helping keep his name alive.
I did it because of the special gifts,
through the years he gave me.
His friendship, his knowledge and help
with my writing no one had ever given before.
Therefore, any success
that I may ever achieve
can be contributed to him.
A gentleman of words,
my tutor, my mentor,
and lastly a very kind and special friend.
(For the late Maurice Callard)"

basking in the early morning sun,
I felt at peace with the stillness of
a quiet Sunday. Enjoying my surroundings
and the warmth of the day
My senses  peaked by a faint scent
of  fish  filtering through the air.  The feel
of a slight drizzle  touched my nose every
now and then.  I felt the grit of the sand
giving my feet  natures gentle massage
and enjoyed every step of the way.
The sea breeze caressed my naked body,
offering me  a feeling of tranquility.  This is
my place, my special place, alone at
peace with nature, enjoying every moment,
The sand dollars  and starfish were plentiful
and strategically laid along the shoreline,
natures free gifts from the ocean.  An artistic

3281,Emotion,MemoryPoemsLinesToTheMemoryOfRichardBoyleEsqPoembyMaryDarbyRobinson,"""Fate snatch'd him early to the pitying sky.""
- POPE.
IF WORTH, too early to the grave consign'd,
Can claim the pitying tear, or touch the mind ?
If manly sentiments unstain'd by art,
Could waken FRIENDSHIP, or delight the heart ?
Ill-fated youth ! to THEE the MUSE shall pay
The last sad tribute of a mournful lay;
On thy lone grave shall MAY'S soft dews be shed,
And fairest flowrets blossom o'er thy head;
The drooping lily, and the snow-drop pale,
Mingling their fragrant leaves, shall there recline,
While CHERUBS hov'ring on th' ethereal gale,
Shall chaunt a requiem o'er the hallow'd shrine.
And if Reflection's piercing eye should scan
The trivial frailties of imperfect MAN;
If in thy generous heart those passions dwelt,
Which all should own, and all that live have felt;
Yet was thy polish'd mind so pure, so brave,
The young admir'd thee, and the old forgave.
And when stern FATE, with ruthless rancour, press'd
Thy withering graces to her flinty breast;
Bright JUSTICE darted from her bless'd abode,
And bore thy VIRTUES to the throne of GOD;
While cold OBLIVION stealing o'er thy mind,
Each youthful folly to the grave consign'd.
O, if thy purer spirit deigns to know
Each thought that passes in this vale of woe,
Accept the incense of a tender tear,
By PITY wafted on a sigh sincere.
And if the weeping MUSE a wreath could give
To grace thy tomb, and bid thy VIRTUES live;
THEN Wealth should blush the gilded mask to wear,
And Avarice shrink the victim of Despair.
While GENIUS bending o'er thy sable bier,
Should mourn her darling SON with many a tear,
While in her pensive form the world should view
The ONLY PARENT that thy SORROWS knew."
3282,Emotion,MemoryPoemsInMemoryOfMajorRobertGregoryPoembyWilliamButlerYeats,"Now that we're almost settled in our house
I'll name the friends that cannot sup with us
Beside a fire of turf in th' ancient tower,
And having talked to some late hour
Climb up the narrow winding stairs to bed:
Discoverers of forgotten truth
Or mere companions of my youth,
All, all are in my thoughts to-night being dead.
Always we'd have the new friend meet the old
And we are hurt if either friend seem cold,
And there is salt to lengthen out the smart
In the affections of our heart,
And quarrels are blown up upon that head;
But not a friend that I would bring
This night can set us quarrelling,
For all that come into my mind are dead.
Lionel Johnson comes the first to mind,
That loved his learning better than mankind.
Though courteous to the worst; much falling he
Brooded upon sanctity
Till all his Greek and Latin learning seemed
A long blast upon the horn that brought
A little nearer to his thought
A measureless consummation that he dreamed.
And that enquiring man John Synge comes next,
That dying chose the living world for text
And never could have rested in the tomb
But that, long travelling, he had come
Towards nightfall upon certain set apart
In a most desolate stony place,
Towards nightfall upon a race
Passionate and simple like his heart.
And then I think of old George Pollexfen,
In muscular youth well known to Mayo men
For horsemanship at meets or at racecourses,
That could have shown how pure-bred horses
And solid men, for all their passion, live
But as the outrageous stars incline
By opposition, square and trine;
Having grown sluggish and contemplative.
They were my close companions many a year.
A portion of my mind and life, as it were,
And now their breathless faces seem to look
Out of some old picture-book;
I am accustomed to their lack of breath,
But not that my dear friend's dear son,
Our Sidney and our perfect man,
Could share in that discourtesy of death.
For all things the delighted eye now sees
Were loved by him: the old storm-broken trees
That cast their shadows upon road and bridge;
The tower set on the stream's edge;
The ford where drinking cattle make a stir
Nightly, and startled by that sound
The water-hen must change her ground;
He might have been your heartiest welcomer.
When with the Galway foxhounds he would ride
From Castle Taylor to the Roxborough side
Or Esserkelly plain, few kept his pace;
At Mooneen he had leaped a place
So perilous that half the astonished meet
Had shut their eyes; and where was it
He rode a race without a bit?
And yet his mind outran the horses' feet.
We dreamed that a great painter had been born
To cold Clare rock and Galway rock and thorn,
To that stern colour and that delicate line
That are our secret discipline
Wherein the gazing heart doubles her might.
Soldier, scholar, horseman, he,
And yet he had the intensity
To have published all to be a world's delight.
What other could so well have counselled us
In all lovely intricacies of a house
As he that practised or that understood
All work in metal or in wood,
In moulded plaster or in carven stone?
Soldier, scholar, horseman, he,
And all he did done perfectly
As though he had but that one trade alone.
Some burn damp faggots, others may consume
The entire combustible world in one small room
As though dried straw, and if we turn about
The bare chimney is gone black out
Because the work had finished in that flare.
Soldier, scholar, horseman, he,
As 'twere all life's epitome.
What made us dream that he could comb grey hair?
I had thought, seeing how bitter is that wind
That shakes the shutter, to have brought to mind
All those that manhood tried, or childhood loved
Or boyish intellect approved,
With some appropriatc commentary on each;
Until imagination brought
A fitter welcome; but a thought
Of that late death took all my heart for speech."
3283,Emotion,MemoryPoemsTheLibraryOfMemoryPoembyMichaelShepherd,"and then in between remarks,
you fall silent, still, the eyes
not far away but rather,
seeing the faraway right here
and those who know you
or who know the feeling of themselves,
know where you are
how describe that place
where a lifetime’s memories are stored,
clean, precise, waiting, neglected, seemingly forgotten?
is it a castle; a linen closet; a box room, that place in the inner mind?
rather, it seems a library, of the books that life writes
and there comes a moment in between remarks
when the present offers nothing, so it seems;
and your mind leaves the assembled company,
walks into that quiet room, its shelves so carefully arranged
by someone unknown to you, a librarian
who knows you better than you know yourself;
I sit down in that green leather armchair, quietly;
but such the power of the memory of you
the pure essence of the memory of memory itself
that I need not reach to take that well-read book down again
but simply glance towards that place; on that shelf; where it rests;
sit, for a minute of eternity; rediscover myself;
then rise; walk, the back erect, dignified;
the stature taller for the memory of whom I am;
turning the smooth handle of the door as it closes, and
beyond all love, the watching;
freedom that makes the whole world live anew"
3284,Emotion,MemoryPoems152TheCoalTrainChildhoodMemoryPoembyMelvinaGermain,"Waiting patiently a quarter to one,
we heard the whistle blow.
I looked at the others, took deep breaths,
it’s almost time to go.
The train approached, there it was
bigger than life in front of me.
my first time to jump the coal train
and take that coal for free.
We ran with strength and agility,
sprung like jumping jacks.
Took our places a top the car,
zooming along the railroad tracks.
Quickly with all the strength we had,
we threw coal to the ground.
The next task was to bag it up
and sell it in our town.
The coal train came everyday
at a quarter to one,
my first day would be my last,
I put my coal bag down.
Another true story of my childhood in Sydney Nova
Scotia.  Jumping the old coal train to make a few cents,
very little gain indeed.  Looking back once again, I see
the danger of the act, for what was profited certainly
wasn’t worth all that.  A word to the young, “stay out
of harms way, remain honest and true,  the coal train
was not for me and certainly not for you.

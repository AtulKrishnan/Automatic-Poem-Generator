0,Emotion,BeautyPoemsInfiniteBeautyPoembyErnestineNorthover,"Looking over the fields towards the Sun,
Observing that the rain had just begun,
A freshness seemed to permeate the air,
And all that one could do was, stand and stare,
As something magical crept across the skies,
A vision that was reflected in my eyes.
A sight of infinite beauty, there to see,
One of the wonders given to us, for free.
Lovely colours blending, like a dream,
In subtle hues, an arched rainbow supreme.

1,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBeautyImposesPoembyJohnShawNeilson,"Beauty imposes reverence in the Spring,
Grave as the urge within the honeybuds,
It wounds us as we sing.
Beauty is joy that stays not overlong.
Clad in the magic of sincerities,
It rides up in a song.
Beauty imposes chastenings on the heart,
Grave as the birds in last solemnities
Assembling to depart."
2,Emotion,BeautyPoemsItIsNotBeautyIDemandPoembyGeorgeDarley,"It is not Beauty I demand,
A crystal brow, the moon's despair,
Nor the snow's daughter, a white hand,
Nor mermaid's yellow pride of hair.
Tell me not of your starry eyes,
Your lips that seem on roses fed,
Your breasts where Cupid trembling lies,
Nor sleeps for kissing of his bed.
A bloomy pair of vermeil cheeks,
Like Hebe's in her ruddiest hours,
A breath that softer music speaks
Than summer winds a-wooing flowers.
These are but gauds; nay, what are lips?
Coral beneath the ocean-stream,
Whose brink when your adventurer sips
Full oft he perisheth on them.
And what are cheeks but ensigns oft
That wave hot youth to fields of blood?
Did Helen's breast though ne'er so soft,
Do Greece or Ilium any good?
Eyes can with baleful ardor burn,
Poison can breath that erst perfumed,
There's many a white hand holds an urn
With lovers' hearts to dust consumed.
For crystal brows--there's naught within,
They are but empty cells for pride;
He who the Syren's hair would win
Is mostly strangled in the tide.
Give me, instead of beauty's bust,
A tender heart, a loyal mind,
Which with temptation I could trust,
Yet never linked with error find.
One in whose gentle bosom I
Could pour my secret heart of woes.
Like the care-burdened honey-fly
That hides his murmurs in the rose.
My earthly comforter! whose love
So indefeasible might be,
That when my spirit won above
Hers could not stay for sympathy."
3,Emotion,BeautyPoemsTheBeautyWeIgnorePoembyvictoriamartinez,"I am the beauty
The beauty in the summer *the heat*
We ignore it
.
I am the beauty
The beauty in the winter *frozen cold*
We ignore it
.
I am the beauty
The beauty in the fall *dying life*
We ignore it
.
I am the beauty
The beauty in the spring *birth of nature*
We ignore it
.
I am earth
I bare all seasons
And you ignore me"
4,Emotion,BeautyPoemsSonnetLBeautySweetLovePoembySamuelDaniel,"Beauty, sweet love, is like the morning dew
Whose short refresh upon the tender green
Cheers for a time but till the Sun doth show,
And straight 'tis gone as it had never been.
Soon doth it fade that makes the fairest flourish;
Short is the glory of the blushing Rose,
The hue which thou so carefully dost nourish
Yet which at length thou must be forc'd to lose.
When thou surcharg'd with burden of thy years
Shalt bend thy wrinkles homeward to the earth,
When Time hath made a passport for thy fears,
Dated in age the Kalends of our death--
But, ah, no more: this hath been often told,
And women grieve to think they must be old."
5,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBeautyPoembyMathildeBlind,"Even as on some black background full of night
And hollow storm in cloudy disarray,
The forceful brush of some great master may
More brilliantly evoke a higher light;
So beautiful, so delicately white,
So like a very metaphor of May,
Your loveliness on my life's sombre grey
In its perfection stands out doubly bright.
And yet your beauty breeds a strange despair,
And pang of yearning in the helpless heart;
To shield you from time's fraying wear and tear,
That from yourself yourself would wrench apart,
How save you, fairest, but to set you where
Mortality kills death in deathless art?"
6,Emotion,BeautyPoemsYouthAndBeautyPoembyWilliamCarlosWilliams,"I bought a dishmop--
having no daughter--
for they had twisted
fine ribbons of shining copper
about white twine
and made a tousled head
of it, fastened it
upon a turned ash stick
slender at the neck
straight, tall--
when tied upright
on the brass wallbracket
to be a light for me
and naked
as a girl should seem
to her father."
7,Emotion,BeautyPoemsSeekingBeautyPoembyWilliamHenryDavies,"Cold winds can never freeze, nor thunder sour
The cup of cheer that Beauty draws for me
Out of those Azure heavens and this green earth --
I drink and drink, and thirst the more I see.
To see the dewdrops thrill the blades of grass,
Makes my whole body shake; for here's my choice
Of either sun or shade, and both are green --
A Chaffinch laughs in his melodious voice.
The banks are stormed by Speedwell, that blue flower
So like a little heaven with one star out;
I see an amber lake of buttercups,
And Hawthorn foams the hedges round about.
The old Oak tree looks now so green and young,
That even swallows perch awhile and sing:
This is that time of year, so sweet and warm,
When bats wait not for stars ere they take wing.
As long as I love Beauty I am young,
Am young or old as I love more or less;
When Beauty is not heeded or seems stale,
My life's a cheat, let Death end my distress."
8,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBeautyOfLifePoembyUriahHamilton,"I don’t desire to wear a sad face too long
When I know I live in a world of flowers and birds
And that the evening will usher in a sky of scattered stars,
When I know hopeful prayers and songs
Can find you wherever you are.
I’m going to peruse the Psalms and the Dhammapada,
Find encouraging light in the Bhagavad-Gita
Until my breath is one with gratitude
And forever connected to the beauty of life."
9,Emotion,BeautyPoemsTheLivingBeautyPoembyWilliamButlerYeats,"I BADE, because the wick and oil are spent
And frozen are the channels of the blood,
My discontented heart to draw content
From beauty that is cast out of a mould
In bronze, or that in dazzling marble appears,
Appears, but when wc have gone is gone again,
Being more indifferent to our solitude
Than 'twere an apparition.  O heart, we are old;
The living beauty is for younger men:
We cannot pay its rribute of wild tears."
10,Emotion,BeautyPoemsHeTellsOfThePerfectBeautyPoembyWilliamButlerYeats,"O CLOUD-PALE eyelids, dream-dimmed eyes,
The poets labouring all their days
To build a perfect beauty in rhyme
Are overthrown by a woman's gaze
And by the unlabouring brood of the skies:
And therefore my heart will bow, when dew
Is dropping sleep, until God burn time,
Before the unlabouring stars and you."
11,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBeautyMarksTheSpotPoembyEstherLeclerc,"Beauty marks are meant for kissing...
This girl's are found in places pleasing:
On her neck, scented and lissome,
On rounded cheek with smile so teasing.
Another hides where seldom seen
By curious eyes in day or dark;
Yet when she dresses privately
That curve 'bove breast shows beauty's mark.
These sweet signs of Venus's blessing
Are meant for enlightened men of earth
Who ken that women crave much kissing
for their beauty and inner worth."
12,Emotion,BeautyPoemsTheFrailtyAndHurtfulnessOfBeautyPoembyHenryHoward,"Brittle beauty, that nature made so frail,
Whereof the gift is small, and short the season;
Flow'ring today, tomorrow apt to fail,
Tickle treasure, abhorrèd of reason;
Dangerous to deal with, vain, of none avail,
Costly in keeping, past not worth two peason;
Slipper in sliding, as is an eelës tail,
Hard to obtain, once gotten, not geason;
Jewel of jeopardy that peril doth assail,
False and untrue, enticèd oft to treason,
Enemy to youth; that most may I bewail.
Ah, bitter sweet, infecting as the poison,
Thou farest as fruit that with the frost is taken,
Today ready ripe, tomorrow all to-shaken."
13,Emotion,BeautyPoemsToAYoungBeautyPoembyWilliamButlerYeats,"DEAR fellow-artist, why so free
With every sort of company,
With every Jack and Jill?
Choose your companions from the best;
Who draws a bucket with the rest
Soon topples down the hill.
You may, that mirror for a school,
Be passionate, not bountiful
As common beauties may,
Who were not born to keep in trim
With old Ezekiel's cherubim
But those of Beauvarlet.
I know what wages beauty gives,
How hard a life her setvant lives,
Yet praise the winters gone:
There is not a fool can call me friend,
And I may dine at journey's end
With Landor and with Donne."
14,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBeautyMdashBeNotCausedMdashItIsPoembyEmilyDickinson,"516
Beauty—be not caused—It Is—
Chase it, and it ceases—
Chase it not, and it abides—
Overtake the Creases
In the Meadow—when the Wind
Runs his fingers thro' it—
Deity will see to it
That You never do it—"
15,Emotion,BeautyPoemsForBeautyIAmNotAStarPoembyWoodrowWilson,"For beauty I am not a star,
There are others more perfect by far,
But my face I don't mind it,
For I am behind it,
It is those in front that I jar."
16,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBeautySeeBeautyDonTPoembyLonnieHicks,"There was in her face,
in the contours of her
beauty lines
a past smoothing out
which I could see
would match
her older photographs.
The older her
only hinted at
that prior
state.
But I took my time
to look at her
now past 55
to see
in that older landscape
what my eye
sought
in her face at twenty and five..
Could not the face
before me
be seen
on its own terms?
Where is that beauty
line between
beauty and non-beauty?
Is it the tightness of the skin
the twinkle in the eye,
healthy look or
non-healthy look?
What's true is that
my own Western
eye
can only see age;
not nobility;
only TV screen beauty-
not maturity.
But you know
there are a myriad of exceptions;
children don't see age
the same way we do
nor does most of the world.
What is going on here?"
17,Emotion,BeautyPoemsASonnetToHeavenlyBeautyPoembyJoachimduBellay,"If this our little life is but a day
In the Eternal, - if the years in vain
Toil after hours that never come again, -
If everything that hath been must decay,
Why dreamest thou of joys that pass away,
My soul, that my sad body doth restrain?
Why of the moment’s pleasure art thou fain?
Nay, thou hast wings, - nay, seek another stay.
There is the joy whereto each soul aspires,
And there the rest that all the world desires,
And there is love, and peace, and gracious mirth;
And there in the most highest heavens shalt thou
Behold the Very Beauty, whereof now
Thou worshippest the shadow upon earth."
18,Emotion,BeautyPoemsSonnetToTartarATerrierBeautyPoembyThomasLovellBeddoes,"Snowdrop of dogs, with ear of brownest dye,
Like the last orphan leaf of naked tree
Which shudders in black autumn; though by thee,
Of hearing careless and untutored eye,
Not understood articulate speech of men
Nor marked the artificial mind of books,
-The mortal's voice eternized by the pen,-
Yet hast thou thought and language all unknown
To Babel's scholars; oft intensest looks,
Long scrutiny over some dark-veined stone
Dost thou bestow, learning dead mysteries
Of the world's birth-day, oft in eager tone
With quick-tailed fellows bandiest prompt replies,
Solicitudes canine, four-footed amities."
19,Emotion,BeautyPoemsAccidentalBeautyPoembygershonhepner,"The beauty of a ruin may be best
appreciated by a rank outsider,
observing it as uninvited guest,
without the context of a view that’s wider.
Behind the fallen walls there often lie
sad stories of inhabitants who perished
in homes that once abandoned now supply
the ruins travelers long have cherished.
The pleasure coming from the accidental
beauty, burgeoning till it decays,
appeals to anyone who’s sentimental
when seeing signs of others’ judgment days."
20,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBriarRoseSleepingBeautyPoembyAnneSexton,"Consider
a girl who keeps slipping off,
arms limp as old carrots,
into the hypnotist's trance,
into a spirit world
speaking with the gift of tongues.
She is stuck in the time machine,
suddenly two years old sucking her thumb,
as inward as a snail,
learning to talk again.
She's on a voyage.
She is swimming further and further back,
up like a salmon,
struggling into her mother's pocketbook.
Little doll child,
come here to Papa.
Sit on my knee.
I have kisses for the back of your neck.
A penny for your thoughts, Princess.
I will hunt them like an emerald.
Come be my snooky
and I will give you a root.
That kind of voyage,
rank as a honeysuckle.
Once
a king had a christening
for his daughter Briar Rose
and because he had only twelve gold plates
he asked only twelve fairies
to the grand event.
The thirteenth fairy,
her fingers as long and thing as straws,
her eyes burnt by cigarettes,
her uterus an empty teacup,
arrived with an evil gift.
She made this prophecy:
The princess shall prick herself
on a spinning wheel in her fifteenth year
and then fall down dead.
Kaputt!
The court fell silent.
The king looked like Munch's Scream
Fairies' prophecies,
in times like those,
held water.
However the twelfth fairy
had a certain kind of eraser
and thus she mitigated the curse
changing that death
into a hundred-year sleep.
The king ordered every spinning wheel
exterminated and exorcised.
Briar Rose grew to be a goddess
and each night the king
bit the hem of her gown
to keep her safe.
He fastened the moon up
with a safety pin
to give her perpetual light
He forced every male in the court
to scour his tongue with Bab-o
lest they poison the air she dwelt in.
Thus she dwelt in his odor.
Rank as honeysuckle.
On her fifteenth birthday
she pricked her finger
on a charred spinning wheel
and the clocks stopped.
Yes indeed. She went to sleep.
The king and queen went to sleep,
the courtiers, the flies on the wall.
The fire in the hearth grew still
and the roast meat stopped crackling.
The trees turned into metal
and the dog became china.
They all lay in a trance,
each a catatonic
stuck in a time machine.
Even the frogs were zombies.
Only a bunch of briar roses grew
forming a great wall of tacks
around the castle.
Many princes
tried to get through the brambles
for they had heard much of Briar Rose
but they had not scoured their tongues
so they were held by the thorns
and thus were crucified.
In due time
a hundred years passed
and a prince got through.
The briars parted as if for Moses
and the prince found the tableau intact.
He kissed Briar Rose
and she woke up crying:
Daddy! Daddy!
Presto! She's out of prison!
She married the prince
and all went well
except for the fear -
the fear of sleep.
Briar Rose
was an insomniac...
She could not nap
or lie in sleep
without the court chemist
mixing her some knock-out drops
and never in the prince's presence.
If if is to come, she said,
sleep must take me unawares
while I am laughing or dancing
so that I do not know that brutal place
where I lie down with cattle prods,
the hole in my cheek open.
Further, I must not dream
for when I do I see the table set
and a faltering crone at my place,
her eyes burnt by cigarettes
as she eats betrayal like a slice of meat.
I must not sleep
for while I'm asleep I'm ninety
and think I'm dying.
Death rattles in my throat
like a marble.
I wear tubes like earrings.
I lie as still as a bar of iron.
You can stick a needle
through my kneecap and I won't flinch.
I'm all shot up with Novocain.
This trance girl
is yours to do with.
You could lay her in a grave,
an awful package,
and shovel dirt on her face
and she'd never call back: Hello there!
But if you kissed her on the mouth
her eyes would spring open
and she'd call out: Daddy! Daddy!
Presto!
She's out of prison.
There was a theft.
That much I am told.
I was abandoned.
That much I know.
I was forced backward.
I was forced forward.
I was passed hand to hand
like a bowl of fruit.
Each night I am nailed into place
and forget who I am.
Daddy?
That's another kind of prison.
It's not the prince at all,
but my father
drunkeningly bends over my bed,
circling the abyss like a shark,
my father thick upon me
like some sleeping jellyfish.
What voyage is this, little girl?
This coming out of prison?
God help -
this life after death?"
21,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBeautyAndTheBeachPoembyFaithElizabethBrigham,"there is something about the ocean
that brings out the earth-mother in me
it is a place i love to go to write or
to ponder life's mysteries
being out in the ocean with
the waves spraying over me
feels something of a baptism
a cleansing of my soul's debris
the beach has a magnificent beauty
that never ceases to amaze me
and makes me feel one with the earth
in rhythmn and harmony
i realize as i look out to sea
how very small i really must be
in the overall scheme of things
i love the sea for it brings
out the spirituality in me
the feeling of being totally free
like seagulls overhead and
the sand underneath my feet
or the engulfing sun warming me
to get down to the nitty-gritty
the sea is a poet's paradise to me"
22,Emotion,BeautyPoemsTheSongOfPrincessZebUnNissaInPraiseOfHerOwnBeautyPoembySarojiniNaidu,"WHEN from my cheek I lift my veil,
The roses turn with envy pale,
And from their pierced hearts, rich with pain,
Send forth their fragrance like a wail.
Or if perchance one perfumed tress
Be lowered to the wind's caress,
The honeyed hyacinths complain,
And languish in a sweet distress.
And, when I pause, still groves among,
(Such loveliness is mine) a throng
Of nightingales awake and strain
Their souls into a quivering song."
23,Emotion,BeautyPoemsToWhatServesMortalBeautyPoembyGerardManleyHopkins,"To what serves mortal beauty ' —dangerous; does set danc-
ing blood—the O-seal-that-so ' feature, flung prouder form
Than Purcell tune lets tread to? ' See: it does this: keeps warm
Men’s wits to the things that are; ' what good means—where a glance
Master more may than gaze, ' gaze out of countenance.
Those lovely lads once, wet-fresh ' windfalls of war’s storm,
How then should Gregory, a father, ' have gleanèd else from swarm-
ed Rome? But God to a nation ' dealt that day’s dear chance.
To man, that needs would worship ' block or barren stone,
Our law says: Love what are ' love’s worthiest, were all known;
World’s loveliest—men’s selves. Self ' flashes off frame and face.
What do then? how meet beauty? ' Merely meet it; own,
Home at heart, heaven’s sweet gift; ' then leave, let that alone.
Yea, wish that though, wish all, ' God’s better beauty, grace."
24,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBalladeOfMyLadysBeautyPoembyJoyceKilmer,"Squire Adam had two wives, they say,
Two wives had he, for his delight,
He kissed and clypt them all the day
And clypt and kissed them all the night.
Now Eve like ocean foam was white
And Lilith roses dipped in wine,
But though they were a goodly sight
No lady is so fair as mine.
To Venus some folk tribute pay
And Queen of Beauty she is hight,
And Sainte Marie the world doth sway
In cerule napery bedight.
My wonderment these twain invite,
Their comeliness it is divine,
And yet I say in their despite,
No lady is so fair as mine.
Dame Helen caused a grievous fray,
For love of her brave men did fight,
The eyes of her made sages fey
And put their hearts in woeful plight.
To her no rhymes will I indite,
For her no garlands will I twine,
Though she be made of flowers and light
No lady is so fair as mine.
L'Envoi
Prince Eros, Lord of lovely might,
Who on Olympus dost recline,
Do I not tell the truth aright?
No lady is so fair as mine."
25,Emotion,BeautyPoemsJuveniliaAnOdeToNaturalBeautyPoembyAlanSeeger,"There is a power whose inspiration fills
Nature's fair fabric, sun- and star-inwrought,
Like airy dew ere any drop distils,
Like perfume in the laden flower, like aught
Unseen which interfused throughout the whole
Becomes its quickening pulse and principle and soul.
Now when, the drift of old desire renewing,
Warm tides flow northward over valley and field,
When half-forgotten sound and scent are wooing
From their deep-chambered recesses long sealed
Such memories as breathe once more
Of childhood and the happy hues it wore,
Now, with a fervor that has never been
In years gone by, it stirs me to respond, --
Not as a force whose fountains are within
The faculties of the percipient mind,
Subject with them to darkness and decay,
But something absolute, something beyond,
Oft met like tender orbs that seem to peer
From pale horizons, luminous behind
Some fringe of tinted cloud at close of day;
And in this flood of the reviving year,
When to the loiterer by sylvan streams,
Deep in those cares that make Youth loveliest,
Nature in every common aspect seems
To comment on the burden in his breast --
The joys he covets and the dreams he dreams --
One then with all beneath the radiant skies
That laughs with him or sighs,
It courses through the lilac-scented air,
A blessing on the fields, a wonder everywhere.
Spirit of Beauty, whose sweet impulses,
Flung like the rose of dawn across the sea,
Alone can flush the exalted consciousness
With shafts of sensible divinity --
Light of the World, essential loveliness:
Him whom the Muse hath made thy votary
Not from her paths and gentle precepture
Shall vulgar ends engage, nor break the spell
That taught him first to feel thy secret charms
And o'er the earth, obedient to their lure,
Their sweet surprise and endless miracle,
To follow ever with insatiate arms.
On summer afternoons,
When from the blue horizon to the shore,
Casting faint silver pathways like the moon's
Across the Ocean's glassy, mottled floor,
Far clouds uprear their gleaming battlements
Drawn to the crest of some bleak eminence,
When autumn twilight fades on the sere hill
And autumn winds are still;
To watch the East for some emerging sign,
Wintry Capella or the Pleiades
Or that great huntsman with the golden gear;
Ravished in hours like these
Before thy universal shrine
To feel the invoked presence hovering near,
He stands enthusiastic. Star-lit hours
Spent on the roads of wandering solitude
Have set their sober impress on his brow,
And he, with harmonies of wind and wood
And torrent and the tread of mountain showers,
Has mingled many a dedicative vow
That holds him, till thy last delight be known,
Bound in thy service and in thine alone.
I, too, among the visionary throng
Who choose to follow where thy pathway leads,
Have sold my patrimony for a song,
And donned the simple, lowly pilgrim's weeds.
From that first image of beloved walls,
Deep-bowered in umbrage of ancestral trees,
Where earliest thy sweet enchantment falls,
Tingeing a child's fantastic reveries
With radiance so fair it seems to be
Of heavens just lost the lingering evidence
From that first dawn of roseate infancy,
So long beneath thy tender influence
My breast has thrilled. As oft for one brief second
The veil through which those infinite offers beckoned
Has seemed to tremble, letting through
Some swift intolerable view
Of vistas past the sense of mortal seeing,
So oft, as one whose stricken eyes might see
In ferny dells the rustic deity,
I stood, like him, possessed, and all my being,
Flooded an instant with unwonted light,
Quivered with cosmic passion; whether then
On woody pass or glistening mountain-height
I walked in fellowship with winds and clouds,
Whether in cities and the throngs of men,
A curious saunterer through friendly crowds,
Enamored of the glance in passing eyes,
Unuttered salutations, mute replies, --
In every character where light of thine
Has shed on earthly things the hue of things divine
I sought eternal Loveliness, and seeking,
If ever transport crossed my brow bespeaking
Such fire as a prophetic heart might feel
Where simple worship blends in fervent zeal,
It was the faith that only love of thee
Needed in human hearts for Earth to see
Surpassed the vision poets have held dear
Of joy diffused in most communion here;
That whomsoe'er thy visitations warmed,
Lover of thee in all thy rays informed,
Needed no difficulter discipline
To seek his right to happiness within
Than, sensible of Nature's loveliness,
To yield him to the generous impulses
By such a sentiment evoked. The thought,
Bright Spirit, whose illuminings I sought,
That thou unto thy worshipper might be
An all-sufficient law, abode with me,
Importing something more than unsubstantial dreams
To vigils by lone shores and walks by murmuring streams.
Youth's flowers like childhood's fade and are forgot.
Fame twines a tardy crown of yellowing leaves.
How swift were disillusion, were it not
That thou art steadfast where all else deceives!
Solace and Inspiration, Power divine
That by some mystic sympathy of thine,
When least it waits and most hath need of thee,
Can startle the dull spirit suddenly
With grandeur welled from unsuspected springs, --
Long as the light of fulgent evenings,
When from warm showers the pearly shades disband
And sunset opens o'er the humid land,
Shows thy veiled immanence in orient skies, --
Long as pale mist and opalescent dyes
Hung on far isle or vanishing mountain-crest,
Fields of remote enchantment can suggest
So sweet to wander in it matters nought,
They hold no place but in impassioned thought,
Long as one draught from a clear sky may be
A scented luxury;
Be thou my worship, thou my sole desire,
Thy paths my pilgrimage, my sense a lyre
Aeolian for thine every breath to stir;
Oft when her full-blown periods recur,
To see the birth of day's transparent moon
Far from cramped walls may fading afternoon
Find me expectant on some rising lawn;
Often depressed in dewy grass at dawn,
Me, from sweet slumber underneath green boughs,
Ere the stars flee may forest matins rouse,
Afoot when the great sun in amber floods
Pours horizontal through the steaming woods
And windless fumes from early chimneys start
And many a cock-crow cheers the traveller's heart
Eager for aught the coming day afford
In hills untopped and valleys unexplored.
Give me the white road into the world's ends,
Lover of roadside hazard, roadside friends,
Loiterer oft by upland farms to gaze
On ample prospects, lost in glimmering haze
At noon, or where down odorous dales twilit,
Filled with low thundering of the mountain stream,
Over the plain where blue seas border it
The torrid coast-towns gleam.
I have fared too far to turn back now; my breast
Burns with the lust for splendors unrevealed,
Stars of midsummer, clouds out of the west,
Pallid horizons, winds that valley and field
Laden with joy, be ye my refuge still!
What though distress and poverty assail!
Though other voices chide, yours never will.
The grace of a blue sky can never fail.
Powers that my childhood with a spell so sweet,
My youth with visions of such glory nursed,
Ye have beheld, nor ever seen my feet
On any venture set, but 'twas the thirst
For Beauty willed them, yea, whatever be
The faults I wanted wings to rise above;
I am cheered yet to think how steadfastly
I have been loyal to the love of Love!"
26,Emotion,BeautyPoemsTheUnfadingBeautyPoembyThomasCarew,"HE that loves a rosy cheek,
Or a coral lip admires,
Or from star-like eyes doth seek
Fuel to maintain his fires:
As old Time makes these decay,
So his flames must waste away.
But a smooth and steadfast mind,
Gentle thoughts and calm desires,
Hearts with equal love combined,
Kindle never-dying fires.
Where these are not, I despise
Lovely cheeks or lips or eyes."
27,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBeautyPoembyNancyAmato,"Look in my eyes, what do you see,
Beauty of the inner me.
Deep down in your heart, what do you feel,
The beauty of a love that is real.
Touch my hand soft and tender
Is a beauty that makes you surrender.
Listen to my words, what do you hear,
Beauty flowing through the air
Look around you to your left and right
All you'll see is beauty tonight
Kiss my lips, what do you taste
A beauty that would never waste
Run your hands down my body
While looking into my eyes
Listen to my loving words
As my beauty conceals no lies"
28,Emotion,BeautyPoemsTheSleepingBeautyPoembyMathildeBlind,"There was intoxication in the air;
The wind, keen blowing from across the seas,
O'er leagues of new-ploughed land and heathery leas,
Smelt of wild gorse whose gold flamed everywhere.
And undertone of song pulsed far and near,
The soaring larks filled heaven with ecstasies,
And, like a living clock among the trees,
The shouting cuckoo struck the time of year.
For now the Sun had found the earth once more,
And woke the Sleeping Beauty with a kiss;
Who thrilled with light of love in every pore,
Opened her flower-blue eyes, and looked in his.
Then all things felt life fluttering at their core--
The world shook mystical in lambent bliss."
29,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBeautyPoembyElinorMortonWylie,"Say not of beauty she is good,
Or aught but beautiful,
Or sleek to doves' wings of the wood
Her wild wings of a gull.
Call her not wicked; that word's touch
Consumes her like a curse;
But love her not too much, too much,
For that is even worse.
O, she is neither good nor bad,
But innocent and wild!
Enshrine her and she dies, who had
The hard heart of a child."
30,Emotion,BeautyPoemsRackedBeautyPoembyLeoYankevich,"Blest be the dawn, the luminous blue-slate,
the arch transfused by the glorious sun,
and blackbirds chanting hymnals in prickly bushes,
and rooks high over fields coughing up love.
Blest be the winds about the furrowed brow,
and the joyful whispers of dying leaves,
the maples staggered blissfully behind barbed fences
above the tombs of the newly redeemed.
Blest be pain that comes like a stark beggar,
the thorn-tree that has its roots in a star,
the sweet massacred gourds tethered to the rusting gate,
the apples heaped on the agonized floor."
31,Emotion,BeautyPoemsYourBeautyPoembySamMoore,"Your beauty makes my heart skip a beat...
from the anticipation of when we meet,
Your beauty knows no height,
Your beauty is my delight,
Your beauty is in your eyes...
under the southern skies,
Your beauty is in the smile on your lips,
Your beauty is in the curve of your hips,
Your beauty should be in my arms...
until the morning sun warms"
32,Emotion,BeautyPoemsClothedInBeautyPoembyVyacheslavIvanovichIvanov,"As if chiseled, a fruit-laden branch
Hangs in my garden, asleep - so low...
The trees sleep - and dream? - in moonlight;
And the mystery of their life is near, near...
Even if we cannot grasp it,
The mute language is still intelligible:
They use our beauty to express
How we are one amidst rays and spots of light.
And the tremor of any life's creation
Reveals itself in a lovely form;
And the variance of different things is sweetened
By shared beauty. Multiply it!
And the world will be like this unstirring garden,
Where everything heeds a harmonious silence:
Both stem and flower yield to the dear Earth;
Both flower and stem listen to the Moon."
33,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBeautyPoembyEdwardThomas,"WHAT does it mean? Tired, angry, and ill at ease,
No man, woman, or child alive could please
Me now. And yet I almost dare to laugh
Because I sit and frame an epitaph-
'Here lies all that no one loved of him
And that loved no one.' Then in a trice that whim
Has wearied. But, though I am like a river
At fall of evening when it seems that never
Has the sun lighted it or warmed it, while
Cross breezes cut the surface to a file,
This heart, some fraction of me, hapily
Floats through a window even now to a tree
Down in the misting, dim-lit, quiet vale;
Not like a pewit that returns to wail
For something it has lost, but like a dove
That slants unanswering to its home and love.
There I find my rest, and through the dusk air
Flies what yet lives in me. Beauty is there"
34,Emotion,BeautyPoemsWinterBeautyPoembyRachelWeaver,"The bleak of winter leaves me among despair
Thier is only anger and chill in the air
No happiness or laughing
Just grey clouds and bleak white sky
Dont let it all take hold of you for it has a strange beauty within.
A cold beauty
Like a beautiful woman with an empty soul.
In the winter I walk the slushy streets alone
I see the children play
Making angels and happy as if it were May
They seem to love the cold
But oh how this changes when you get old
Winter is still beautiful
In that strange cold way
Everytime it comes around thou
I feel I'm going to fade"
35,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBeautyTimeAndLovePoembySamuelDaniel,"I
FAIR is my Love and cruel as she 's fair;
Her brow-shades frown, although her eyes are sunny.
Her smiles are lightning, though her pride despair,
And her disdains are gall, her favours honey:
A modest maid, deck'd with a blush of honour,
Whose feet do tread green paths of youth and love;
The wonder of all eyes that look upon her,
Sacred on earth, design'd a Saint above.
Chastity and Beauty, which were deadly foes,
Live reconciled friends within her brow;
And had she Pity to conjoin with those,
Then who had heard the plaints I utter now?
For had she not been fair, and thus unkind,
My Muse had slept, and none had known my mind.
II
My spotless love hovers with purest wings,
About the temple of the proudest frame,
Where blaze those lights, fairest of earthly things,
Which clear our clouded world with brightest flame.
My ambitious thoughts, confined in her face,
Affect no honour but what she can give;
My hopes do rest in limits of her grace;
I weigh no comfort unless she relieve.
For she, that can my heart imparadise,
Holds in her fairest hand what dearest is;
My Fortune's wheel 's the circle of her eyes,
Whose rolling grace deign once a turn of bliss.
All my life's sweet consists in her alone;
So much I love the most Unloving one.
III
And yet I cannot reprehend the flight
Or blame th' attempt presuming so to soar;
The mounting venture for a high delight
Did make the honour of the fall the more.
For who gets wealth, that puts not from the shore?
Danger hath honour, great designs their fame;
Glory doth follow, courage goes before;
And though th' event oft answers not the same--
Suffice that high attempts have never shame.
The mean observer, whom base safety keeps,
Lives without honour, dies without a name,
And in eternal darkness ever sleeps.--
And therefore, Delia, 'tis to me no blot
To have attempted, tho' attain'd thee not.
IV
When men shall find thy flow'r, thy glory, pass,
And thou with careful brow, sitting alone,
Received hast this message from thy glass,
That tells the truth and says that All is gone;
Fresh shalt thou see in me the wounds thou mad'st,
Though spent thy flame, in me the heat remaining:
I that have loved thee thus before thou fad'st--
My faith shall wax, when thou art in thy waning.
The world shall find this miracle in me,
That fire can burn when all the matter 's spent:
Then what my faith hath been thyself shalt see,
And that thou wast unkind thou may'st repent.--
Thou may'st repent that thou hast scorn'd my tears,
When Winter snows upon thy sable hairs.
V
Beauty, sweet Love, is like the morning dew,
Whose short refresh upon the tender green
Cheers for a time, but till the sun doth show,
And straight 'tis gone as it had never been.
Soon doth it fade that makes the fairest flourish,
Short is the glory of the blushing rose;
The hue which thou so carefully dost nourish,
Yet which at length thou must be forced to lose.
When thou, surcharged with burthen of thy years,
Shalt bend thy wrinkles homeward to the earth;
And that, in Beauty's Lease expired, appears
The Date of Age, the Calends of our Death--
But ah, no more!--this must not be foretold,
For women grieve to think they must be old.
VI
I must not grieve my Love, whose eyes would read
Lines of delight, whereon her youth might smile;
Flowers have time before they come to seed,
And she is young, and now must sport the while.
And sport, Sweet Maid, in season of these years,
And learn to gather flowers before they wither;
And where the sweetest blossom first appears,
Let Love and Youth conduct thy pleasures thither.
Lighten forth smiles to clear the clouded air,
And calm the tempest which my sighs do raise;
Pity and smiles do best become the fair;
Pity and smiles must only yield thee praise.
Make me to say when all my griefs are gone,
Happy the heart that sighed for such a one!
VII
Let others sing of Knights and Paladines
In aged accents and untimely words,
Paint shadows in imaginary lines,
Which well the reach of their high wit records:
But I must sing of thee, and those fair eyes
Authentic shall my verse in time to come;
When yet th' unborn shall say, Lo, where she lies!
Whose beauty made him speak, that else was dumb!
These are the arcs, the trophies I erect,
That fortify thy name against old age;
And these thy sacred virtues must protect
Against the Dark, and Time's consuming rage.
Though th' error of my youth in them appear,
Suffice, they show I lived, and loved thee dear."
36,Emotion,BeautyPoemsTheImmensePoignantBeautyPoembyUriahHamilton,"Don’t go downward
Into dark sunless thoughts;
Don’t remove tenderness
From your plans
Or from your heart;
Don’t be afraid
Of being fragile and child-like
As you wind your way
Through minefields and snares
Along prickly emotional paths
Of the social landscape.
It is impossible to escape
Loneliness and heartbreak,
But you have to celebrate
The immense, poignant beauty
Of your fears, flaws, and mistakes;
You have to relish every avenue
Your human life does take."

38,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBeautyQueenOrGardenGnomePoembyMaryNagy,"You say that you can picture me sitting in my chair.
What is it that you picture when you look from over there?
Do you envision beauty or an ugly, wrinkled hag?
Does my skin give off a glow or do my wrinkles sag?
It's strange to think you picture someone you've never seen.
I could be short and squatty or maybe tall and lean.
What is the face that's given to represent this poem?
Is it of a beauty queen or just a garden gnome?"
39,Emotion,BeautyPoemsTheDefinitionOfBeautyPoembyRobertHerrick,"Beauty no other thing is, than a beam

40,Emotion,BeautyPoemsCanBeautyRemainBeautyPoembyObinnaKenechukwuEruchie,"Can beauty remain beauty without light?
No beauty survives without light in sight
To endure the pangs sharp of age in flight,
For fair with folly dead plunges at night.
When beauty blooms into beauty divine,
Showered with wisdom married to light to shine,
To border of no ending on the line,
Lifted is beauty's life onto cloud nine.
Life valued more in thought than gold man eyes,
Beats thrones, castles held in esteem that dies.
Vessels with covetousness, wrath, spite, lust, pride,
Greed, sloth do sink into oblivion wide.
Life is nature, who stores light in sublime.
Such beauty saved as truth lives on with time."
41,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBeautyPoembySamPrice,"Most people find beauty in looks,
But I find beauty from the written words in books.
I find beauty in the sun set and sun rise.
I find beauty in three small dog's eyes.
I find beauty in the motion of the sea.
The green fingers of mother nature are very beautiful to me.
I find beauty in my friends laughter.
I find beauty in stories that end happily ever after."
42,Emotion,BeautyPoemsAnHymnInHonourOfBeautyPoembyEdmundSpenser,"AH whither, Love, wilt thou now carry me?
What wontless fury dost thou now inspire
Into my feeble breast, too full of thee?
Whilst seeking to aslake thy raging fire,
Thou in me kindlest much more great desire,
And up aloft above my strength dost raise
The wondrous matter of my fire to praise.
That as I erst in praise of thine own name,
So now in honour of thy mother dear,
An honourable hymn I eke should frame,
And with the brightness of her beauty clear,
The ravish'd hearts of gazeful men might rear
To admiration of that heavenly light,
From whence proceeds such soul-enchanting might.
Thereto do thou, great goddess, queen of beauty,
Mother of love, and of all world's delight,
Without whose sovereign grace and kindly duty
Nothing on earth seems fair to fleshly sight,
Do thou vouchsafe with thy love-kindling light
T' illuminate my dim and dulled eyne,
And beautify this sacred hymn of thine:
That both to thee, to whom I mean it most,
And eke to her, whose fair immortal beam
Hath darted fire into my feeble ghost,
That now it wasted is with woes extreme,
It may so please, that she at length will stream
Some dew of grace into my withered heart,
After long sorrow and consuming smart.
WHAT time this world's great Workmaster did cast
To make all things such as we now behold,
It seems that he before his eyes had plac'd
A goodly pattern, to whose perfect mould
He fashion'd them as comely as he could;
That now so fair and seemly they appear,
As nought may be amended anywhere.
That wondrous pattern, wheresoe'er it be,
Whether in earth laid up in secret store,
Or else in heaven, that no man may it see
With sinful eyes, for fear it to deflore,
Is perfect Beauty, which all men adore;
Whose face and feature doth so much excel
All mortal sense, that none the same may tell.
Thereof as every earthly thing partakes
Or more or less, by influence divine,
So it more fair accordingly it makes,
And the gross matter of this earthly mine,
Which clotheth it, thereafter doth refine,
Doing away the dross which dims the light
Of that fair beam which therein is empight.
For, through infusion of celestial power,
The duller earth it quick'neth with delight,
And lifeful spirits privily doth pour
Through all the parts, that to the looker's sight
They seem to please. That is thy sovereign might,
O Cyprian queen, which flowing from the beam
Of thy bright star, thou into them dost stream.
That is the thing which giveth pleasant grace
To all things fair, that kindleth lively fire,
Light of thy lamp, which, shining in the face,
Thence to the soul darts amorous desire,
And robs the hearts of those which it admire;
Therewith thou pointest thy son's poison'd arrow,
That wounds the life, and wastes the inmost marrow.
How vainly then do idle wits invent,
That beauty is nought else but mixture made
Of colours fair, and goodly temp'rament
Of pure complexions, that shall quickly fade
And pass away, like to a summer's shade;
Or that it is but comely composition
Of parts well measur'd, with meet disposition.
Hath white and red in it such wondrous power,
That it can pierce through th' eyes unto the heart,
And therein stir such rage and restless stour,
As nought but death can stint his dolour's smart?
Or can proportion of the outward part
Move such affection in the inward mind,
That it can rob both sense and reason blind?
Why do not then the blossoms of the field,
Which are array'd with much more orient hue,
And to the sense most dainty odours yield,
Work like impression in the looker's view?
Or why do not fair pictures like power shew,
In which oft-times we nature see of art
Excell'd, in perfect limning every part?
But ah, believe me, there is more than so,
That works such wonders in the minds of men;
I, that have often prov'd, too well it know,
And whoso list the like assays to ken,
Shall find by trial, and confess it then,
That beauty is not, as fond men misdeem,
An outward shew of things, that only seem.
For that same goodly hue of white and red,
With which the cheeks are sprinkled, shall decay,
And those sweet rosy leaves, so fairly spread
Upon the lips, shall fade and fall away
To that they were, even to corrupted clay;
That golden wire, those sparkling stars so bright,
Shall turn to dust; and lose their goodly light.
But that fair lamp, from whose celestial ray
That light proceeds, which kindleth lovers' fire,
Shall never be extinguish'd nor decay;
But when the vital spirits do expire,
Unto her native planet shall retire;
For it is heavenly born and cannot die,
Being a parcel of the purest sky.
For when the soul, the which derived was,
At first, out of that great immortal Spright,
By whom all live to love, whilom did pass
Down from the top of purest heaven's height
To be embodied here, it then took light
And lively spirits from that fairest star,
Which lights the world forth from his fiery car.
Which power retaining still or more or less,
When she in fleshly seed is eft enraced,
Through every part she doth the same impress,
According as the heavens have her graced,
And frames her house, in which she will be placed,
Fit for herself, adorning it with spoil
Of th' heavenly riches which she robb'd erewhile.
Thereof it comes that these fair souls, which have
The most resemblance of that heavenly light,
Frame to themselves most beautiful and brave
Their fleshly bower, most fit for their delight,
And the gross matter by a sovereign might
Tempers so trim, that it may well be seen
A palace fit for such a virgin queen.
So every spirit, as it is most pure,
And hath in it the more of heavenly light,
So it the fairer body doth procure
To habit in, and it more fairly dight
With cheerful grace and amiable sight.
For of the soul the body form doth take:
For soul is form, and doth the body make.
Therefore wherever that thou dost behold
A comely corpse, with beauty fair endued,
Know this for certain, that the same doth hold
A beauteous soul, with fair conditions thewed,
Fit to receive the seed of virtue strewed.
For all that fair is, is by nature good;
That is a sign to know the gentle blood.
Yet oft it falls that many a gentle mind
Dwells in deformed tabernacle drown'd,
Either by chance, against the course of kind,
Or through unaptness in the substance found,
Which it assumed of some stubborn ground,
That will not yield unto her form's direction,
But is deform'd with some foul imperfection.
And oft it falls, (ay me, the more to rue)
That goodly beauty, albe heavenly born,
Is foul abus'd, and that celestial hue,
Which doth the world with her delight adorn,
Made but the bait of sin, and sinners' scorn,
Whilst every one doth seek and sue to have it,
But every one doth seek but to deprave it.
Yet nathëmore is that fair beauty's blame,
But theirs that do abuse it unto ill:
Nothing so good, but that through guilty shame
May be corrupt, and wrested unto will:
Natheless the soul is fair and beauteous still,
However flesh{""e}s fault it filthy make;
For things immortal no corruption take.
But ye fair dames, the world's dear ornaments
And lively images of heaven's light,
Let not your beams with such disparagements
Be dimm'd, and your bright glory dark'ned quite;
But mindful still of your first country's sight,
Do still preserve your first informed grace,
Whose shadow yet shines in your beauteous face.
Loathe that foul blot, that hellish firebrand,
Disloyal lust, fair beauty's foulest blame,
That base affections, which your ears would bland,
Commend to you by love's abused name,
But is indeed the bondslave of defame;
Which will the garland of your glory mar,
And quench the light of your bright shining star.
But gentle Love, that loyal is and true,
Will more illumine your resplendent ray,
And add more brightness to your goodly hue,
From light of his pure fire; which, by like way
Kindled of yours, your likeness doth display;
Like as two mirrors, by oppos'd reflection,
Do both express the face's first impression.
Therefore, to make your beauty more appear,
It you behoves to love, and forth to lay
That heavenly riches which in you ye bear,
That men the more admire their fountain may;
For else what booteth that celestial ray,
If it in darkness be enshrined ever,
That it of loving eyes be viewed never?
But, in your choice of loves, this well advise,
That likest to yourselves ye them select,
The which your forms' first source may sympathize,
And with like beauty's parts be inly deckt;
For, if you loosely love without respect,
It is no love, but a discordant war,
Whose unlike parts amongst themselves do jar.
For love is a celestial harmony
Of likely hearts compos'd of stars' concent,
Which join together in sweet sympathy,
To work each other's joy and true content,
Which they have harbour'd since their first descent
Out of their heavenly bowers, where they did see
And know each other here belov'd to be.
Then wrong it were that any other twain
Should in love's gentle band combined be
But those whom Heaven did at first ordain,
And made out of one mould the more t' agree;
For all that like the beauty which they see,
Straight do not love; for love is not so light
As straight to burn at first beholder's sight.
But they, which love indeed, look otherwise,
With pure regard and spotless true intent,
Drawing out of the object of their eyes
A more refined form, which they present
Unto their mind, void of all blemishment;
Which it reducing to her first perfection,
Beholdeth free from flesh's frail infection.
And then conforming it unto the light,
Which in itself it hath remaining still,
Of that first Sun, yet sparkling in his sight,
Thereof he fashions in his higher skill
An heavenly beauty to his fancy's will;
And it embracing in his mind entire,
The mirror of his own thought doth admire.
Which seeing now so inly fair to be,
As outward it appeareth to the eye,
And with his spirit's proportion to agree,
He thereon fixeth all his fantasy,
And fully setteth his felicity;
Counting it fairer than it is indeed,
And yet indeed her fairness doth exceed.
For lovers' eyes more sharply sighted be
Than other men's, and in dear love's delight
See more than any other eyes can see,
Through mutual receipt of beam{""e}s bright,
Which carry privy message to the spright,
And to their eyes that inmost fair display,
As plain as light discovers dawning day.
Therein they see, through amorous eye-glances,
Armies of loves still flying to and fro,
Which dart at them their little fiery lances;
Whom having wounded, back again they go,
Carrying compassion to their lovely foe;
Who, seeing her fair eyes' so sharp effect,
Cures all their sorrows with one sweet aspect.
In which how many wonders do they rede
To their conceit, that others never see,
Now of her smiles, with which their souls they feed,
Like gods with nectar in their banquets free;
Now of her looks, which like to cordials be;
But when her words' embássade forth she sends,
Lord, how sweet music that unto them lends.
Sometimes upon her forehead they behold
A thousand graces masking in delight;
Sometimes within her eyelids they unfold
Ten thousand sweet belgards, which to their sight
Do seem like twinkling stars in frosty night;
But on her lips, like rosy buds in May,
So many millions of chaste pleasures play.
All those, O Cytherea, and thousands more
Thy handmaids be, which do on thee attend,
To deck thy beauty with their dainties' store,
That may it more to mortal eyes commend,
And make it more admir'd of foe and friend:
That in men's hearts thou may'st thy throne install,
And spread thy lovely kingdom over all.
Then Iö, triumph! O great Beauty's Queen,
Advance the banner of thy conquest high,
That all this world, the which thy vassals bene,
May draw to thee, and with due fealty
Adore the power of thy great majesty,
Singing this hymn in honour of thy name,
Compil'd by me, which thy poor liegeman am.
In lieu whereof grant, O great sovereign,
That she whose conquering beauty doth captive
My trembling heart in her eternal chain,
One drop of grace at length will to me give,
That I her bounden thrall by her may live,
And this same life, which first fro me she reaved,
May owe to her, of whom I it received.
And you, fair Venus' darling, my dear dread,
Fresh flower of grace, great goddess of my life,
When your fair eyes these fearful lines shall read,
Deign to let fall one drop of due relief,
That may recure my heart's long pining grief,
And shew what wondrous power your beauty hath,
That can restore a damned wight from death."
43,Emotion,BeautyPoemsAThingOfBeautyEndymionPoembyJohnKeats,"A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:
Its lovliness increases; it will never
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.
Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing
A flowery band to bind us to the earth,
Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth
Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,
Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkn'd ways
Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall
From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,
Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon
For simple sheep; and such are daffodils
With the green world they live in; and clear rills
That for themselves a cooling covert make
'Gainst the hot season; the mid-forest brake,
Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:
And such too is the grandeur of the dooms
We have imagined for the mighty dead;
An endless fountain of immortal drink,
Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink."
44,Emotion,BeautyPoemsAnElegyToAnOldBeautyPoembyThomasParnell,"In vain, poor Nymph, to please our youthful sight
You sleep in cream and frontlets all the night,
Your face with patches soil, with paint repair,
Dress with gay gowns, and shade with foreign hair.
If truth in spight of manners must be told,
Why, really fifty-five is something old.
Once you were young; or one, whose life's so long
She might have born my mother, tells me wrong.
And once (since Envy's dead before you die,)
The women own, you play'd a sparkling eye,
Taught the light foot a modish little trip,
And pouted with the prettiest purple lip --
To some new charmer are the roses fled,
Which blew, to damask all thy cheek with red;
Youth calls the Graces there to fix their reign,
And airs by thousands fill their easy train.
So parting Summer bids her flow'ry prime
Attend the sun to dress some foreign clime,
While with'ring seasons in succession, here,
Strip the gay gardens, and deform the year.
But thou (since Nature bids) the world resign,
'Tis now thy daughter's daughter's time to shine.
With more address, (or such as pleases more)
She runs her female exercises o'er,
Unfurls or closes, raps or turns the Fan,
And smiles, or blushes at the creature Man.
With quicker life, as guilded coaches pass,
In sideling courtesy she drops the glass.
With better strength, on visit-days she bears
To mount her fifty flights of ample stairs.
Her mein, her shape, her temper, eyes and tongue
Are sure to conquer. -- for the rogue is young;
And all that's madly wild, or oddly gay,
We call it only pretty Fanny's way.
Let time that makes you homely, make you sage,
The sphere of wisdom is the sphere of age.
'Tis true, when beauty dawns with early fire,
And hears the flatt'ring tongues of soft desire,
If not from virtue, from its gravest ways
The soul with pleasing avocation strays.
But beauty gone, 'tis easier to be wise;
As harper better, by the loss of eyes.
Henceforth retire, reduce your roving airs,
Haunt less the plays, and more the publick pray'rs,
Reject the Mechlin Head, and gold brocade,
Go pray, in sober Norwich Crape array'd.
Thy pendent diamonds let thy Fanny take,
(Their trembling lustre shows how much you shake;)
Or bid her wear thy necklace row'd with pearl,
You'll find your Fanny an obedient girl.
So for the rest, with less incumbrance hung,
You walk thro' life, unmingled with the young;
And view the shade and substance as you pass
With joint endeavour trifling at the glass,
Or Folly drest, and rambling all her days,
To meet her counterpart, and grow by praise:
Yet still sedate your self, and gravely plain,
You neither fret, nor envy at the vain.
'Twas thus (if Man with Woman we compare)
The wise Athenian crost a glittering fair,
Unmov'd by tongues and sights, he walk'd the place,
Thro' tape, toys, tinsel, gimp, perfume, and lace;
Then bends from Mars's Hill his awful eyes,
And ""What a world I never want?"" he cries;
But cries unheard: For Folly will be free.
So parts the buzzing gaudy crowd, and he:
As careless he for them, as they for him;
He wrapt in wisdom, and they whirl'd by whim."

It's a beautiful thing to see
If you're lucky enough to see it.
It's not on my face.
Not in the eyes.
Nor on the body.
The beauty is in my soul.
Always remember that.
I may not be pretty
nor skinny.
My beauty is below my heart, in my soul.
So if you take the time
And look depper
You'll see the beauty I see!"
48,Emotion,BeautyPoemsMyIdeaOfBeautyPoembyNityaPillai,"Beauty is the sensation of your heart skipping a beat,
when eyes full of mischief glance at you...
Beauty is the smile which appears on your lips, when you think of the way he smiles at you...
Beauty is in the heart which touches another
Beauty is tender hands holding each other
Beauty is strong arms holding you warm
Beauty is in water, beauty is in weather,
beauty is in air, beauty is in life
Beauty is in love, beauty is in wind...
Beauty surrounds you days and nights
yet no one knows beauty's heights..."
49,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBeholdIAdoreBeautyPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"Beauty is warm and cold
Beauty is black and bold
Beauty is different for us all I am told
Beauty I would love a chance to mould
Beauty gives the finest pleasure I am told
Beauty can be bought and sold
To the one and only highest bidder
While it graciously glitters like gold
I adore beauty
Oh! How I adore beauty with a passion
I adore beauty with every last breath
Beauty itself is not exempt
From the laws of birth and death
It experiences the joys of being young and old
Blossoming each day in early youth
Maturing adoringly each day with age
Behold, I adore beauty
Oh! How I adore beauty with a passion
Beauty is something I would like to hold
Where there is too much ugly
I can bring it out of a drawer and unfold
Spread it around the entire household
Without worrying about getting a scold
Behold, I adore beauty
Oh! How I adore beauty
When out on a nightie
Quite hungry and thirsty
And you drink the last drops of milk
From a beautiful chest that is busty
I would say, that itself is a faculty of beauty

50,Emotion,BeautyPoemsShallowBeautyPoembyJonLloyd,"It's unlikely but true -
Your physical attraction
Entertains me
On so many levels.
Your voice as smooth as slate
But subtle - soft and subtle -
And untarnished by locality
Draws my soul.
You utter practical nothings
Statistical representations
Cardboard cut-out numbers
Meaningless drivel;
I want to hear you speak
Of more important things -
Of life and loves and instincts
But am denied.

51,Emotion,BeautyPoemsClickHereToListenToTheBeautyOfNatureTheBeautyOfNaturePoembyWinifredBullard,"The falling of snowflakes coming down
Making a blanket of white on the ground.
Autumn with red and gold-leaves,
Falling to the ground, in a cool breeze.
The rising of the sun of crimson,
A buzzing of the Bees,
As they go on their mission.
A cool-breese blowing in the trees.
The beautiful- flowers of red, yellow, and blue.
The sparkling of grass, with morning-dew.
The sea is beautiful, with Blue-sky above.
The flying of sea-gulls and of doves.
The birds singing up in the trees,
As a gentle-wind blows the green-leaves.
Beautiful-butterflies going their way.
The beauty of nature, really make my day!"
52,Emotion,BeautyPoemsRondelOfMercilessBeautyPoembyGeoffreyChaucer,"Your two great eyes will slay me suddenly;
Their beauty shakes me who was once serene;
Straight through my heart the wound is quick and keen.
Only your word will heal the injury
To my hurt heart, while yet the wound is clean -
Your two great eyes will slay me suddenly;
Their beauty shakes me who was once serene.
Upon my word, I tell you faithfully
Through life and after death you are my queen;
For with my death the whole truth shall be seen.
Your two great eyes will slay me suddenly;
Their beauty shakes me who was once serene;
Straight through my heart the wound is quick and keen."
53,Emotion,BeautyPoemsFindingBeautyPoembyAngelaDavis,"I went for a walk with my love
down to an old vacant lot she took me
littered, and broken up
it made me sad,
made me think of myself
I asked why she took me there
she silently smiled
and took my hand
led me to a place
The pavement was cracked
the ground heaped with garbage
old and new
near a makeshift shelter
that some one had left
She kissed my tears away
told me to smile
when I asked why
she told me to open my eyes
leaving me confused
she said to look at the beauty
surrounding us
then began to point
the doorway of the crude shack
was open, and the was a spiderweb
moist with the morning dew
small dropp formed at it ran down
and it was beautiful
A few feet away
there was a daffodil
growing, thriving
despite the battered tarmac
through which it found a way
standing tall and proud
as well it should
and it was beautiful
Just then we looked up
and what did we see
a blue jay landing atop the roof
and began singing it's song
The sun was rising
peaking over the horizon
painting it red, orange,
yellow, and even violet
the sky was it's canvas
and it was beautiful
She took me home
pointing at many other things
while we strolled home
when we got there
I thanked her
told her she was beautiful
she stood me in front a mirror
telling me to find the beauty
there we stood for many long minutes
I looked, I saw, I contemplated
the sorrow carved into my features
the gentle wonder in my eyes
the scars life has left upon me
and it was beautiful"
54,Emotion,BeautyPoems3TheCurseOfBeautyDrinkersPoembyLuisGildelaPuente,"We can appreciate the energy in art
and feel strong in the transfusion,
but then time keeps dripping,
the curse of the beauty drinker.
Surrogate life,
virtual, safe, mediocre.
Looking in the usual wrong places,
we´ll never get to know
what we want.
I am able to believe anything,
to deceive myself once more.
Do we need a miracle?
In the meantime,
silently,
the mysterious order of truth
moves forward."
55,Emotion,BeautyPoemsGeniusInBeautyPoembyDanteGabrielRossetti,"Beauty like hers is genius. Not the call
Of Homer's or of Dante's heart sublime, --
Not Michael's hand furrowing the zones of time, --
Is more with compassed mysteries musical;
Nay, not in Spring's Summer's sweet footfall
More gathered gifts exuberant Life bequeaths
Than doth this sovereign face, whose love-spell breathes
Even from its shadowed contour on the wall.
As many men are poets in their youth,
But for one sweet-strung soul the wires prolong
Even through all change the indomitable song;
So in likewise the envenomed years, whose tooth
Rends shallower grace with ruin void of truth,
Upon this beauty's power shall wreak no wrong."
56,Emotion,BeautyPoemsIngratefulBeautyThreatenedPoembyThomasCarew,"Know Celia, since thou art so proud,
'Twas I that gave thee thy renown;
Thou hadst, in the forgotten crowd
Of common beauties, liv'd unknown,
Had not my verse exhal'd thy name,
And with it imp'd the wings of fame.
That killing power is none of thine,
I gave it to thy voice, and eyes;
Thy sweets, thy graces, all are mine;
Thou art my star, shin'st in my skies;
Then dart not from thy borrow'd sphere
Lightning on him that fix'd thee there.
Tempt me with such affrights no more,
Lest what I made, I uncreate;
Let fools thy mystic forms adore,
I'll know thee in thy mortal state;
Wise poets that wrapp'd Truth in tales,
Knew her themselves, through all her veils."
57,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBeforeTheThroneOfBeautyXxviPoembyKhalilGibran,"One heavy day I ran away from the grim face of society and the dizzying clamor of the city and directed my weary step to the spacious alley. I pursued the beckoning course of the rivulet and the musical sounds of the birds until I reached a lonely spot where the flowing branches of the trees prevented the sun from the touching the earth.
I stood there, and it was entertaining to my soul - my thirsty soul who had seen naught but the mirage of life instead of its sweetness.
I was engrossed deeply in thought and my spirits were sailing the firmament when a hour, wearing a sprig of grapevine that covered part of her naked body, and a wreath of poppies about her golden hair, suddenly appeared to me. As she she realized my astonishment, she greeted me saying, 'Fear me not; I am the Nymph of the Jungle.'
'How can beauty like yours be committed to live in this place? Please tell me who your are, and whence you come? ' I asked. She sat gracefully on the green grass and responded, 'I am the symbol of nature! I am the ever virgin your forefathers worshipped, and to my honor they erected shrines and temples at Baalbek and Jbeil.' And I dared say, 'But those temples and shrines were laid waste and the bones of my adoring ancestors became a part of the earth; nothing was left to commemorate their goddess save a pitiful few and the forgotten pages in the book of history.'
She replied, 'Some goddesses live in the lives of their worshippers and die in their deaths, while some live an eternal and infinite life. My life is sustained by the world of beauty which you will see where ever you rest your eyes, and this beauty is nature itself; it is the beginning of the shepherds joy among the hills, and a villagers happiness in the fields, and the pleasure of the awe filled tribes between the mountains and the plains. This Beauty promotes the wise into the throne the truth.'
Then I said, 'Beauty is a terrible power! ' And she retorted, 'Human beings fear all things, even yourselves. You fear heaven, the source of spiritual peace; you fear nature, the haven of rest and tranquility; you fear the God of goodness and accuse him of anger, while he is full of love and mercy.'
After a deep silence, mingled with sweet dreams, I asked, 'Speak to me of that beauty which the people interpret and define, each one according to his own conception; I have seen her honored and worshipped in different ways and manners.'
She answered, 'Beauty is that which attracts your soul, and that which loves to give and not to receive. When you meet Beauty, you feel that the hands deep within your inner self are stretched forth to bring her into the domain of your heart. It is the magnificence combined of sorrow and joy; it is the Unseen which you see, and the Vague which you understand, and the Mute which you hear - it is the Holy of Holies that begins in yourself and ends vastly beyond your earthly imagination.'
Then the Nymph of the Jungle approached me and laid her scented hands upon my eyes. And as she withdrew, I found me alone in the valley. When I returned to the city, whose turbulence no longer vexed me, I repeated her words:
'Beauty is that which attracts your soul, and that which loves to give and not to receive.'"
58,Emotion,BeautyPoemsOdeToBeautyPoembyRalphWaldoEmerson,"Who gave thee, O Beauty!
The keys of this breast,
Too credulous lover
Of blest and unblest?
Say when in lapsed ages
Thee knew I of old;
Or what was the service
For which I was sold?
When first my eyes saw thee,
I found me thy thrall,
By magical drawings,
Sweet tyrant of all!
I drank at thy fountain
False waters of thirst;
Thou intimate stranger,
Thou latest and first!
Thy dangerous glances
Make women of men;
New-born we are melting
Into nature again.
Lavish, lavish promiser,
Nigh persuading gods to err,
Guest of million painted forms
Which in turn thy glory warms,
The frailest leaf, the mossy bark,
The acorn's cup, the raindrop's arc,
The swinging spider's silver line,
The ruby of the drop of wine,
The shining pebble of the pond,
Thou inscribest with a bond
In thy momentary play
Would bankrupt Nature to repay.
Ah! what avails it
To hide or to shun
Whom the Infinite One
Hath granted his throne?
The heaven high over
Is the deep's lover,
The sun and sea
Informed by thee,
Before me run,
And draw me on,
Yet fly me still,
As Fate refuses
To me the heart Fate for me chooses,
Is it that my opulent soul
Was mingled from the generous whole,
Sea valleys and the deep of skies
Furnished several supplies,
And the sands whereof I'm made
Draw me to them self-betrayed?
I turn the proud portfolios
Which hold the grand designs
Of Salvator, of Guercino,
And Piranesi's lines.
I hear the lofty Pæans
Of the masters of the shell,
Who heard the starry music,
And recount the numbers well:
Olympian bards who sung
Divine Ideas below,
Which always find us young,
And always keep us so.
Oft in streets or humblest places
I detect far wandered graces,
Which from Eden wide astray
In lowly homes have lost their way.
Thee gliding through the sea of form,
Like the lightning through the storm,
Somewhat not to be possessed,
Somewhat not to be caressed,
No feet so fleet could ever find,
No perfect form could ever bind.
Thou eternal fugitive
Hovering over all that live,
Quick and skilful to inspire
Sweet extravagant desire,
Starry space and lily bell
Filling with thy roseate smell,
Wilt not give the lips to taste
Of the nectar which thou hast.
All that's good and great with thee
Stands in deep conspiracy.
Thou hast bribed the dark and lonely
To report thy features only,
And the cold and purple morning
Itself with thoughts of thee adorning,
The leafy dell, the city mart,
Equal trophies of thine art,
E'en the flowing azure air
Thou hast touched for my despair,
And if I languish into dreams,
Again I meet the ardent beams.
Queen of things! I dare not die
In Being's deeps past ear and eye,
Lest there I find the same deceiver,
And be the sport of Fate forever.
Dread power, but dear! if God thou be,
Unmake me quite, or give thyself to me."
59,Emotion,BeautyPoemsSonnetBeautyPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"The flesh gets beauty, when draped by its skin;
The soul loses beauty, when filled by sin;
The beauty of things is seen when revealed;
The beauty of unseen things is concealed.
Woman! Thy beauty is in concealment;
Nature, thy beauty is the Firmament;
O Man! Thy beauty is by revealing;
Heart, Thy beauty is in deep feeling.
The Grace of God is the dress of the soul!
The Stars, Sun and Moon- the dress of the ‘bowl’! ’
Just as how skin protects the body’s flesh,
Good deeds make a soul beautiful and fresh.
Doing good in life is most important;
Avoiding harm is more significant.

60,Emotion,BeautyPoemsTheEyeOfBeautyPoembyMichaelShepherd,"Krishna passed that mountain many times;
and yet his followers observed that day
that all his mind was filled with fresh delight
as if he'd never walked, nor seen, that way;
the beauty of the mountain ever new,
the moment of its sight, the world reborn;
the mind surprised by what it always knew:
the beauty past all beauty's name and form.
This is true beauty, in ourself revealed:
a sight that's ever fresh, yet ever known;
which eye sees pure, yet mind too oft conceals:
God's unity, in beauty seen; all, One;
The moment's grace of beauty, ours all day;
from outward eye the sight of inward Way."
61,Emotion,BeautyPoemsHymnToIntellectualBeautyPoembyPercyByssheShelley,"The awful shadow of some unseen Power
Floats through unseen among us, -- visiting
This various world with as inconstant wing
As summer winds that creep from flower to flower, --
Like moonbeams that behind some piny mountain shower,
It visits with inconstant glance
Each human heart and countenance;
Like hues and harmonies of evening, --
Like clouds in starlight widely spread, --
Like memory of music fled, --
Like aught that for its grace may be
Dear, and yet dearer for its mystery.
Spirit of Beauty, that dost consecrate
With thine own hues all thou dost shine upon
Of human thought or form, -- where art thou gone?
Why dost thou pass away and leave our state,
This dim vast vale of tears, vacant and desolate?
Ask why the sunlight not for ever
Weaves rainbows o'er yon mountain-river,
Why aught should fail and fade that once is shown,
Why fear and dream and death and birth
Cast on the daylight of this earth
Such gloom, -- why man has such a scope
For love and hate, despondency and hope?
No voice from some sublimer world hath ever
To sage or poet these responses given --
Therefore the names of Demon, Ghost, and Heaven,
Remain the records of their vain endeavour,
Frail spells -- whose uttered charm might not avail to sever,
From all we hear and all we see,
Doubt, chance, and mutability.
Thy light alone -- like mist oe'er the mountains driven,
Or music by the night-wind sent
Through strings of some still instrument,
Or moonlight on a midnight stream,
Gives grace and truth to life's unquiet dream.
Love, Hope, and Self-esteem, like clouds depart
And come, for some uncertain moments lent.
Man were immortal, and omnipotent,
Didst thou, unknown and awful as thou art,
Keep with thy glorious train firm state within his heart.
Thou messgenger of sympathies,
That wax and wane in lovers' eyes --
Thou -- that to human thought art nourishment,
Like darkness to a dying flame!
Depart not as thy shadow came,
Depart not -- lest the grave should be,
Like life and fear, a dark reality.
While yet a boy I sought for ghosts, and sped
Through many a listening chamber, cave and ruin,
And starlight wood, with fearful steps pursuing
Hopes of high talk with the departed dead.
I called on poisonous names with which our youth is fed;
I was not heard -- I saw them not --
When musing deeply on the lot
Of life, at that sweet time when winds are wooing
All vital things that wake to bring
News of birds and blossoming, --
Sudden, thy shadow fell on me;
I shrieked, and clasped my hands in ecstasy!
I vowed that I would dedicate my powers
To thee and thine -- have I not kept the vow?
With beating heart and streaming eyes, even now
I call the phantoms of a thousand hours
Each from his voiceless grave: they have in visioned bowers
Of studious zeal or love's delight
Outwatched with me the envious night --
They know that never joy illumed my brow
Unlinked with hope that thou wouldst free
This world from its dark slavery,
That thou - O awful Loveliness,
Wouldst give whate'er these words cannot express.
The day becomes more solemn and serene
When noon is past -- there is a harmony
In autumn, and a lustre in its sky,
Which through the summer is not heard or seen,
As if it could not be, as if it had not been!
Thus let thy power, which like the truth
Of nature on my passive youth
Descended, to my onward life supply
Its calm -- to one who worships thee,
And every form containing thee,
Whom, Spirit fair, thy spells did bind
To fear himself, and love all human kind."
62,Emotion,BeautyPoemsAmericanBeautyPoembyCarolynKizer,"For Ann London
As you described your mastectomy in calm detail
and bared your chest so I might see
the puckered scar,
""They took a hatchet to your breast!"" I said. ""What an
Amazon you are.""
When we were girls we climbed Mt. Tamalpais
chewing bay leaves we had plucked
along the way;
we got high all right, from animal pleasure in each other,
shouting to the sky.
On your houseboat we tried to ignore the impossible guy
you had married to enrage your family,
a typical ploy.
We were great fools let loose in the No Name bar
on Sausalito's bay.
In San Francisco we'd perch on a waterfront pier
chewing sourdough and cheese, swilling champagne,
kicking our heels;
crooning lewd songs, hooting like seagulls,
we bayed with the seals.
Then you married someone in Mexico,
broke up in two weeks, didn't bother to divorce,
claimed it didn't count.
You dumped number three, fled to Albany
to become a pedant.
Averse to domesticity, you read for your Ph.D.
Your four-year-old looked like a miniature
John Lennon.
You fed him peanut butter from your jar and raised him
on Beowulf and Grendal.
Much later in New York we reunited;
in an elevator at Sak's a woman asked for
your autograph.
You glowed like a star, like Anouk Aimee
at forty, close enough.
Your pedantry found its place in the Women's Movement.
You rose fast, seen suddenly as the morning star;
wrote the ERA
found the right man at last, a sensitive artist;
flying too high
not to crash. When the cancer caught you
you went on talk shows to say you had no fear
or faith.
In Baltimore we joked on your bed as you turned into
a witty wraith.
When you died I cleaned out your bureau drawers:
your usual disorder; an assortment of gorgeous wigs
and prosthetic breasts
tossed in garbage bags, to spare your gentle spouse.
Then the bequests
you had made to every friend you had!
For each of us a necklace or a ring.
A snapshot for me:
We two, barefoot in chiffon, laughing amid blossoms
your last wedding day."
63,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBeautyPoembyEdwinaMatthews,"Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder
Beauty is in all things.
Beauty is in the sky.
Beauty is in the water ever so blue.
Beauty is the winter when trees are covered with snow.
Beauty is the summer when you smell and see the flowers grow.
Beauty is all things big and little.
Beauty is in all things,
Black and white.
Beauty is in all things, you and me.
Beauty is all around us...can't you see?"
64,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBeautyOfASummersDayPoembyJosephTRenaldi,"The beauty of a Summer's day begins
Watching the bright, morning sun rise,
Dew upon the lawn and roses,
And the early flight of colorful butterflies.
The beauty of a Summer's day
Is an attractive and picturesque one,
A sky of a variable color of pale to light blue,
And sport and entertainment for everyone.
The beauty of a Summer's day
Is stetched with green foliage on the hill,
And colorful wildflowers bordering the roadway,
The water wheel turning at the grist mill.
The beauty of a Summer's day increases
Watching the rolling waves of the ocean,
Sea shells washing upon the sandy shore,
And gazing at the sea gulls gliding in slow motion.
The finality of a Summer's day
Is depicted with memorable scenes
Of picnicking, camping, swimming, and traveling,
Reserved for Summer enthusiasts for future dreams."
65,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBeautyXxvPoembyKhalilGibran,"And a poet said, 'Speak to us of Beauty.'
Where shall you seek beauty, and how shall you find her unless she herself be your way and your guide?
And how shall you speak of her except she be the weaver of your speech?
The aggrieved and the injured say, 'Beauty is kind and gentle.
Like a young mother half-shy of her own glory she walks among us.'
And the passionate say, 'Nay, beauty is a thing of might and dread.
Like the tempest she shakes the earth beneath us and the sky above us.'
The tired and the weary say, 'beauty is of soft whisperings. She speaks in our spirit.
Her voice yields to our silences like a faint light that quivers in fear of the shadow.'
But the restless say, 'We have heard her shouting among the mountains,
And with her cries came the sound of hoofs, and the beating of wings and the roaring of lions.'
At night the watchmen of the city say, 'Beauty shall rise with the dawn from the east.'
And at noontide the toilers and the wayfarers say, 'we have seen her leaning over the earth from the windows of the sunset.'
In winter say the snow-bound, 'She shall come with the spring leaping upon the hills.'
And in the summer heat the reapers say, 'We have seen her dancing with the autumn leaves, and we saw a drift of snow in her hair.'
All these things have you said of beauty.
Yet in truth you spoke not of her but of needs unsatisfied,
And beauty is not a need but an ecstasy.
It is not a mouth thirsting nor an empty hand stretched forth,
But rather a heart enflamed and a soul enchanted.
It is not the image you would see nor the song you would hear,
But rather an image you see though you close your eyes and a song you hear though you shut your ears.
It is not the sap within the furrowed bark, nor a wing attached to a claw,
But rather a garden forever in bloom and a flock of angels for ever in flight.
People of Orphalese, beauty is life when life unveils her holy face.
But you are life and you are the veil.
Beauty is eternity gazing at itself in a mirror.
But you are eternity and you are the mirror."
66,Emotion,BeautyPoemsTheBeautyOfDeathXivPoembyKhalilGibran,"Part One - The Calling
Let me sleep, for my soul is intoxicated with love and
Let me rest, for my spirit has had its bounty of days and nights;
Light the candles and burn the incense around my bed, and
Scatter leaves of jasmine and roses over my body;
Embalm my hair with frankincense and sprinkle my feet with perfume,
And read what the hand of Death has written on my forehead.
Let me rest in the arms of Slumber, for my open eyes are tired;
Let the silver-stringed lyre quiver and soothe my spirit;
Weave from the harp and lute a veil around my withering heart.
Sing of the past as you behold the dawn of hope in my eyes, for
It's magic meaning is a soft bed upon which my heart rests.
Dry your tears, my friends, and raise your heads as the flowers
Raise their crowns to greet the dawn.
Look at the bride of Death standing like a column of light
Between my bed and the infinite;
Hold your breath and listen with me to the beckoning rustle of
Her white wings.
Come close and bid me farewell; touch my eyes with smiling lips.
Let the children grasp my hands with soft and rosy fingers;
Let the ages place their veined hands upon my head and bless me;
Let the virgins come close and see the shadow of God in my eyes,
And hear the echo of His will racing with my breath.
Part Two - The Ascending
I have passed a mountain peak and my soul is soaring in the
Firmament of complete and unbound freedom;
I am far, far away, my companions, and the clouds are
Hiding the hills from my eyes.
The valleys are becoming flooded with an ocean of silence, and the
Hands of oblivion are engulfing the roads and the houses;
The prairies and fields are disappearing behind a white specter
That looks like the spring cloud, yellow as the candlelight
And red as the twilight.
The songs of the waves and the hymns of the streams
Are scattered, and the voices of the throngs reduced to silence;
And I can hear naught but the music of Eternity
In exact harmony with the spirit's desires.
I am cloaked in full whiteness;
I am in comfort; I am in peace.
Part Three - The Remains
Unwrap me from this white linen shroud and clothe me
With leaves of jasmine and lilies;
Take my body from the ivory casket and let it rest
Upon pillows of orange blossoms.
Lament me not, but sing songs of youth and joy;
Shed not tears upon me, but sing of harvest and the winepress;
Utter no sigh of agony, but draw upon my face with your
Finger the symbol of Love and Joy.
Disturb not the air's tranquility with chanting and requiems,
But let your hearts sing with me the song of Eternal Life;
Mourn me not with apparel of black,
But dress in color and rejoice with me;
Talk not of my departure with sighs in your hearts; close
Your eyes and you will see me with you forevermore.
Place me upon clusters of leaves and
Carry my upon your friendly shoulders and
Walk slowly to the deserted forest.
Take me not to the crowded burying ground lest my slumber
Be disrupted by the rattling of bones and skulls.
Carry me to the cypress woods and dig my grave where violets
And poppies grow not in the other's shadow;
Let my grave be deep so that the flood will not
Carry my bones to the open valley;
Let my grace be wide, so that the twilight shadows
Will come and sit by me.
Take from me all earthly raiment and place me deep in my
Mother Earth; and place me with care upon my mother's breast.
Cover me with soft earth, and let each handful be mixed
With seeds of jasmine, lilies and myrtle; and when they
Grow above me, and thrive on my body's element they will
Breathe the fragrance of my heart into space;
And reveal even to the sun the secret of my peace;
And sail with the breeze and comfort the wayfarer.
Leave me then, friends - leave me and depart on mute feet,
As the silence walks in the deserted valley;
Leave me to God and disperse yourselves slowly, as the almond
And apple blossoms disperse under the vibration of Nisan's breeze.
Go back to the joy of your dwellings and you will find there
That which Death cannot remove from you and me.
Leave with place, for what you see here is far away in meaning
From the earthly world. Leave me."
67,Emotion,BeautyPoemsAmericanBeautyPoembyLouisMcKee,"The perfect American Beauty Rose,
is it diminished
by the slag heaps on Rt. 11, just west
of Scranton, or by the dark cloud
that seems to have settled an inch or so
beneath the surface of Lake Naomi,
or even the swell of soot that hangs
like a troubling thought over the town
on the other side of the river?
Is the rose there any less beautiful?
Or this woman here; right now
she is standing in the impatient way
women have, a hip thrust out,
a shoulder let low?  She is casual
this Sunday morning, in jeans
and a simple top, and she stands
at the top of the hill holding a cigarette
and a leash, waiting for her dog to return.
You'll have to take my word for this:
she is as lovely as any rose
you'll ever find on those long walks you take
into the mountains, and nothing about her
is diminished by the bombs that are falling
this very moment on Afghanistan, the lies
packed tight and neat into cartons
and stacked with the rest in basements,
warehouses and storage rentals
throughout Washington, the three point shot
dropping like a rock short of the basket
in the final seconds of an important moment
in someone's life.  In fact, it is just the opposite:
the grays around us fade—not reduced, no,
nor chased away—but lost to the flush
beauty of the red rose, of the women,
in a moment appreciated.
Anonymous submission."
68,Emotion,BeautyPoemsSongMurderingBeautyPoembyThomasCarew,"I'LL gaze no more on her bewitching face,
Since ruin harbours there in every place ;
For my enchanted soul alike she drowns
With calms and tempests of her smiles and frowns.
I’ll love no more those cruel eyes of hers,
Which, pleased or anger’d, still are murderers :
For if she dart, like lightning, through the air
Her beams of wrath, she kills me with despair :
If she behold me with a pleasing eye,
I surfeit with excess of joy, and die."

Thou in me kindlest much more great desire,
And up aloft above my strength dost raise
The wondrous matter of my fire to praise.
That as I erst in praise of thine own name,
So now in honour of thy mother dear,
An honourable hymn I eke should frame,
And with the brightness of her beauty clear,
The ravish'd hearts of gazeful men might rear
To admiration of that heavenly light,
From whence proceeds such soul-enchanting might.
Thereto do thou, great goddess, queen of beauty,
Mother of love, and of all world's delight,
Without whose sovereign grace and kindly duty
Nothing on earth seems fair to fleshly sight,
Do thou vouchsafe with thy love-kindling light
T' illuminate my dim and dulled eyne,
And beautify this sacred hymn of thine:
That both to thee, to whom I mean it most,
And eke to her, whose fair immortal beam
Hath darted fire into my feeble ghost,
That now it wasted is with woes extreme,
It may so please, that she at length will stream
Some dew of grace into my withered heart,
After long sorrow and consuming smart.
WHAT time this world's great Workmaster did cast
To make all things such as we now behold,
It seems that he before his eyes had plac'd
A goodly pattern, to whose perfect mould
He fashion'd them as comely as he could;
That now so fair and seemly they appear,
As nought may be amended anywhere.
That wondrous pattern, wheresoe'er it be,
Whether in earth laid up in secret store,
Or else in heaven, that no man may it see
With sinful eyes, for fear it to deflore,
Is perfect Beauty, which all men adore;
Whose face and feature doth so much excel
All mortal sense, that none the same may tell.
Thereof as every earthly thing partakes
Or more or less, by influence divine,
So it more fair accordingly it makes,
And the gross matter of this earthly mine,
Which clotheth it, thereafter doth refine,
Doing away the dross which dims the light
Of that fair beam which therein is empight.
For, through infusion of celestial power,
The duller earth it quick'neth with delight,
And lifeful spirits privily doth pour
Through all the parts, that to the looker's sight
They seem to please. That is thy sovereign might,
O Cyprian queen, which flowing from the beam
Of thy bright star, thou into them dost stream.
That is the thing which giveth pleasant grace
To all things fair, that kindleth lively fire,
Light of thy lamp, which, shining in the face,
Thence to the soul darts amorous desire,
And robs the hearts of those which it admire;
Therewith thou pointest thy son's poison'd arrow,
That wounds the life, and wastes the inmost marrow.
How vainly then do idle wits invent,
That beauty is nought else but mixture made
Of colours fair, and goodly temp'rament
Of pure complexions, that shall quickly fade
And pass away, like to a summer's shade;
Or that it is but comely composition
Of parts well measur'd, with meet disposition.
Hath white and red in it such wondrous power,
That it can pierce through th' eyes unto the heart,
And therein stir such rage and restless stour,
As nought but death can stint his dolour's smart?
Or can proportion of the outward part
Move such affection in the inward mind,
That it can rob both sense and reason blind?
Why do not then the blossoms of the field,
Which are array'd with much more orient hue,
And to the sense most dainty odours yield,
Work like impression in the looker's view?
Or why do not fair pictures like power shew,
In which oft-times we nature see of art
Excell'd, in perfect limning every part?
But ah, believe me, there is more than so,
That works such wonders in the minds of men;
I, that have often prov'd, too well it know,
And whoso list the like assays to ken,
Shall find by trial, and confess it then,
That beauty is not, as fond men misdeem,
An outward shew of things, that only seem.
For that same goodly hue of white and red,
With which the cheeks are sprinkled, shall decay,
And those sweet rosy leaves, so fairly spread
Upon the lips, shall fade and fall away
To that they were, even to corrupted clay;
That golden wire, those sparkling stars so bright,
Shall turn to dust; and lose their goodly light.
But that fair lamp, from whose celestial ray
That light proceeds, which kindleth lovers' fire,
Shall never be extinguish'd nor decay;
But when the vital spirits do expire,
Unto her native planet shall retire;
For it is heavenly born and cannot die,
Being a parcel of the purest sky.
For when the soul, the which derived was,
At first, out of that great immortal Spright,
By whom all live to love, whilom did pass
Down from the top of purest heaven's height
To be embodied here, it then took light
And lively spirits from that fairest star,
Which lights the world forth from his fiery car.
Which power retaining still or more or less,
When she in fleshly seed is eft enraced,
Through every part she doth the same impress,
According as the heavens have her graced,
And frames her house, in which she will be placed,
Fit for herself, adorning it with spoil
Of th' heavenly riches which she robb'd erewhile.
Thereof it comes that these fair souls, which have
The most resemblance of that heavenly light,
Frame to themselves most beautiful and brave
Their fleshly bower, most fit for their delight,
And the gross matter by a sovereign might
Tempers so trim, that it may well be seen
A palace fit for such a virgin queen.
So every spirit, as it is most pure,
And hath in it the more of heavenly light,
So it the fairer body doth procure
To habit in, and it more fairly dight
With cheerful grace and amiable sight.
For of the soul the body form doth take:
For soul is form, and doth the body make.
Therefore wherever that thou dost behold
A comely corpse, with beauty fair endued,
Know this for certain, that the same doth hold
A beauteous soul, with fair conditions thewed,
Fit to receive the seed of virtue strewed.
For all that fair is, is by nature good;
That is a sign to know the gentle blood.
Yet oft it falls that many a gentle mind
Dwells in deformed tabernacle drown'd,
Either by chance, against the course of kind,
Or through unaptness in the substance found,
Which it assumed of some stubborn ground,
That will not yield unto her form's direction,
But is deform'd with some foul imperfection.
And oft it falls, (ay me, the more to rue)
That goodly beauty, albe heavenly born,
Is foul abus'd, and that celestial hue,
Which doth the world with her delight adorn,
Made but the bait of sin, and sinners' scorn,
Whilst every one doth seek and sue to have it,
But every one doth seek but to deprave it.
Yet nathëmore is that fair beauty's blame,
But theirs that do abuse it unto ill:
Nothing so good, but that through guilty shame
May be corrupt, and wrested unto will:
Natheless the soul is fair and beauteous still,
However flesh{""e}s fault it filthy make;
For things immortal no corruption take.
But ye fair dames, the world's dear ornaments
And lively images of heaven's light,
Let not your beams with such disparagements
Be dimm'd, and your bright glory dark'ned quite;
But mindful still of your first country's sight,
Do still preserve your first informed grace,
Whose shadow yet shines in your beauteous face.
Loathe that foul blot, that hellish firebrand,
Disloyal lust, fair beauty's foulest blame,
That base affections, which your ears would bland,
Commend to you by love's abused name,
But is indeed the bondslave of defame;
Which will the garland of your glory mar,
And quench the light of your bright shining star.
But gentle Love, that loyal is and true,
Will more illumine your resplendent ray,
And add more brightness to your goodly hue,
From light of his pure fire; which, by like way
Kindled of yours, your likeness doth display;
Like as two mirrors, by oppos'd reflection,
Do both express the face's first impression.
Therefore, to make your beauty more appear,
It you behoves to love, and forth to lay
That heavenly riches which in you ye bear,
That men the more admire their fountain may;
For else what booteth that celestial ray,
If it in darkness be enshrined ever,
That it of loving eyes be viewed never?
But, in your choice of loves, this well advise,
That likest to yourselves ye them select,
The which your forms' first source may sympathize,
And with like beauty's parts be inly deckt;
For, if you loosely love without respect,
It is no love, but a discordant war,
Whose unlike parts amongst themselves do jar.
For love is a celestial harmony
Of likely hearts compos'd of stars' concent,
Which join together in sweet sympathy,
To work each other's joy and true content,
Which they have harbour'd since their first descent
Out of their heavenly bowers, where they did see
And know each other here belov'd to be.
Then wrong it were that any other twain
Should in love's gentle band combined be
But those whom Heaven did at first ordain,
And made out of one mould the more t' agree;
For all that like the beauty which they see,
Straight do not love; for love is not so light
As straight to burn at first beholder's sight.
But they, which love indeed, look otherwise,
With pure regard and spotless true intent,
Drawing out of the object of their eyes
A more refined form, which they present
Unto their mind, void of all blemishment;
Which it reducing to her first perfection,
Beholdeth free from flesh's frail infection.
And then conforming it unto the light,
Which in itself it hath remaining still,
Of that first Sun, yet sparkling in his sight,
Thereof he fashions in his higher skill
An heavenly beauty to his fancy's will;
And it embracing in his mind entire,
The mirror of his own thought doth admire.
Which seeing now so inly fair to be,
As outward it appeareth to the eye,
And with his spirit's proportion to agree,
He thereon fixeth all his fantasy,
And fully setteth his felicity;
Counting it fairer than it is indeed,
And yet indeed her fairness doth exceed.
For lovers' eyes more sharply sighted be
Than other men's, and in dear love's delight
See more than any other eyes can see,
Through mutual receipt of beam{""e}s bright,
Which carry privy message to the spright,
And to their eyes that inmost fair display,
As plain as light discovers dawning day.
Therein they see, through amorous eye-glances,
Armies of loves still flying to and fro,
Which dart at them their little fiery lances;
Whom having wounded, back again they go,
Carrying compassion to their lovely foe;
Who, seeing her fair eyes' so sharp effect,
Cures all their sorrows with one sweet aspect.
In which how many wonders do they rede
To their conceit, that others never see,
Now of her smiles, with which their souls they feed,
Like gods with nectar in their banquets free;
Now of her looks, which like to cordials be;
But when her words' embássade forth she sends,
Lord, how sweet music that unto them lends.
Sometimes upon her forehead they behold
A thousand graces masking in delight;
Sometimes within her eyelids they unfold
Ten thousand sweet belgards, which to their sight
Do seem like twinkling stars in frosty night;
But on her lips, like rosy buds in May,
So many millions of chaste pleasures play.
All those, O Cytherea, and thousands more
Thy handmaids be, which do on thee attend,
To deck thy beauty with their dainties' store,
That may it more to mortal eyes commend,
And make it more admir'd of foe and friend:
That in men's hearts thou may'st thy throne install,
And spread thy lovely kingdom over all.
Then Iö, triumph! O great Beauty's Queen,
Advance the banner of thy conquest high,
That all this world, the which thy vassals bene,
May draw to thee, and with due fealty
Adore the power of thy great majesty,
Singing this hymn in honour of thy name,
Compil'd by me, which thy poor liegeman am.
In lieu whereof grant, O great sovereign,
That she whose conquering beauty doth captive
My trembling heart in her eternal chain,
One drop of grace at length will to me give,
That I her bounden thrall by her may live,
And this same life, which first fro me she reaved,
May owe to her, of whom I it received.
And you, fair Venus' darling, my dear dread,
Fresh flower of grace, great goddess of my life,
When your fair eyes these fearful lines shall read,
Deign to let fall one drop of due relief,
That may recure my heart's long pining grief,
And shew what wondrous power your beauty hath,
That can restore a damned wight from death."
70,Emotion,BeautyPoemsFromTheTestamentOfBeautyPoembyRobertSeymourBridges,"'Twas at that hour of beauty when the setting sun
squandereth his cloudy bed with rosy hues, to flood
his lov'd works as in turn he biddeth them Good-night;
and all the towers and temples and mansions of men
face him in bright farewell, ere they creep from their pomp
naked beneath the darkness;- while to mortal eyes
'tis given, ifso they close not of fatigue, nor strain
at lamplit tasks-'tis given, as for a royal boon
to beggarly outcasts in homeless vigil, to watch
where uncurtain's behind the great windows of space
Heav'n's jewel'd company circleth unapproachably-
'Twas at sunset that I, fleeing to hide my soul
in refuge of beauty from a mortal distress,
walk'd alone with the Muse in her garden of thought,
discoursing at liberty with the mazy dreams
that came wavering pertinaciously about me; as when
the small bats, issued from their hangings, flitter o'erhead
thru' the summer twilight, with thin cries to and fro
hunting in muffled flight atween the stars and flowers.
Then fell I in strange delusion, illusion strange to tell;
for as a man who lyeth fast asleep in his bed
may dream he waketh, and that he walketh upright
pursuing some endeavour in full conscience-so 'twas
with me; but contrawise; for being in truth awake
methought I slept and dreamt; and in thatt dream methought
I was telling a dream; nor telling was I as one
who, truly awaked from a true sleep, thinketh to tell
his dream to a friend, but for his scant remembrances
findeth no token of speech-it was not so with me;
for my tale was my dream and my dream the telling,
and I remember wondring the while I told it
how I told it so tellingly.  And yet now 'twould seem
that Reason inveighed me with her old orderings;
as once when she took thought to adjust theology,
peopling the inane that vex'd her between God and man
with a hierarchy of angels; like those asteroids
wherewith she later fill'd the gap 'twixt Jove and Mars.
Verily by Beauty it is that we come as WISDOM,
yet not by Reason at Beauty; and now with many words
pleasing myself betimes I am fearing lest in the end
I play the tedious orator who maundereth on
for lack of heart to make an end of his nothings.
Wherefor as when a runner who hath run his round
handeth his staff away, and is glad of his rest,
here break I off, knowing the goal was not for me
the while I ran on telling of what cannot be told.
For not the Muse herself can tell of Goddes love;
which cometh to the child from the Mother's embrace,
an Idea spacious as the starry firmament's
inescapable infinity of radiant gaze,
that fadeth only as it outpasseth mortal sight:
and this direct contact is 't with eternities,
this springtide miracle of the soul's nativity
that oft hath set philosophers adrift in dream;
which thing Christ taught, when he set up a little child
to teach his first Apostles and to accuse their pride,
saying, 'Unless ye shall receive it as a child,
ye cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.'
So thru'out all his young mental apprenticehood
the child of very simplicity, and in the grace
and beauteous attitude of infantine wonder,
is apt to absorb Ideas in primal purity,
and by the assimilation of thatt immortal food
may build immortal life; but ever with the growth
of understanding, as the sensible images
are more and more corrupt, troubled by questioning thought,
or with vainglory alloy'd, 'tis like enought the boy
in prospect of his manhood wil hav cast to th' winds
his Baptism with his Babyhood; nor might he escape
the fall of Ev'ryman, did not a second call
of nature's Love await him to confirm his Faith
or to revoke him if he is whollylapsed therefrom.
And so mighty is this second vision, which cometh
in puberty of body and adolescence of mind
that, forgetting his Mother, he calleth it 'first Love';
for it mocketh at suasion or stubbornness of heart,
as the oceantide of the omnipotent Pleasur of God,
flushing all avenues of life, and unawares
by thousandfold approach forestalling its full flood
with divination of the secret contacts of Love,--
of faintest ecstasies aslumber in Nature's calm,
like thought in a closed book, where some poet long since
sang his throbbing passion to immortal sleep-with coy
tenderness delicat as the shifting hues
that sanctify the silent dawn with wonder-gleams,
whose evanescence is the seal of their glory,
consumed in self-becoming of eternity;
til every moment as it flyeth, cryeth 'Seize!
Seize me ere I die!  I am the Life of Life.'
'Tis thus by near approach to an eternal presence
man's heart with divine furor kindled and possess'd
falleth in blind surrender; and finding therewithal
in fullest devotion the full reconcilement
betwixt his animal and spiritual desires,
such welcome hour of bliss standeth for certain pledge
of happiness perdurable: and coud he sustain
this great enthusiasm, then the unbounded promise
would keep fulfilment; since the marriage of true minds
is thatt once fabled garden, amidst of which was set
the single Tree that bore such med'cinable fruit
that if man ate thereof he should liv for ever.
Friendship is in loving rather than in being lov'd,
which is its mutual benediction and recompense;
and tho' this be, and tho' love is from lovers learn'd,
it springeth none the less from the old essence of self.
No friendless man ('twas well said) can be truly himself;
what a man looketh for in his friend and findeth,
and loving self best, loveth better than himself,
is his own better self, his live lovable idea,
flowering by expansion in the loves of his life.
And in the nobility of our earthly friendships
we hav al grades of attainment, and the best may claim
perfection of kind; and so, since ther be many bonds
other than breed (friendships of lesser motiv, found
even in the brutes) and since our politick is based
on actual association of living men, 'twil come
that the spiritual idea of Friendship, the huge
vastidity of its essence, is fritter'd away
in observation of the usual habits of men;
as happ'd with the great moralist, where his book saith
that ther can be no friendship betwixt God and man
because of their unlimited disparity.
From this dilemma of pagan thought, this poison of faith,
Man-soul made glad escape in the worship of Christ;
for his humanity is God's Personality,
and communion with him is the life of the soul.
Of which living ideas (when in the struggle of thought
harden'd by language they became symbols of faith)
Reason builded her maze, wherefrom none should escape,
wandering intent to map and learn her tortuous clews,
chanting their clerkly creed to the high-echoing stones
of their hand-fashion'd temple: but the Wind of heav'n
bloweth where it listeth, and Christ yet walketh the earth,
and talketh still as with those two disciples once
on the road to Emmaus-where they walk and are sad;
whose vision of him then was his victory over death,
thatt resurrection which all his lovers should share,
who in loving him had learn'd the Ethick of happiness;
whereby they too should come where he was ascended
to reign over men's hearts in the Kingdom of God.
Our happiest earthly comradeships hold a foretaste
of the feast of salvation and by thatt virtue in them
provoke desire beyond them to out-reach and surmount
their humanity in some superhumanity
and ultimat perfection: which, howe'ever 'tis found
or strangeley imagin'd, answereth to the need of each
and pulleth him instinctivly as to a final cause.
Thus unto all who hav found their high ideal in Christ,
Christ is to them the essence discern'd or undeiscern'd
of all their human friendships; and each lover of him
and of his beauty must be as a bud on the Vine
and hav participation in him; for Goddes love
is unescapable as nature's environment,
which if a man ignore or think to thrust it off
he is the ill-natured fool that runneth blindly on death.
This Individualism is man's true Socialism.
This is the rife Idea whose spiritual beauty
multiplieth in communion to transcendant might.
This is thatt excelent way whereon if we wil walk
all things shall be added unto us-thatt Love which inspired
the wayward Visionary in his doctrinal ode
to the three christian Graces, the Church's first hymn
and only deathless athanasian creed,--the which
'except a man believe he cannot be saved.'
This is the endearing bond whereby Christ's company
yet holdeth together on the truth of his promise
that he spake of his grat pity and trust in man's love,
'Lo, I am with you always ev'n to the end of the world.'
Truly the Soul returneth the body's loving
where it hath won it...and God so loveth the world...
and in the fellowship of the friendship of Christ
God is seen as the very self-essence of love,
Creator and mover of all as activ Lover of all,
self-express'd in not-self, mind and body, mother and child,
'twixt lover and loved, God and man: but ONE ETERNAL
in the love of Beauty and in the selfhood of Love."
71,Emotion,BeautyPoemsRealBeautyPoembyHFitzgeraldDurbin,"Some say beauty is only skin deep, and to some this may apply.
Outward appearance is not real beauty, I'll tell you the reason why.
For true beauty lies within the soul, and comes from the heart.
It comes not from what can be seen of us, but what we may impart.  True beauty is not how we may adorn ourselves, others to impress.
The true beauty of each of us, lies deep within our breast.
If we let Jesus Christ dwell in our heart, and evermore abound.
Peace, Love, and beauty that comes from the Lord, will everywhere be found."
72,Emotion,BeautyPoemsTheDefinitionOfBeautyIsPoembyEmilyDickinson,"988
The Definition of Beauty is
That Definition is none—
Of Heaven, easing Analysis,
Since Heaven and He are one."
73,Emotion,BeautyPoemsAnHymnOfHeavenlyBeautyPoembyEdmundSpenser,"Rapt with the rage of mine own ravish'd thought,
Through contemplation of those goodly sights,
And glorious images in heaven wrought,
Whose wondrous beauty, breathing sweet delights
Do kindle love in high-conceited sprights;
I fain to tell the things that I behold,
But feel my wits to fail, and tongue to fold.
Vouchsafe then, O thou most Almighty Spright,
From whom all gifts of wit and knowledge flow,
To shed into my breast some sparkling light
Of thine eternal truth, that I may show
Some little beams to mortal eyes below
Of that immortal beauty, there with thee,
Which in my weak distraughted mind I see;
That with the glory of so goodly sight
The hearts of men, which fondly here admire
Fair seeming shews, and feed on vain delight,
Transported with celestial desire
Of those fair forms, may lift themselves up higher,
And learn to love, with zealous humble duty,
Th' eternal fountain of that heavenly beauty.
Beginning then below, with th' easy view
Of this base world, subject to fleshly eye,
From thence to mount aloft, by order due,
To contemplation of th' immortal sky;
Of the soare falcon so I learn to fly,
That flags awhile her fluttering wings beneath,
Till she herself for stronger flight can breathe.
Then look, who list thy gazeful eyes to feed
With sight of that is fair, look on the frame
Of this wide universe, and therein reed
The endless kinds of creatures which by name
Thou canst not count, much less their natures aim;
All which are made with wondrous wise respect,
And all with admirable beauty deckt.
First th' earth, on adamantine pillars founded,
Amid the sea engirt with brazen bands;
Then th' air still flitting, but yet firmly bounded
On every side, with piles of flaming brands,
Never consum'd, nor quench'd with mortal hands;
And last, that mighty shining crystal wall,
Wherewith he hath encompassed this All.
By view whereof it plainly may appear,
That still as every thing doth upward tend,
And further is from earth, so still more clear
And fair it grows, till to his perfect end
Of purest beauty it at last ascend;
Air more than water, fire much more than air,
And heaven than fire, appears more pure and fair.
Look thou no further, but affix thine eye
On that bright, shiny, round, still moving mass,
The house of blessed gods, which men call sky,
All sow'd with glist'ring stars more thick than grass,
Whereof each other doth in brightness pass,
But those two most, which ruling night and day,
As king and queen, the heavens' empire sway;
And tell me then, what hast thou ever seen
That to their beauty may compared be,
Or can the sight that is most sharp and keen
Endure their captain's flaming head to see?
How much less those, much higher in degree,
And so much fairer, and much more than these,
As these are fairer than the land and seas?
For far above these heavens, which here we see,
Be others far exceeding these in light,
Not bounded, not corrupt, as these same be,
But infinite in largeness and in height,
Unmoving, uncorrupt, and spotless bright,
That need no sun t' illuminate their spheres,
But their own native light far passing theirs.
And as these heavens still by degrees arise,
Until they come to their first Mover's bound,
That in his mighty compass doth comprise,
And carry all the rest with him around;
So those likewise do by degrees redound,
And rise more fair; till they at last arrive
To the most fair, whereto they all do strive.
Fair is the heaven where happy souls have place,
In full enjoyment of felicity,
Whence they do still behold the glorious face
Of the divine eternal Majesty;
More fair is that, where those Ideas on high
Enranged be, which Plato so admired,
And pure Intelligences from God inspired.
Yet fairer is that heaven, in which do reign
The sovereign Powers and mighty Potentates,
Which in their high protections do contain
All mortal princes and imperial states;
And fairer yet, whereas the royal Seats
And heavenly Dominations are set,
From whom all earthly governance is fet.
Yet far more fair be those bright Cherubins,
Which all with golden wings are overdight,
And those eternal burning Seraphins,
Which from their faces dart out fiery light;
Yet fairer than they both, and much more bright,
Be th' Angels and Archangels, which attend
On God's own person, without rest or end.
These thus in fair each other far excelling,
As to the highest they approach more near,
Yet is that highest far beyond all telling,
Fairer than all the rest which there appear,
Though all their beauties join'd together were;
How then can mortal tongue hope to express
The image of such endless perfectness?
Cease then, my tongue, and lend unto my mind
Leave to bethink how great that beauty is,
Whose utmost parts so beautiful I find;
How much more those essential parts of his,
His truth, his love, his wisdom, and his bliss,
His grace, his doom, his mercy, and his might,
By which he lends us of himself a sight.
Those unto all he daily doth display,
And shew himself in th' image of his grace,
As in a looking-glass, through which he may
Be seen of all his creatures vile and base,
That are unable else to see his face,
His glorious face which glistereth else so bright,
That th' Angels selves cannot endure his sight.
But we, frail wights, whose sight cannot sustain
The sun's bright beams when he on us doth shine,
But that their points rebutted back again
Are dull'd, how can we see with feeble eyne
The glory of that Majesty Divine,
In sight of whom both sun and moon are dark,
Compared to his least resplendent spark?
The means, therefore, which unto us is lent
Him to behold, is on his works to look,
Which he hath made in beauty excellent,
And in the same, as in a brazen book,
To read enregister'd in every nook
His goodness, which his beauty doth declare;
For all that's good is beautiful and fair.
Thence gathering plumes of perfect speculation,
To imp the wings of thy high-flying mind,
Mount up aloft through heavenly contemplation,
From this dark world, whose damps the soul so blind,
And, like the native brood of eagles' kind,
On that bright Sun of Glory fix thine eyes,
Clear'd from gross mists of frail infirmities.
Humbled with fear and awful reverence,
Before the footstool of his majesty
Throw thyself down, with trembling innocence,
Ne dare look up with corruptible eye
On the dread face of that great Deity,
For fear, lest if he chance to look on thee,
Thou turn to nought, and quite confounded be.
But lowly fall before his mercy seat,
Close covered with the Lamb's integrity
From the just wrath of his avengeful threat
That sits upon the righteous throne on high;
His throne is built upon eternity,
More firm and durable than steel or brass,
Or the hard diamond, which them both doth pass.
His sceptre is the rod of righteousness,
With which he bruiseth all his foes to dust,
And the great Dragon strongly doth repress,
Under the rigour of his judgement just;
His seat is truth, to which the faithful trust,
From whence proceed her beams so pure and bright
That all about him sheddeth glorious light:
Light far exceeding that bright blazing spark
Which darted is from Titan's flaming head,
That with his beams enlumineth the dark
And dampish air, whereby all things are read;
Whose nature yet so much is marvelled
Of mortal wits, that it doth much amaze
The greatest wizards which thereon do gaze.
But that immortal light, which there doth shine,
Is many thousand times more bright, more clear,
More excellent, more glorious, more divine,
Through which to God all mortal actions here,
And even the thoughts of men, do plain appear;
For from th' eternal truth it doth proceed,
Through heavenly virtue which her beams do breed.
With the great glory of that wondrous light
His throne is all encompassed around,
And hid in his own brightness from the sight
Of all that look thereon with eyes unsound;
And underneath his feet are to be found
Thunder and lightning and tempestuous fire,
The instruments of his avenging ire.
There in his bosom Sapience doth sit,
The sovereign darling of the Deity,
Clad like a queen in royal robes, most fit
For so great power and peerless majesty,
And all with gems and jewels gorgeously
Adorn'd, that brighter than the stars appear,
And make her native brightness seem more clear.
And on her head a crown of purest gold
Is set, in sign of highest sovereignty;
And in her hand a sceptre she doth hold,
With which she rules the house of God on high,
And manageth the ever-moving sky,
And in the same these lower creatures all
Subjected to her power imperial.
Both heaven and earth obey unto her will,
And all the creatures which they both contain;
For of her fullness which the world doth fill
They all partake, and do in state remain
As their great Maker did at first ordain,
Through observation of her high behest,
By which they first were made, and still increast.
The fairness of her face no tongue can tell;
For she the daughters of all women's race,
And angels eke, in beauty doth excel,
Sparkled on her from God's own glorious face,
And more increas'd by her own goodly grace,
That it doth far exceed all human thought,
Ne can on earth compared be to aught.
Ne could that painter (had he lived yet)
Which pictured Venus with so curious quill,
That all posterity admired it,
Have portray'd this, for all his mast'ring skill;
Ne she herself, had she remained still,
And were as fair as fabling wits do feign,
Could once come near this beauty sovereign.
But had those wits, the wonders of their days,
Or that sweet Teian poet, which did spend
His plenteous vein in setting forth her praise,
Seen but a glimpse of this which I pretend,
How wondrously would he her face commend,
Above that idol of his feigning thought,
That all the world should with his rhymes be fraught.
How then dare I, the novice of his art,
Presume to picture so divine a wight,
Or hope t' express her least perfection's part,
Whose beauty fills the heavens with her light,
And darks the earth with shadow of her sight?
Ah, gentle Muse, thou art too weak and faint
The portrait of so heavenly hue to paint.
Let angels, which her goodly face behold
And see at will, her sovereign praises sing,
And those most sacred mysteries unfold
Of that fair love of mighty heaven's King;
Enough is me t' admire so heavenly thing,
And being thus with her huge love possest,
In th' only wonder of herself to rest.
But whoso may, thrice happy man him hold,
Of all on earth whom God so much doth grace
And lets his own beloved to behold;
For in the view of her celestial face
All joy, all bliss, all happiness, have place;
Ne aught on earth can want unto the wight
Who of herself can win the wishful sight.
For she, out of her secret treasury,
Plenty of riches forth on him will pour,
Even heavenly riches, which there hidden lie
Within the closet of her chastest bower,
Th' eternal portion of her precious dower,
Which mighty God hath given to her free,
And to all those which thereof worthy be.
None thereof worthy be, but those whom she
Vouchsafeth to her presence to receive,
And letteth them her lovely face to see,
Whereof such wondrous pleasures they conceive,
And sweet contentment, that it doth bereave
Their soul of sense, through infinite delight,
And them transport from flesh into the spright.
In which they see such admirable things,
As carries them into an ecstasy,
And hear such heavenly notes, and carollings
Of God's high praise, that fills the brazen sky;
And feel such joy and pleasure inwardly,
That maketh them all worldly cares forget,
And only think on that before them set.
Ne from thenceforth doth any fleshly sense,
Or idle thought of earthly things, remain;
But all that erst seem'd sweet seems now offence,
And all that pleased erst now seems to pain;
Their joy, their comfort, their desire, their gain,
Is fixed all on that which now they see;
All other sights but feigned shadows be.
And that fair lamp, which useth to inflame
The hearts of men with self-consuming fire
Thenceforth seems foul, and full of sinful blame;
And all that pomp to which proud minds aspire
By name of honour, and so much desire,
Seems to them baseness, and all riches dross,
And all mirth sadness, and all lucre loss.
So full their eyes are of that glorious sight,
And senses fraught with such satiety,
That in nought else on earth they can delight,
But in th' aspect of that felicity,
Which they have written in their inward eye;
On which they feed, and in their fastened mind
All happy joy and full contentment find.
Ah, then, my hungry soul, which long hast fed
On idle fancies of thy foolish thought,
And, with false beauty's flatt'ring bait misled,
Hast after vain deceitful shadows sought,
Which all are fled, and now have left thee nought
But late repentance through thy follies prief;
Ah cease to gaze on matter of thy grief:
And look at last up to that sovereign light,
From whose pure beams all perfect beauty springs,
That kindleth love in every godly sprite,
Even the love of God, which loathing brings
Of this vile world and these gay-seeming things;
With whose sweet pleasures being so possest,
Thy straying thoughts henceforth for ever rest."
74,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBeautyOfSenilityPoembyLindaOri,"Age is just a state of mind
And this we know for sure -
It isn't like some rare disease
For which there is no cure;
It creeps upon us silently
To catch us unaware
And while we worry about getting old
We're already getting there;
But there's a consolation
To this thing called getting old -
Our hair will turn to silver
And our teeth will turn to gold;
Age is just a state of mind
A case of brain and brawn -
Before we realize the body is shot
The mind will already be gone!"
75,Emotion,BeautyPoemsGodScattersBeautyPoembyWalterSavageLandor,"God scatters beauty as he scatters flowers
O'er the wide earth, and tells us all are ours.
A hundred lights in every temple burn,
And at each shrine I bend my knee in turn."
76,Emotion,BeautyPoemsTheBeautyHiddenInABeautyPoembyRahmanHenry,"It's early autumn
The Fort Worth International Airport
Waiting with her every beauty
In a cowboy country, where
The vast lone star state stands
Around there, somewhere you smiling,
My beloved!
The beauty hidden in a beauty"
77,Emotion,BeautyPoemsOBeautyPassingBeautyPoembyAlfredLordTennyson,"O beauty, passing beauty! Sweetest sweet!
How can thou let me waste my youth in sighs?
I only ask to sit beside thy feet.
Thou knowest I dare not look into thine eyes.
Might I but kiss thy hand! I dare not fold
My arms about thee--scarcely dare to speak.
And nothing seems to me so wild and bold,
As with one kiss to touch thy blessed cheek.
Methinks if I should kiss thee, no control
Within the thrilling brain could keep afloat
The subtle spirit. Even while I spoke,
The bare word ""kiss"" hath made my inner soul
To tremble like a lute string, ere the note
Hath melted in the silence that it broke."
78,Emotion,BeautyPoemsSonnetIvBrightStarOfBeautyPoembyMichaelDrayton,"Bright star of beauty, on whose eyelids sit
A thousand nymph-like and enamour'd Graces,
The Goddesses of Memory and Wit,
Which there in order take their several places;
In whose dear bosom sweet delicious Love
Lays down his quiver, which he once did bear,
Since he that blessed Paradise did prove,
And leaves his mother's lap to sport him there.
Let others strive to entertain with words;
My soul is of a braver metal made;
I hold that vile which vulgar wit affords;
In me's that faith which Time cannot invade.
Let what I praise be still made good by you;
Be you most worthy, whilst I am most true."
79,Emotion,BeautyPoemsSoulsBeautyPoembyDanteGabrielRossetti,"Under the arch of Life, where love and death,
Terror and mystery, guard her shrine, I saw
Beauty enthroned; and though her gaze struck awe,
I drew it in as simply as my breath.
Hers are the eyes which, over and beneath,
The sky and sea bend on thee,—which can draw,
By sea or sky or woman, to one law,
The allotted bondman of her palm and wreath.
This is that Lady Beauty, in whose praise
Thy voice and hand shake still,—long known to thee
By flying hair and fluttering hem,—the beat
Following her daily of thy heart and feet,
How passionately and irretrievably,
In what fond flight, how many ways and days!"
80,Emotion,BeautyPoemsTrueBeautyPoembyFrancisBeaumont,"May I find a woman fair,
And her mind as clear as air,
If her beauty go alone,
'Tis to me as if't were none.
May I find a woman rich,
And not of too high a pitch;
If that pride should cause disdain,
Tell me, lover, where's thy gain?
May I find a woman wise,
And her falseliood not disguise;
Hath she wit as she hath will,
Double arm'd she is to ill.
May I find a woman kind,
And not wavering like the wind:
How should I call that love mine,
When 'tis his, and his, and thine?
May I find a woman true,
There is Bettutv's fairest hue,
There is Beauty, Love, and Wit:
Happy he can compass it."
81,Emotion,BeautyPoemsIDiedForBeautyPoembyEmilyDickinson,"I died for beauty, but was scarce
Adjusted in the tomb,
When one who died for truth was lain
In an adjoining room.
He questioned softly why I failed?
""For beauty,"" I replied.
""And I for truth - the two are one;
We brethren are,"" he said.
And so, as kinsmen met a-night,
We talked between the rooms,
Until the moss had reached our lips,
And covered up our names."
82,Emotion,BeautyPoemsAHymnOfHeavenlyBeautyPoembyEdmundSpenser,"Rapt with the rage of mine own ravish'd thought,
Through contemplation of those goodly sights,
And glorious images in heaven wrought,
Whose wondrous beauty, breathing sweet delights
Do kindle love in high-conceited sprights;
I fain to tell the things that I behold,
But feel my wits to fail, and tongue to fold.
Vouchsafe then, O thou most Almighty Spright,
From whom all gifts of wit and knowledge flow,
To shed into my breast some sparkling light
Of thine eternal truth, that I may show
Some little beams to mortal eyes below
Of that immortal beauty, there with thee,
Which in my weak distraughted mind I see;
That with the glory of so goodly sight
The hearts of men, which fondly here admire
Fair seeming shews, and feed on vain delight,
Transported with celestial desire
Of those fair forms, may lift themselves up higher,
And learn to love, with zealous humble duty,
Th' eternal fountain of that heavenly beauty.
Beginning then below, with th' easy view
Of this base world, subject to fleshly eye,
From thence to mount aloft, by order due,
To contemplation of th' immortal sky;
Of the soare falcon so I learn to fly,
That flags awhile her fluttering wings beneath,
Till she herself for stronger flight can breathe.
Then look, who list thy gazeful eyes to feed
With sight of that is fair, look on the frame
Of this wide universe, and therein reed
The endless kinds of creatures which by name
Thou canst not count, much less their natures aim;
All which are made with wondrous wise respect,
And all with admirable beauty deckt.
First th' earth, on adamantine pillars founded,
Amid the sea engirt with brazen bands;
Then th' air still flitting, but yet firmly bounded
On every side, with piles of flaming brands,
Never consum'd, nor quench'd with mortal hands;
And last, that mighty shining crystal wall,
Wherewith he hath encompassed this All.
By view whereof it plainly may appear,
That still as every thing doth upward tend,
And further is from earth, so still more clear
And fair it grows, till to his perfect end
Of purest beauty it at last ascend;
Air more than water, fire much more than air,
And heaven than fire, appears more pure and fair.
Look thou no further, but affix thine eye
On that bright, shiny, round, still moving mass,
The house of blessed gods, which men call sky,
All sow'd with glist'ring stars more thick than grass,
Whereof each other doth in brightness pass,
But those two most, which ruling night and day,
As king and queen, the heavens' empire sway;
And tell me then, what hast thou ever seen
That to their beauty may compared be,
Or can the sight that is most sharp and keen
Endure their captain's flaming head to see?
How much less those, much higher in degree,
And so much fairer, and much more than these,
As these are fairer than the land and seas?
For far above these heavens, which here we see,
Be others far exceeding these in light,
Not bounded, not corrupt, as these same be,
But infinite in largeness and in height,
Unmoving, uncorrupt, and spotless bright,
That need no sun t' illuminate their spheres,
But their own native light far passing theirs.
And as these heavens still by degrees arise,
Until they come to their first Mover's bound,
That in his mighty compass doth comprise,
And carry all the rest with him around;
So those likewise do by degrees redound,
And rise more fair; till they at last arrive
To the most fair, whereto they all do strive.
Fair is the heaven where happy souls have place,
In full enjoyment of felicity,
Whence they do still behold the glorious face
Of the divine eternal Majesty;
More fair is that, where those Ideas on high
Enranged be, which Plato so admired,
And pure Intelligences from God inspired.
Yet fairer is that heaven, in which do reign
The sovereign Powers and mighty Potentates,
Which in their high protections do contain
All mortal princes and imperial states;
And fairer yet, whereas the royal Seats
And heavenly Dominations are set,
From whom all earthly governance is fet.
Yet far more fair be those bright Cherubins,
Which all with golden wings are overdight,
And those eternal burning Seraphins,
Which from their faces dart out fiery light;
Yet fairer than they both, and much more bright,
Be th' Angels and Archangels, which attend
On God's own person, without rest or end.
These thus in fair each other far excelling,
As to the highest they approach more near,
Yet is that highest far beyond all telling,
Fairer than all the rest which there appear,
Though all their beauties join'd together were;
How then can mortal tongue hope to express
The image of such endless perfectness?
Cease then, my tongue, and lend unto my mind
Leave to bethink how great that beauty is,
Whose utmost parts so beautiful I find;
How much more those essential parts of his,
His truth, his love, his wisdom, and his bliss,
His grace, his doom, his mercy, and his might,
By which he lends us of himself a sight.
Those unto all he daily doth display,
And shew himself in th' image of his grace,
As in a looking-glass, through which he may
Be seen of all his creatures vile and base,
That are unable else to see his face,
His glorious face which glistereth else so bright,
That th' Angels selves cannot endure his sight.
But we, frail wights, whose sight cannot sustain
The sun's bright beams when he on us doth shine,
But that their points rebutted back again
Are dull'd, how can we see with feeble eyne
The glory of that Majesty Divine,
In sight of whom both sun and moon are dark,
Compared to his least resplendent spark?
The means, therefore, which unto us is lent
Him to behold, is on his works to look,
Which he hath made in beauty excellent,
And in the same, as in a brazen book,
To read enregister'd in every nook
His goodness, which his beauty doth declare;
For all that's good is beautiful and fair.
Thence gathering plumes of perfect speculation,
To imp the wings of thy high-flying mind,
Mount up aloft through heavenly contemplation,
From this dark world, whose damps the soul so blind,
And, like the native brood of eagles' kind,
On that bright Sun of Glory fix thine eyes,
Clear'd from gross mists of frail infirmities.
Humbled with fear and awful reverence,
Before the footstool of his majesty
Throw thyself down, with trembling innocence,
Ne dare look up with corruptible eye
On the dread face of that great Deity,
For fear, lest if he chance to look on thee,
Thou turn to nought, and quite confounded be.
But lowly fall before his mercy seat,
Close covered with the Lamb's integrity
From the just wrath of his avengeful threat
That sits upon the righteous throne on high;
His throne is built upon eternity,
More firm and durable than steel or brass,
Or the hard diamond, which them both doth pass.
His sceptre is the rod of righteousness,
With which he bruiseth all his foes to dust,
And the great Dragon strongly doth repress,
Under the rigour of his judgement just;
His seat is truth, to which the faithful trust,
From whence proceed her beams so pure and bright
That all about him sheddeth glorious light:
Light far exceeding that bright blazing spark
Which darted is from Titan's flaming head,
That with his beams enlumineth the dark
And dampish air, whereby all things are read;
Whose nature yet so much is marvelled
Of mortal wits, that it doth much amaze
The greatest wizards which thereon do gaze.
But that immortal light, which there doth shine,
Is many thousand times more bright, more clear,
More excellent, more glorious, more divine,
Through which to God all mortal actions here,
And even the thoughts of men, do plain appear;
For from th' eternal truth it doth proceed,
Through heavenly virtue which her beams do breed.
With the great glory of that wondrous light
His throne is all encompassed around,
And hid in his own brightness from the sight
Of all that look thereon with eyes unsound;
And underneath his feet are to be found
Thunder and lightning and tempestuous fire,
The instruments of his avenging ire.
There in his bosom Sapience doth sit,
The sovereign darling of the Deity,
Clad like a queen in royal robes, most fit
For so great power and peerless majesty,
And all with gems and jewels gorgeously
Adorn'd, that brighter than the stars appear,
And make her native brightness seem more clear.
And on her head a crown of purest gold
Is set, in sign of highest sovereignty;
And in her hand a sceptre she doth hold,
With which she rules the house of God on high,
And manageth the ever-moving sky,
And in the same these lower creatures all
Subjected to her power imperial.

83,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBeautyInNaturePoembyArtiChopra,"Theres a poem in every flower,
a sonnet in every tree,
a tale in every lifetime
its just for you to see...
theres a lyric in every brook
as it rushes over rocks,
theres  an ode in every nuance,
as loves wonder unlocks,
theres rhythm in every sound,
every beating of a heart,
theres poetry in every union
and every couple who are apart
and just as there is wonder
in every new life created
there is sadness and regret,
for the unsaid and unfeted
just listen for the music
that your ears cannot hear,
just strain yourself for the melody
thats so far and yet so near
the wonder of the creator,
the magic of the divine

84,Emotion,BeautyPoemsAmorettiIiiTheSovereignBeautyPoembyEdmundSpenser,"The sovereign beauty which I do admire,
Witness the world how worthy to be praised:
The light whereof hath kindled heavenly fire
In my frail spirit, by her from baseness raised;
That being now with her huge brightness dazed,
Base thing I can no more endure to view;
But looking still on her, I stand amazed
At wondrous sight of so celestial hue.
So when my tongue would speak her praises due,
It stopped is with thought's astonishment:
And when my pen would write her titles true,
It ravish'd is with fancy's wonderment:
Yet in my heart I then both speak and write
The wonder that my wit cannot endite."
85,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBeautyPoembyWilfredOwen,"The beautiful, the fair, the elegant,
Is that which pleases us, says Kant,
Without a thought of interest or advantage.
I used to watch men when they spoke of beauty
And measure their enthusiasm. One
An old man, seeing a ()  setting sun,
Praised it ()  a certain sense of duty
To the calm evening and his time of life.
I know another man that never says a Beauty
But of a horse; ()
Men seldom speak of beauty, beauty as such,
Not even lovers think about it much.
Women of course consider it for hours
In mirrors; ()
A shrapnel ball -
Just where the wet skin glistened when he swam -
Like a fully-opened sea-anemone.
We both said 'What a beauty! What a beauty, lad'
I knew that in that flower he saw a hope
Of living on, and seeing again the roses of his home.
Beauty is that which pleases and delights,
Not bringing personal advantage - Kant.
But later on I heard
A canker worked into that crimson flower
And that he sank with it
And laid it with the anemones off Dover."
86,Emotion,BeautyPoemsHeRemembersForgottenBeautyPoembyWilliamButlerYeats,"When my arms wrap you round I press
My heart upon the loveliness
That has long faded from the world;
The jewelled crowns that kings have hurled
In shadowy pools, when armies fled;
The love-tales wrought with silken thread
By dreaming ladies upon cloth
That has made fat the murderous moth;
The roses that of old time were
Woven by ladies in their hair,
The dew-cold lilies ladies bore
Through many a sacred corridor
Where such grey clouds of incense rose
That only God's eyes did not close:
For that pale breast and lingering hand
Come from a more dream-heavy land,
A more dream-heavy hour than this;
And when you sigh from kiss to kiss
I hear white Beauty sighing, too,
For hours when all must fade like dew.
But flame on flame, and deep on deep,
Throne over throne where in half sleep,
Their swords upon their iron knees,
Brood her high lonely mysteries."
87,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBeautyAndBeautyPoembyRupertBrooke,"When Beauty and Beauty meet
All naked, fair to fair,
The earth is crying-sweet,
And scattering-bright the air,
Eddying, dizzying, closing round,
With soft and drunken laughter;
Veiling all that may befall
After -- after --
Where Beauty and Beauty met,
Earth's still a-tremble there,
And winds are scented yet,
And memory-soft the air,
Bosoming, folding glints of light,
And shreds of shadowy laughter;
Not the tears that fill the years
After -- after --"
88,Emotion,BeautyPoemsAPhilosophyOfBeautyPoembyUriahHamilton,"These evil days require you to grit your teeth in misery to survive,
But you have to realize life is more
Than staying alive:
You have to create magical kindness in the heart,
Follow the skyscraper skyline
While in ecstasy pursuing art;
But still, I grow weary of cops kicking the homeless
Down heartless streets,
I’ll have to go out west and live in the sand,
Dance at dusk upon the beach,
Later, on midnight dunes I’ll sleep.
Living out your Divinity involves a philosophy of beauty
And refusing to hurt anyone."

Of humanity in decline."

91,Emotion,BeautyPoemsOdeToBeautyPoembyMaryDarbyRobinson,"EXULTING BEAUTY,­phantom of an hour,
Whose magic spells enchain the heart,
Ah! what avails thy fascinating pow'r,
Thy thrilling smile, thy witching art?
Thy lip, where balmy nectar glows;
Thy cheek, where round the damask rose
A thousand nameless Graces move,
Thy mildly speaking azure eyes,
Thy golden hair, where cunning Love
In many a mazy ringlet lies?
Soon as thy radiant form is seen,
Thy native blush, thy timid mien,
Thy hour is past! thy charms are vain!
ILL-NATURE haunts thee with her sallow train,
Mean JEALOUSY deceives thy list'ning ear,
And SLANDER stains thy cheek with many a bitter tear.
In calm retirement form'd to dwell,
NATURE, thy handmaid fair and kind,
For thee, a beauteous garland twin'd;
The vale-nurs'd Lily's downcast bell
Thy modest mien display'd,
The snow-drop, April's meekest child,
With myrtle blossoms undefil'd,
Thy mild and spotless mind pourtray'd;
Dear blushing maid, of cottage birth,
'Twas thine, o'er dewy meads to stray,
While sparkling health, and frolic mirth
Led on thy laughing Day.
Lur'd by the babbling tongue of FAME,
Too soon, insidious FLATT'RY came;
Flush'd VANITY her footsteps led,
To charm thee from thy blest repose,
While Fashion twin'd about thy head
A wreath of wounding woes;
See Dissipation smoothly glide,
Cold Apathy, and puny Pride,
Capricious Fortune, dull, and blind,
O'er splendid Folly throws her veil,
While Envy's meagre tribe assail
Thy gentle form, and spotless mind.
Their spells prevail! no more those eyes
Shoot undulating fires;
On thy wan cheek, the young rose dies,
Thy lip's deep tint expires;
Dark Melancholy chills thy mind;
Thy silent tear reveals thy woe;
TIME strews with thorns thy mazy way,
Where'er thy giddy footsteps stray,
Thy thoughtless heart is doom'd to find
An unrelenting foe.
'Tis thus, the infant Forest flow'r
Bespangled o'er with glitt'ring dew,
At breezy morn's refreshing hour,
Glows with pure tints of varying hue,
Beneath an aged oak's wide spreading shade,
Where no rude winds, or beating storms invade.
Transplanted from its lonely bed,
No more it scatters perfumes round,
No more it rears its gentle head,
Or brightly paints the mossy ground;
For ah! the beauteous bud, too soon,
Scorch'd by the burning eye of day;
Shrinks from the sultry glare of noon,
Droops its enamell'd brow, and blushing, dies away."
92,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBadDayAtTheBeautySalonPoembyMaggieEstep,"I was a 20 year old unemployed receptionist with dyed orange dreadlocks sprouting out of my skull. I needed a job, but first, I needed a haircut.
So I head for this beauty salon on Avenue B.
I'm gonna get a hairdo.
I'm gonna look just like those hot Spanish haircut models, become brown and bodacious, grow some 7 inch fingernails painted bitch red and rake them down the chalkboard of the job market's soul.
So I go in the beauty salon.
This beautiful Puerto Rican girl in tight white spandex and a push-up bra sits me down and starts chopping my hair:
""Girlfriend,"" she says, ""what the hell you got growing outta your head there, what is that, hair implants? Yuck, you want me to touch that shit, whadya got in there, sandwiches?""
I just go: ""I'm sorry.""
She starts snipping my carefully cultivated Johnny Lydon post-Pistols hairdo. My foul little dreadlocks are flying around all over the place but I'm not looking in the mirror cause I just don't want to know.
""So what's your name anyway?"" My stylist demands then.
""Uh, Maggie.""
""Maggie? Well, that's an okay name, but my name is Suzy.""
""Yeah, so?""
""Yeah so it ain't just Suzy S.U.Z.Y, I spell it S.U.Z.E.E, the extra ""e"" is for extra Suzee.""
I nod emphatically.
Suzee tells me when she's not busy chopping hair, she works as an exotic dancer at night to support her boyfriend named Rocco. Suzee loves Rocco, she loves him so much she's got her eyes closed as she describes him:
""6 foot 2, 193 pounds and, girlfriend, his arms so big and long they wrap around me twice like I'm a little Suzee sandwich.""
Little Suzee Sandwich is rapt, she blindly snips and clips at my poor punk head. She snips and clips and snips and clips, she pauses, I look in the mirror: ""Holy shit, I'm bald.""
""Holy shit, baby, you're bald."" Suzee says, finally opening her eyes and then gasping.
All I've got left is little post-nuke clumps of orange fuzz. And I'll never get a receptionist job now.
But Suzy waves her manicured finger in my face: ""Don't you worry, baby, I'm gonna get you a job at the dancing club.""
""What?""
"" ;Baby, let me tell you, the boys are gonna like a bald go go dancer.""
That said, she whips out some clippers, shaves my head smooth and insists I'm gonna love getting naked for a living.
None of this sounds like my idea of a good time, but I'm broke and I'm bald so I go home and get my best panties. Suzee lends me some 6 inch pumps, paints my lips bright red, and gives me 7 shots of Jack Daniels to relax me.
8pm that night I take the stage.
I'm bald,
I'm drunk,
and by god,
I'm naked.
HOLY SHIT I'M NAKED IN A ROOM FULL OF STRANGERS THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE RECURRING NIGHTMARES WE ALL HAVE ABOUT BEING BUTT NAKED IN PUBLIC, I AM NAKED, I DON'T KNOW THESE PEOPLE, THIS REALLY SUCKS.
A few guys feel sorry for me and risk getting their hands bitten off by sticking dollars in my garter belt. My disheveled pubic hairs stand at full attention, ready to poke the guys' eyes out if they get too close.
Then I notice this bald guy in the audience, I've got a new empathy for bald people, I figure maybe it works both ways, maybe this guy will stick 10 bucks in my garter.
I saunter over.
I'm teetering around unrhythmically, I'm the surliest, unsexiest dancer that ever go-go across this hemisphere. The bald guy looks down into his beer, he'd much rather look at that than at my pubic mound which has now formed into one vicious spike so it looks like I've got a unicorn in my crotch.
I stand there weaving through the air.
The strobe light is illuminating my pubic unicorn. Madonna's song Borderline is pumping through the club's speaker system for the 5th time tonight: ""BORDERLINE BORDERLINE BORDERLINE/LOVE ME TIL I JUST CAN'T SEE."" And suddenly, I start to wonder: What does that mean anyway?
""LOVE ME TIL I JUST CAN'T SEE""
What?
Screw me so much my eyes pop out, I go blind, end up walking down 2nd Avenue crazy, horny, naked and blind? What?
There's a glitch in the tape and it starts to skip.
""Borderl...ooop.....Borderl.... ooop...Borderlin.....ooop""
I stumble and twist my ankle. My g-string rides between my buttcheeks making me twitch with pain. My head starts spinning, my knees wobble, I go down on all fours and puke all over the bald guy's lap.
So there I am. Butt naked on all fours. But before I have time to regain my composure, the strip club manager comes over, points his smarmy strip club manager finger at me and goes:
""You're bald, you're drunk, you can't dance and you're fired.""
I stand up.
""Oh yeah, well you stink like a sneaker, pal."" I peel off one of my pumps and throw it in the direction of his fat head then I get the hell out of there.
A few days later I run into Suzee on Avenue A. Turns out she got fired for getting me a job there in the first place. But she was completely undaunted, she dragged me up to this wig store on 14th Street, bought me a mouse brown shag wig, then got us both telemarketing jobs on Wall Street.
And I never went to a beauty salon again."
93,Emotion,BeautyPoemsPiedBeautyPoembyGerardManleyHopkins,"Glory be to God for dappled things --

94,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBeautyClearAndFairPoembyJohnFletcher,"BEAUTY clear and fair,
Where the air
Rather like a perfume dwells;
Where the violet and the rose
Their blue veins and blush disclose,
And come to honour nothing else:
Where to live near
And planted there
Is to live, and still live new;
Where to gain a favour is
More than light, perpetual bliss--
Make me live by serving you!
Dear, again back recall
To this light,
A stranger to himself and all!
Both the wonder and the story
Shall be yours, and eke the glory;
I am your servant, and your thrall."
95,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBeautyArisePoembyThomasDekker,"Beauty arise, show forth thy glorious shining,
Thine eyes feed love, for them he standeth pining ;
Honor and youth attend to do their duty
To thee, their only sovereign, Beauty.
Beauty arise, whilst we, thy servants, sing
Io to Hymen, wedlock's jocund king.
Io to Hymen, Io, Io, sing ;
Of wedlock, love, and youth is Hymen king.
Beauty arise, Beauty arise, thy glorious lights display,
Whilst we sing Io, glad to see this day.
Io, Io, to Hymen, Io, Io, sing ;
Of wedlock, love, and youth is Hymen king."
96,Emotion,BeautyPoemsSleepingBeautyPoembyGordonWhittaker,"She lay safe in my arms
her eyes closed  in sleep,
I gazed  at her beautiful features
to me they are certainly unique.
Her lovely long eye lashes,
her complexion  like a rose,
and that irresistible cute shaped nose.
I bent over to kiss her soft velvet like skin,
the aroma that exuded from her body made
me feel really good within.
I am  a lucky guy to have such a
beauty  lying by my side.
I drifted of to sleep feeling a certain amount of pride.
I was awakened in the night by an almighty yell,
it was my beauty crying like hell.
I jumped up startled, and looked around
And found her dummy lying on the ground."
97,Emotion,BeautyPoemsIDiedForBeautyButWasScarcePoembyEmilyDickinson,"I died for beauty but was scarce
Adjusted in the tomb,
When one who died for truth was lain
In an adjoining room.
He questioned softly why I failed?
'For beauty,' I replied.
'And I for truth,--the two are one;
We brethren are,' he said.
And so, as kinsmen met a night,
We talked between the rooms,
Until the moss had reached our lips,
And covered up our names."
98,Emotion,BeautyPoemsBeautynotesForAnUnfinishedPoemPoembyWilfredOwen,"The beautiful, the fair, the elegant,
Is that which pleases us, says Kant,
Without a thought of interest or advantage.
I used to watch men when they spoke of beauty
And measure their enthusiasm. One
An old man, seeing a ( ) setting sun,
Praised it ( ) a certain sense of duty
To the calm evening and his time of life.
I know another man that never says a Beauty
But of a horse; ( )
Men seldom speak of beauty, beauty as such,
Not even lovers think about it much.
Women of course consider it for hours
In mirrors; ( )
A shrapnel ball -
Just where the wet skin glistened when he swam -
Like a fully-opened sea-anemone.
We both said 'What a beauty! What a beauty, lad'
I knew that in that flower he saw a hope
Of living on, and seeing again the roses of his home.
Beauty is that which pleases and delights,
Not bringing personal advantage - Kant.
But later on I heard
A canker worked into that crimson flower
And that he sank with it
And laid it with the anemones off Dover."
99,Emotion,BeautyPoemsSonnet54OHowMuchMoreDothBeautyBeauteousSeemPoembyWilliamShakespeare,"O, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!
The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
For that sweet odour which doth in it live.
The canker blooms have full as deep a dye
As the perfumèd tincture of the roses,
Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly
When summer's breath their maskèd buds discloses;
But, for their virtue only is their show,
They live unwooed and unrespected fade,
Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;
Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made.
And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
When that shall vade, by verse distills your truth."
100,Emotion,FreedomPoemsTheOnlyTrueFreedomIsFreedomFromTheHeartsDesiresPoembyNomadGoggs,"Travel light a friend once said to me,
'Yeah right' i thought with my big screen TV,
but over the years I've changed my view,
now i know there are very few things truly essential to you.
Each move I disposed of more sentimental tat,
it became easier as i realised, don't need this, don't need that.
Then one summer's day i was forced from my home,
loads more had to go, into storage went some,
Now i live in a hostel with limited bits,
eight months on, the stored, do i need it?
With every possession also comes responsibility,
burglars shot to save a five pound DVD,
so now I'm working my way to cut off the slack,
i want to end up with just a rucksack,
then I'll have freedom, true freedom to roam,
wherever i lay, that'll be my home."
101,Emotion,FreedomPoemsFreedomPoembyKevinDeckert,"What is freedom? Nobody knows.
What do I think is freedom?
Freedom is,
when you can do what you like
Without ever hurting somebody
Freedom is,
when you are healthy,
Not trammelled in your bed
Freedom is,
when you are in free charge of your time
And not dominated by a watch
Freedom is,
when you can say what you think
As long as it doesn’t hurt somebody else
Freedom is,
when you can make a mistake
Without getting immediately punished for it
Freedom is,
when you can go and get milk
Whenever you want some
Freedom is,
The one thing we all want to have,
The one thing that none of us really has,
The one thing each of us defines different,
The one thing we will never have………
Freedom is…………a dream"
102,Emotion,FreedomPoemsIWantMyFreedomBackPoembyNadaliaBagratuni,"I want my freedom back,
This can't be right,
I'm a democrat!
I was supportive of human and civil rights,
I always thought that the government would take care of me,
Cradle to grave,
Yes sir re!
Now, as I get older,
I can truly see,
Freedom for some gives us less liberty,
I guess I traded in freedom from decisions,
For government dependency.
As a rule I thought I was getting a deal,
Now they aren't through!
The government controls every phase of my life,
How much get for unemployment,
Food Stamps,
And what I pay in rent.
My solution to this problem
Is as simple as can be,
Do as I did,
But do as I should have done,
Save,
Invest,
Put back into our great land,
Travel, Talk, get out and walk,
Meet your neighbors,
But most of all ask questions,
When it comes to the selection
Of people who represent us,
Don't vote for the promises of an election,
Vote instead for self-development,
Vote to restore or land to the home of the free
Once again.
Free from government,
Free from fear,
Free from big brother's ear,
Because if we don't
It won't be a country anymore,
It would be just one big joke!"
103,Emotion,FreedomPoemsBorrowedFreedomPoembyCathleenHodgkinson,"For E.D. who will never understand the gift he gave me.
I wear a silver bracelet on my wrist with its native american facade and I am reminded of a commended freedom and of peaceful spirituality.
Things that are not easy for me to acquire in my world, but easily in a world of others.
The bracelet does not belong to me, but I can feel his energy channeled through it and it warms me.
Between his life and mine, even though so different yet the same, the meaning of the bracelet has taken a life of it's own.
I am compelled to wear it, in rebellion, shedding all constrictions and conformities of who I am expected to be.
My heart, my body are consumed with carefree rapture at this newly found concept.
To dance barefoot on the grass, in my favorite faded blue jeans under the moonlight and stars,
with nothing but the feeling of simply borrowed freedom.

Endeavoured to ally while bomb descends
Each day as Fate played out the game that year.

For sustenance upon the first which lends
Real substance sends the others, signal clear.
One pushed without the other’s insincere,

then I have earned my wings.
I finally have faced my past...
even the dark and evil things.
I don't need your forgiveness
or your patronizing smile.
I know that I must do this...
I've known it for awhile.
A part of me was frozen
yet now began the thaw.
I'll show you I will make it...
just stand and watch in awe.
There's nothing I can't conquer
no hill that is too steep.
I'll prove I'm a survivor...
that's a promise I will keep.

I finally have faced my past...

Freedom to feel the touch of another man

Freedom to cry without any sorrow......
Freedom to walk with out trials and

Freedom to be along and think

Freedom to start a new life feel with love

107,Emotion,FreedomPoemsFreedomOnTheWallabyPoembyHenryLawson,"Australia's a big country
An' Freedom's humping bluey,
An' Freedom's on the wallaby
Oh! don't you hear 'er cooey?
She's just begun to boomerang,
She'll knock the tyrants silly,
She's goin' to light another fire
And boil another billy.
Our fathers toiled for bitter bread
While loafers thrived beside 'em,
But food to eat and clothes to wear,
Their native land denied 'em.
An' so they left their native land
In spite of their devotion,
An' so they came, or if they stole,
Were sent across the ocean.
Then Freedom couldn't stand the glare
O' Royalty's regalia,
She left the loafers where they were,
An' came out to Australia.
But now across the mighty main
The chains have come ter bind her –
She little thought to see again
The wrongs she left behind her.
Our parents toil'd to make a home –
Hard grubbin 'twas an' clearin' –
They wasn't crowded much with lords
When they was pioneering.
But now that we have made the land
A garden full of promise,
Old Greed must crook 'is dirty hand
And come ter take it from us.
So we must fly a rebel flag,
As others did before us,
And we must sing a rebel song
And join in rebel chorus.
We'll make the tyrants feel the sting
O' those that they would throttle;
They needn't say the fault is ours
If blood should stain the wattle!"
108,Emotion,FreedomPoemsTotalFreedomPoembySadiqullahKhan,"In absolute oblivion
With nature and the forces of existence
Into play
Thousands years of history
Written
Some relics and the forgotten one
Gods word or the wise mans talk
Deriving meaning from the stars
Sun and the moon
Goddesses and deities
The great abstraction
In the realm of thought
Freedom remains the desire
Freedom from the bonds of the humanity
Freedom from all wants
Freedom from the will of others
Imposed or perpetuated
Freedom from ideas
In the name of social consciousness
In the collective realm of the society
Of life and death
Life in community
A dream sought after
The breaking of shackles
Of ideas and the iron chain
The evolutionist’s theory of having attained modernity
The matrix of life stuck between falsehood and reality
With great illusions
Get into the realm of total freedom
Away from the connections and strings
Whose other ends are controlled in places distant
Out from the mischief of the fate defined as luck
Make death the ultimate inspiration
Whirling into circles for the last freedom
That too is another thread of making the other being
As a final destiny of union
Unite with thyself
Leave alone all the philosophies and doctrines
Religions and beliefs
Hold the wine cup of total freedom
All alone
Without any god or fate
Discover for thyself
The ultimate truth
Enter total freedom
From self to self
Leave the saki
Drunk with the wine of total freedom
Declare it to the world
For the god to listen
For the wise to ponder
Let the angels sing into your ears
Let the beauties of paradise
Dance in front of you
In
Total freedom"

on every level inside you

absolutely marvelous God's freedom child
full of happiness, prosperity and gladness
full of good or bad experience
You want to have all of them.
Take them
take them all.
Such an easy way to take goodness and gladness
much easier than to take evil and harm
much faster, delicate and without end.
You are freedom.
You are a mind of goodness, knowledge, experience, wonderful feelings
independence and render.
Discover yourself, give yourself
give your freedom to others all over the world.
Be freedom."

Freedom...
No more questions in my mind,

My spirit breaks away
Beyond this wounded,
Earthy land.
And so I pause,
I soar in feathery weight
Happiness within reach
From the sapphire cottony sky.
Elated I sigh...
Freedom...Ah...Freedom
I hold you in my heart
As I await once more...
To see life
Through a cynic's eye."

beneath the cradle of heaven's stars,
the tall grass gently caresses
your ankles.
With the hand,
that is bound by no chains,
And the eyes,
that see the heavens the skies behold.
Neither the cloud,
that flows in a rhythmic pattern
Nor the bird
who is set off course by another.
You are the wind,
You are the one,
to control your own fate,
because you are free."

On corridor of liberty,
Where man's dream was once met,
And again, man's wound is abolished.
There are no restrictions to gain,
Less I am confined, prisoned,
For I am accorded human respect
That was taken from my old folks.
We let you to levitate, with our gratitude
For your adamant spirits emancipated us,
And let those lost, redeem their virtues
For that is all they needed.
Mandela, Sisulu and Tambo
Punished for our welfare,
Salute, we salute them all,
For their dreams are quenched.
The puzzle mat is well combined
People are of colorless skin
And of same objectives, embracing this land
South African, Mzansi Africa
Enjoy the silent communication with the nation
Enjoy the juices of Mzansi’s vine yard.
On this freedom day
We join hands and shield liberation,
We instill love together,
Let the wings of the dove reign."

In my brain.. I keep the words
For every thing serious and real
The words that could change my life
In my heart.. I keep the words that
Describe me when I’m lonely,
When I’m happy or sad,
When I’m in love or broken
In my body.. I keep the words
For my health, physics and sex
In my soul.. I keep the words that
I can give to god
And thank him for every thing he gave me
Unfortunately I cant use any of those words! ?
Because in the last tow years
I have lost the word “freedom” from my dictionary
It had been captured by the dearest to me..
My freedom is locked in a big cage, full of doors
I’ve tried to free my freedom
But non of the doors was opening
I wanted to tell them release my freedom
But I just couldn’t say anything! !
I’m a prisoner because I lost my word “freedom”
I’m struggling and fighting inside of me to return my freedom
I’m in a war
Looking in silence and preying to gad! !

Every night I shed tears
But no one can hear me

'Freedom is never free.'
I know that-
More than most realize.
Freedom cost us more
Than we should have to give.
Freedom cost us blood.
It cost us the lives
Of our fathers,
Our sons,
Our brothers.
But while freedom is never free,
Remember-
It has been bought at great price,
And so is a thing of great value.
We must defend it,
From those who would take it away.
The defense of our freedoms
Will cost us-
More than we wish to pay.
But we must pay, to defend,
For if we try to make freedom free,
We forget-
True freedom is never free."

118,Emotion,FreedomPoemsFreedomOfChoicePoembyLindaOri,"God's love is unconditional
It is not bound by strings,
He does not give the bird a voice
Then tell it what to sing;
He does not give us wings to fly
Then tell  us where to go,
He does not give each man a mind
Then tell him what to know;
Life is an experience -
Each man will choose his way,
And if he makes wrong choices
They'll come back to him one day,
But still he learns the lesson,
Be it difficult or not -
God does not tell us what to learn
Nor dictate how it's taught."
119,Emotion,FreedomPoemsFreedomPoembyRexIslam,"Freedom is not an object
to be purchased from the shops,
it’s not like the giving of
one or two kilo’s of freedom chaps!
It’s what that thrives on the wings
of bees, butterflies or the dragonflies
that dances with the summer waft,
over the blazing,
flabby bunches of the lusty grain.
It’s the slides
with a hundred curves
over the gleeful tenants.
It’s the wintry morn-mist that glides
over the emerald vale,
the gush of sweet juice that pours
out of the date-palm;
the shivering, frozen puff
that cracks the meager bones;
or the fire that digs out of the mound
of straw and woods.
It’s the opening buds
with the touch of the first raindrops,
the virgin flower that flourish
with the stroke of dawn;
the menacing tempest
that bluster the roofs and roots;
the deluge that wipes the crops,
shifts with disastrous famine.
It’s the voice out of silence;
unshaped, immeasurable, left unheard,
kept untamed in the bosom
of every born free soul."

121,Emotion,FreedomPoemsFreedomPoembySnéhaSoni,"Freedom, that everyone craves for
Freedom of speech; deeds; religion; thoughts,
desires; dreams; love & expression
Where does actually this feedom exist?
What is the degree of this freedom?
People say each man is born with freedom and equality
But is it a practical truth?
If it is so why do we still crave for it?
Why do we see dissatisfaction and disappointments?
Freedom is not something that we need to find from somewhere
but, is something within ourselves
It doesnt exist in any legal or religious laws,
but lies within us
Is not being what people want us to be
Is what we want ourselves to be
Its not making others fulfill our dreams,
but letting others fulfill their dreams
It is one's own acceptance of being oneself
and resistance of letting others being themselves."
122,Emotion,FreedomPoemsTheDreamOfFreedomPoembyOwenSuffolk,"'Twas night, and the moonbeams palely fell
On the gloomy walls of a cheerless cell,
Where a captive sought a brief repose
From the bitter pangs of his waking woes.
O'er the dark blue waves the mighty deep
His spirit roamed in the dream of sleep,
To each well-loved spot of his native shore,
Where joyous he roved in the days of yore.
But o'er each scene a shadow threw
A gloom that never used to be,
All seemed so real, yet so untrue
To things once dear to memory.
The hill-side seemed a prison wall
That, grimly frowning, pained the eye;
The old oak-tree, with branches tall,
Looked like a gibbet 'gainst the sky.
Each face familiar once seemed now
A gaoler-face with a stony stare
A mark was set on each fair brow,
And in each voice were tones of care.
Thus mingled in the dreamer's brain
The present with the olden time,
Life's pleasant things with those of pain
And guiltless days with days of crime.
On, on in dream by lofty hill,
Through forest and o'er stormy wave,
He wandered; but he only still
Beheld a world of fettered slaves.
He saw a king surnamed the Great,
Who ruled the nations by his nod;
To billions his one word was fate -
He was a kind of demi-god.
He sat upon a lofty throne
A monarch, with a monarch's mien,
Earth's fairest forms were all his own,
And untold wealth was his I ween.
In the battlfield his arm was might
And his kingly heart was firm and brave;
But he knew not the charm of freedom's light.
For he was ambition's willing slave.
Then he turned from the monarch's throne to gaze
On a lonely cot in a peaceful dell,
Which lit by the sun's departing rays,
Seemed a home of bliss where no woe could dwell.
At the cottage door, with locks of white,
An old man gazed on the western sky,
And watched the sun's declining light
As it slowely sank from his haggard eye.
Alas! His spirit even there,
Where all around was bright and fair,
Was firmly bound to each crime-stained hour
By vivid mem'ry's haunting power,
While conscience o'er the sea of time
A lurid shade of darkness cast,
And conjured up the deeds of crime
That chained him to a guilty past.
In the captive's dream of fancy wild,
He looked no more on the man of care;
His gaze was fixed on a beauteous child
Who knelt at its mother's feet in prayer.
Its little hands were clasped - its eyes
Uplifted were to paradise;
Its simple words of faith and love
Were registered in heaven above;
Recorded there with angels' tears
As they wept o'er the hopes the mother built,
For they looked through the vista of the coming years,
And saw it fettered to future guilt.
And next he saw a youthful pair,
A gallant youth and maiden fair,
Reclining in a vine wreathed bower
At evening's calm and gentle hour.
Their words were such as lovers speak
When none are near; and on her cheek
The blushes deepened while he knelt
And poured out all his passion felt,
And not in vain. Then surely they
Were happy as a summer-day?
Ah! No, for happiness is twin
To purity of life and soul;
And those who only love in sin
Must wander widely from the goal.
The flowers that scented the ev'ing air,
The stars that gleamed from their home above,
Shed pitying tears for the guilty pair,
For they were the slaves of unholy love.
Then he turned from the things of earth to gaze
On the regions of immortality,
Where seraphs chanted their songs of praise,
And every tongue was tuned in joy,
Where countless thousands, clothed in white,
To angel-harps sang 'We are free,
And all who enter these realms of light
From sin and sorrow shall be as we.
Here freedom's waters bright and fair,
Flow undimmed by a single care;
And all who taste of the crystal tide
Of the stream of life that for ever flows,
Can never again be to sin allied,
And is free forever from earthly woes.'
'Twas now the drear-toned prison bell
Loud-echoed through the captive's cell.
He rose - the vision of the night
Again was present to his sight.
He knelt -with fervency he prayed;
Through faith in Christ, his sins forgiven,
The narrow boundary of the grave
Should be the vestibule of Heaven,
Where, disenthralled from all below,
He'd dwell beyond the starry sky,
Free from the pains of earthly woe,
In never-ending liberty!"
123,Emotion,FreedomPoemsFreedomToDoPoembynatalievail,"So many people around me.
The ones I love and the ones I hate.
I have the freedom.
I have the freedom to love.
I have the freedome to hate.
The freedom to care.
The freedom to concern
The freedom to worry
The freedom to be hurt
The freedom to be sad
The freedom to be happy
The freedom to say what i want to say.
All of these freedoms i have.
All of these feelings i have.
You could do anything with your freedom.
Let the chains break.
Spread your wings
And fly away.
Don't let anyone get you down.
Make sure you use your freedoms correctly
You use your feelings and freedoms to make friends and the right choices.
Understand your freedoms and feelings.
We have the freedom to do what our hearts yearn to do."
124,Emotion,FreedomPoemsFreedomPoembytybohls,"To all our Soldiers past and present, God Bless
Glory to the American Flag, long may she wave
So many have been covered with her when they've
gone to their grave
So many of us have taken for granted that our
freedom will always be
We tend to forget those who have kept that
right for you and for me
A Soldier will stand and fight all night to
keep us from harm
While some of us sit at home and refuse to
lift an arm
Some sit around and complain all day how
wrong this war must be
While a Soldier pushes that aside to continue
to fight for you and me
Some sit around and complain about the food
their going to eat
While a Soldier works straight through
hungry and weary on his feet
While you sit around and complain about what
you have or where you live
Remember what a Soldier somewhere for you is
about to give
A Soldier stands tall and proud and ready for
the fight
We must stand strong behind them through
their hard and arduous plight
Lee Greenwood said it best 'The Flag still
stands for Freedom and they can't take that away'
So give Thanks to our Soldiers out there each
and every day"
125,Emotion,FreedomPoemsFreedomXivPoembyKhalilGibran,"And an orator said, ""Speak to us of Freedom.""
And he answered:
At the city gate and by your fireside I have seen you prostrate yourself and worship your own freedom,
Even as slaves humble themselves before a tyrant and praise him though he slays them.
Ay, in the grove of the temple and in the shadow of the citadel I have seen the freest among you wear their freedom as a yoke and a handcuff.
And my heart bled within me; for you can only be free when even the desire of seeking freedom becomes a harness to you, and when you cease to speak of freedom as a goal and a fulfillment.
You shall be free indeed when your days are not without a care nor your nights without a want and a grief,
But rather when these things girdle your life and yet you rise above them naked and unbound.
And how shall you rise beyond your days and nights unless you break the chains which you at the dawn of your understanding have fastened around your noon hour?
In truth that which you call freedom is the strongest of these chains, though its links glitter in the sun and dazzle the eyes.
And what is it but fragments of your own self you would discard that you may become free?
If it is an unjust law you would abolish, that law was written with your own hand upon your own forehead.
You cannot erase it by burning your law books nor by washing the foreheads of your judges, though you pour the sea upon them.
And if it is a despot you would dethrone, see first that his throne erected within you is destroyed.
For how can a tyrant rule the free and the proud, but for a tyranny in their own freedom and a shame in their won pride?
And if it is a care you would cast off, that care has been chosen by you rather than imposed upon you.
And if it is a fear you would dispel, the seat of that fear is in your heart and not in the hand of the feared.
Verily all things move within your being in constant half embrace, the desired and the dreaded, the repugnant and the cherished, the pursued and that which you would escape.
These things move within you as lights and shadows in pairs that cling.
And when the shadow fades and is no more, the light that lingers becomes a shadow to another light.
And thus your freedom when it loses its fetters becomes itself the fetter of a greater freedom."
126,Emotion,FreedomPoemsLostFreedomPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"For those who don’t already know
This poem is not going to glow and flow
It lost its freedom years ago
Guess who dictates how the current theme goes
Arise, Arise!
Freedom is nice
Yet freedom itself comes with a price
Hence the never-ending sacrifice
After years of people giving up lives
Assisting us with out struggle to survive
To end slavery, to gain independence & to acquire autonomy
We have become the latest kind of slave, a slave of technology
Our phone conversations are listened to
Yet there is no one you can sue
Technology is watching us from cameras & satellites
Taking away our precious privacy rights
Freedom of speech, to those I outreach
Does not exist, I teach
Say the wrong things and you will be impeached
So whilst we have taken
One step forward,
We have also taken
Two steps backwards
We the slaves of new technology
Why do we embrace this new ideology?
Everything about you
Can be accessed from a central database
Is this just the beginning of a new phase?
So Arise, Arise!
Freedom is nice
But the price of freedom itself
equals the withdrawal of freedom for some
Hence the never-ending sacrifice

127,Emotion,FreedomPoemsFreedomPoembyHannahHampton,"They told me that I have all the freedom I could ask for
They told me that I had it because I was born in the United States
They told me that I was lucky
Because I have the freedom to think for myself
Because I have the freedom to criticize the government
Because I have the freedom to dress how I want
And say what I want
And be what I want
And these are all freedoms I take advantage of
And because I have the freedom to learn, I took advantage of that
And I learned that there were others without freedom
And not just in other countries
Just because they’re of another race
Just because they’re of another sexual preference
Just because they’re of another religion
Those are the reasons they don’t get freedom
Those are the people who don’t get freedom
Those people are the mistakes
Because freedom should be for everybody"

and to follow it each day
until some tiny part of it

'til at last you are near heaven's gate

This, then, the freedom that I seek
for you and all mankind

capturing heart and soul and mind.
To strike off lingering chains of doubt
look out on a new day
where freedom holds you to a task
that asks your best in every way."

we just take it,
for freedom is like a sweet laughter within your soul.
It's like a soft gentle breeze on an autumn afternoon,
when all is right with the world.
Freedom is the flame that burns down within our souls,
Can the flames burn within the souls of all,
or must the flames be drowned with tears of sorrow and pain?
For I shall not pass through this life in vain.
Let freedom warm the souls of all mankind,
for as I walk in the autumn of my life, I shall reflect

Found a marble headstone engraved with your legacy

And his soul will live ooooon
I bend down to feel the earth,
The soil telling me, this body lived only half its worth
I grabbed a shovel to undo this mistake
And try to get you to awake
Stop that sleepin in that leather coffin
I know it’s nice and quiet down there
Get to digging, all the dirt up,
Take the cobwebs out of your hair
Understanding what you’re wanting,
When you say a breath of fresh air
You’re a free man in a beautiful world
Living the dream they say
You got to wake up and shake off
All the laziness that’s in your way
Hey dreamer why are you dreaming
What are you doing still sleeping
You’re a nightmare, to handle,
And this life you’re living is a scandal
Freedom in a jail, cozy in a hole,
All that drippin wax in a candle bowl
What a waste of life that’s too much to bear
Take me seriously and start to care
Freedom is a choice, choose it with your wisdom
There ain’t no comfort zone, in any living organ
Try and take a chance, your never know the outcome
It  will be hard,
But you’re going to earn freedom

He was the one who was punished
Punished for the wonderful things he did for the people

136,Emotion,FreedomPoemsNotFreedomFightersPoembyFrancisDuggan,"Those who target and maim and kill civilians are not freedom fighters
We ought to make that one straight
They are only misguided lunatics
Who are possessed by mistrust and hate
For those they see as different to them
Who to a different god to them do pray
They sow their seeds of bad karma
And for them the price will be huge to pay.
They only hit soft and easy targets
And on such a heartless and a cowardly way
But for them what goes around will come around
That does seem fair to say.
Freedom fighters never target civilians
Well equipped armies they do not fear
And the stories of their love of Country and their bravery
Are such good stories to hear.
Those who target civilians are not freedom fighters
They only live and die in their shame
They are truly soul-less people
Unworthy of a human name."

Though not life itself

Life is not go not come.
Who said life is not divine
Life is a problem who said
Who said here in life, there
Is misery poverty and violence!
Think life a torch light
And you are free to focus
Where there is nothing
Just live and think no problem.

139,Emotion,FreedomPoemsIraqiFreedomPoembyFrancisDuggan,"They have brought Saddam to justice and handed freedom back
Or at least that is what you tell me to the people of Iraq
But i always thought that freedom included freedom to live free of fear
Whilst every day from Iraq of more deaths through violence we do hear.
If you think Iraq is such a great place to live in you should try living there
And with the basic freedoms that you now enjoy your notes you can compare
For you do not seem enlightened on matters of liberty
On your ideas of Iraq i for one could not agree.
And your ideas of freedom seem quite laughable to me
How can one even know of basic freedom if of fear one can't live free
You should spend your next holiday in Iraq with your wife and family
Otherwise your ideas of freedom i cannot take seriously.
When you talk of Iraqi freedom talk is cheap and words are easily said
The only news we hear from Iraq is of more Iraqi dead
As a holiday destination Iraq i would not recommend
Unless of course you are suicidal and you wish your life to end."

The scared soldier dashed back to the fort
He had witnessed enough
He had only went to 'experience' war
And now he wanted to go home desperately
He had made friends, lifelong they were
Good people
Then came the battles
The first six didn't take any of his best friends, only people he knew
But that last one took Charlie
Charlie was his most treasured friend
But Charlie was slowly dying
A painful death
Back at the lines was Charlie
Lying helpless in a pool of blood
Surrounded by bodies
That were badly mangled as his
The new soldier had a choice
To take refuge at the fort
Where most of the 'bravest' men had escaped to
Or risk his life for his new friend
The young man died that day
'Cry Freedom, ' he declared boldly
As he rushed to the lines
The shots fired out
And the man was thrown to his friend's side on the ground
''Thanks, man, ' said the dying friend
'I knew you would come'
Those brave men died
Fighting for our country
For our families today
Cry freedom in America
For more will die
If we keep fighting
So help with the war

And persecuted for speaking
Revealing my thoughts
How is it freedom
To fear being called strange
To think different thoughts
To the people you call friends
I live in my mind
I hide in my brain
I don't dare to speak out again
And I'm free to be lonely
And misunderstood
I'm free to be hated and shunned

It cannot be freedom

In our certitude with destiny

I read there was an old man
Who bade farewell to his only son
At the hands of his own gun
Where his actions contemporary?
Was his anger or concern temporary?
This is contemporary poem
Seeking for freedom with my pen
Vivid imagination leads to frustration
It could trigger a chain-reaction
Hence the concept of mass-killing
Is born out of an over-reacted feeling
There is no cure or process of healing
Once death is the meal we are dealing
This is contemporary poem
Seeking for freedom with my pen
We drink with intention to forget
We drink but later on regret
And the people are walking
And the people are talking
Talking about freedom, freedom
Talking about a heavenly kingdom
Talking about their great grandfathers and their moms
Talking about freedom in any shape or form
This is contemporary poem
Seeking for freedom with my pen
And it does not make any sense
Why we always speak first in defense
And it does not make any sense
Why our passion for life despite the struggle is immense
We crave for human heroes
Those who started from zero
Their brave tales flows tremendously
So our fertile hope elongates endlessly
So when you tell a lie
Look your victim deep in the eye
Penetrate their mind
Find out what you can find
Because freedom is a lie
Because freedom is a lie

To keep our country free

Challenges came to the forefront
Folks fought hard for victory
It seems each generation
Has a challenge that must be met
Luckily there are special folks

What seems free to you may not seem free to me

But in the true meaning of freedom that to little amount.
To be ruled by your own people may be seen as quite okay
But if you have to be careful with the words you do say
Then you are not a free person despite about it how you may feel
Your idea of freedom to me does not appeal.
Of love of Country you are one who brag
And your patriotism you carry in your National flag
But despite this your Government you seemingly fear
And they only tell you what you need to hear.
Patriotic songs and ballads many like to sing
And to their admiration of freedom fighters they fervently do cling
And if that's your idea of freedom well that suits me fine
Though your ideas on life are quite different to mine."

The thought of the pain seems like wants to be
The excuse for everything I fear.
I see chains and locks, ropes and nails,
On the boat the brings news from far,
I listen to screams, and shouts, and details,
While I am wishing a star.
I can feel the heart going mad,
And the breath is accelerating gently,
The thoughts that from the start I had,
Crash into me incidentally.
Delirious thinking and feelings,
That run like crazy,
Beating,
Pulsing,
Whacking,
Whipping,

The combat must cease, I fight the underkingdom,
I oppose, agitate and defend what is right,
I finally find it… all this for my freedom."

waiting and wondering, if you'll ever see your loved ones alive again.
Freedom isn't free, when a little child crys in the night,
for his or her Mommy and Daddy, and they're not there to hold them close, and comfort them, and to ease their fears, and wipe away they're tears. And all those in all the other wars, and the lives that are still being lost at this very moment.
Do you still say Freedom is free?
Freedom isn't free, when a Soldier is wounded in battle.
When news reaches, Family and friends at home,
And their told that their Soldier is wounded far beyond repair,
The loss and pain felt can not compare.
Freedom isn't free, with all those many Soldiers that wished they
had died because of all the pain in  their broken up bodies.
Freedom isn't free, when your lying in bed, and you hear that dreaded
tap on your door.And you pray to God that you were only having a bad dream.
Freedom isn't free when you open the door and listen to the
bugle play, and you feel a sudden chill.
Everything goes still.
Freedom isn't free, when there is a Flag being draped
over a coffin, of a Brother, Sister, or a friend.
Freedom isn't free, when you think of all the children,
of the mothers and the wives, of Fathers, sons and husbands, whose
lives have been interrupted.
Freedom isn't free, when you think about the graveyard at the
bottom of the sea, of  the  unmarked graves in  Arlington.
Who say's Freedom is Free? Not Me!

155,Emotion,FreedomPoemsStarsOfFreedomPoembyBobbySands,"The stars of freedom light the skies,
Uncrowned queens of yesteryear,
They were born 'mid shades of royal hue',
From mystic wombs they did appear.
Silver gems that pierce the dark.
Heavenly virgins in disguise,
That stir the heart with love and flame,
And light great flames in all men's eyes.
Oh! star of beauty in nightly hue,
You have inspired bondsmen to kings,
And lit the ways of despairing  folk,
From dreams to living things.
In the seas of time you float serene,
Oh! silver stars of nations born,
And you draw a tear to free men's eyes,
Through dungeon bars forlorn.
Oh! star of Erin, queen of tears,
Black clouds have beset thy birth,
And your people die like morning stars,
That your light may grace the earth.
But this Celtic star will be born,
And ne'er by mystic means,
But by a nation sired  in freedom's light,
And not in ancient dreams.
BOBBY SANDS was twenty seven years old when he died on the sixty sixth day of hunger-strike in the H-Block prison hospital, Long Kesh, on the 5th May 1981. The young IRA Volunteer who had spent almost the last nine years of his short life in prison as a result of his Irish republican activities was, by the time of his death, world-famous having been elected to the british parliament and having withstood pressures, political and moral (including an emissary from Pope John Paul II) , for him to abandon his fast which was aimed at countering a criminalisation policy by the british government. His name became a household word in Ireland, and his sacrifice (as did that of those who followed him)  overturned british propaganda on Ireland and had a real effect in advancing the cause of Irish freedom."
156,Emotion,FreedomPoemsFreedomPoembyDavidHarris,"Freedom is something
we take at times for granted,
it is only when we have lost it
do we see how precious it is.
Walking down the street
feeling free as can be,
but suppose we could not do that.
How would we feel?
If our voice was choked
by oppression.
What then?
Never take for granted
the things we enjoy the most.
The freedom to live
the way we choose,
for one day in the future
we could lose it
unless we are careful
in the things we do.

158,Emotion,FreedomPoemsOfOldSatFreedomOnTheHeightsPoembyAlfredLordTennyson,"Of old sat Freedom on the heights,
The thunders breaking at her feet:
Above her shook the starry lights:
She heard the torrents meet.
There in her place she did rejoice,
Self-gather'd in her prophet-mind,
But fragments of her mighty voice
Came rolling on the wind.
Then stept she down thro' town and field
To mingle with the human race,
And part by part to men reveal'd
The fulness of her face--
Grave mother of majestic works,
From her isle-altar gazing down,
Who, God-like, grasps the triple forks,
And, King-like, wears the crown:
Her open eyes desire the truth.
The wisdom of a thousand years
Is in them. May perpetual youth
Keep dry their light from tears;
That her fair form may stand and shine,
Make bright our days and light our dreams,
Turning to scorn with lips divine
The falsehood of extremes!"
159,Emotion,FreedomPoemsFreedomFromTheSelfPoembyRenuRakhejaakaTranquilOcean,"Thinking can never be free
Stems from the conditioning deep in our minds
Cultural...Social...Literary tree
Glued to us putting us in a bind
We think our thoughrs are free
But are they really? ?
Any books or poems for that matter that we read
Or the ideals or the principles that we lead
Are all rooted to the mind thats been fed
All the learning from the life we have led
Every thought being a result from that
Whats the newness, may I ask? ?
Just be aware of what that signifies
Observe what it means, do not fight
Try and slowly uncondition the mind
Without a conflict that can make you blind
Make the mind still, remove all thoughts
Remove the veil of words, maybe it blots? ?
A flash of understanding, a rapidity of insight
When mind is not burdened by its own noise
It is the memory that really interevenes
Challenge and Response in between
A chattering mind cannot understand
Truth... which is like a thief creeping into a still  night."

Heart filled with fire
To have her one dream
Her inner most desire
She will never tell
She will never say a word
Because the bird of freedom soars in his eyes
She must not disturb
A life unlived
A dream untold
This man she cannot get
This man she cannot hold
But still she has hope
Hope of living her life
And hope of dreaming her dreams
Hope that one day he may see
Freedom
The same she sees in him
She cannot love another
Nor hold another's hand
She prays every night he'll just understand
She feels freedom around his presence
That feeling she gets no where else
His dreams are reality
His life is being lived
Because he has freedom as it is"

Cremated remains which will be placed in an urn

Some will mourn quietly within themselves
But all will remember the man
For while he is but ashes now
Soon to be cast out upon the open Sea
He was however, if only for a brief time
A true American hero to me....

My wife with the hair of a wood fire
With the thoughts of heat lightning
With the waist of an hourglass
With the waist of an otter in the teeth of a tiger
My wife with the lips of a cockade and of a bunch of stars of the last magnitude
With the teeth of tracks of white mice on the white earth
With the tongue of rubbed amber and glass
My wife with the tongue of a stabbed host
With the tongue of a doll that opens and closes its eyes
With the tongue of an unbelievable stone
My wife with the eyelashes of strokes of a child's writing
With brows of the edge of a swallow's nest
My wife with the brow of slates of a hothouse roof

And of a fountain with dolphin-heads beneath the ice
My wife with wrists of matches
My wife with fingers of luck and ace of hearts
With fingers of mown hay
My wife with armpits of marten and of beechnut
And of Midsummer Night
Of privet and of an angelfish nest
With arms of seafoam and of riverlocks
And of a mingling of the wheat and the mill
My wife with legs of flares
With the movements of clockwork and despair
My wife with calves of eldertree pith
My wife with feet of initials
With feet of rings of keys and Java sparrows drinking
My wife with a neck of unpearled barley
My wife with a throat of the valley of gold
Of a tryst in the very bed of the torrent
With breasts of night
My wife with breasts of a marine molehill
My wife with breasts of the ruby's crucible
With breasts of the rose's spectre beneath the dew
My wife with the belly of an unfolding of the fan of days
With the belly of a gigantic claw
My wife with the back of a bird fleeing vertically
With a back of quicksilver
With a back of light
With a nape of rolled stone and wet chalk
And of the drop of a glass where one has just been drinking
My wife with hips of a skiff
With hips of a chandelier and of arrow-feathers
And of shafts of white peacock plumes
Of an insensible pendulum
My wife with buttocks of sandstone and asbestos
My wife with buttocks of swans' backs
My wife with buttocks of spring
With the sex of an iris
My wife with the sex of a mining-placer and of a platypus
My wife with a sex of seaweed and ancient sweetmeat
My wife with a sex of mirror
My wife with eyes full of tears
With eyes of purple panoply and of a magnetic needle
My wife with savanna eyes
My wife with eyes of water to he drunk in prison
My wife with eyes of wood always under the axe
My wife with eyes of water-level of level of air earth and fire"

167,Emotion,FreedomPoemsFreedomAndLovePoembyThomasCampbell,"How delicious is the winning
Of a kiss at love's beginning,
When two mutual hearts are sighing
For the knot there's no untying!
Yet remember, 'Midst our wooing,
Love has bliss, but Love has ruing;
Other smiles may make you fickle,
Tears for other charms may trickle.
Love he comes, and Love he tarries,
Just as fate or fancy carries;
Longest stays, when sorest chidden;
Laughs and flies, when press'd and bidden.
Bind the sea to slumber stilly,
Bind its odour to the lily,
Bind the aspen ne'er to quiver,
Then bind Love to last for ever.
Love's a fire that needs renewal
Of fresh beauty for its fuel:
Love's wing moults when caged and captured,
Only free, he soars enraptured.
Can you keep the bee from ranging
Or the ringdove's neck from changing?
No! nor fetter'd Love from dying
In the knot there's no untying."

Fastened are lives, likewise
one and all in this universe
to the unraveled hidden source.
Yet humans run in nescience
towards illusory independence.
Stop your sprint

start searching your inner alcoves.
Not really fathoms deep to grope...
well nigh the ultimate free rein
in the wellspring; The Mighty Divine!"

171,Emotion,FreedomPoemsFreedomAtMidnightPoembySathyaNarayana,"At the stroke of twelve; midnight
we earned freedom! Well! We did it!
We waited, waited, waited, waited
we waited not just six hours for dawn,
but alas for sixty five years in vain.
Very few dredged the darkness to fetch the light;
but many spewed venoms to stretch the night.
Terrorists, factionists and fanatics
gained the reins of the reign in dark
to run their rackets free of any fetters
while remained our leaders, indolent,
insolent, corrupt and inept with no intent
to direct and correct the groping multitude.
Commoners too care not the dark nor feel any remorse
even if the long waited day-break
starts with a longest solar eclipse.
They preferred smug slumber and lives with no bother
and forgot sans doubt with perfidious conceit
the blood and sweat shed by our great founding fathers.
Fumbling are we still in gloom to untie many a Gordian knot!
Oh God! Save my country from all these Stygian fogs!"

Some foresee what others cannot see
Freedom is walking away with glee
We have a right to Christmas with a tree
We have a right to enjoy a shopping spree
We have a right to travel the land and the sea
We have the right to an educational degree
Stop the silly talking
Whilst Freedom is walking
Freedom is not a jubilee
Freedom is not a guarantee
Who says Freedom is free?
It is spoken man is free of thought
Without the need to fear higher courts
Some have spoken and finally resorted
To hide their thoughts from being reported
We have a right to a chosen culture
We have a right not to be tortured
We have a right to nationality and security
We have a right to be part of a minority
Stop the silly talking
Whilst Freedom is walking
Freedom is not part of community
Freedom is never an informality
Who says Freedom is immunity?
We want opinion without distinction
We want a world without discrimination
We want a kingdom of utter freedom
We want it in all shapes and form

173,Emotion,FreedomPoemsOneMinuteOfFreedomPoembyWilliamCook,"realization
a never-ending vision
the horizon
perpetually receding
a being, spinning
quite alone
eyelids dissolved
that second of freedom
when the heart
skips a beat
I can make the sky cry
the clouds fume & rage
worlds shrink
level hills/mountains
smash cities
hold the sun burning in my hand
then swallow it
I am alien
& everyone
& no-one
a giant killer
& a giant
I am dead & alive
where is the ritual
that means more than this?
where has it all gone
if it ever existed at all?
a naked couple
straddles the white steel flagpole
gazing hungrily at the twisting flag
flapping lazily
in the warm breeze above
sweat glistening on their slick backs
they squat in unison
tilting heads back
grasping the pole then
sliding up its length
shimmying, legs elongating
their bodies stretch & merge
transformation of national pride
into tumultuous serpent
twisting on a skewer
meaning — in pain
or in fantasy...
what follows us
will be our shadow
our blood
hot & boiling
with hate
wanting nothing better
than to kill
our rotting memory...
to the insights
of the poetic vision
the truth dictates ignorance
to replace purpose
god cannot undo what has been done
she cries, after she hits me
this hurts me more than it hurts you
& she is right
my pain only occurs in flesh
my conscienceless heart
hung like a stone in cement
youthful arrogant sadism
wielded like a fist in her face
her daughter runs sobbing from the kitchen-knife
held playfully at her throat
now back in the drawer
hidden from view — coveted
she rids the house of all its weapons
to cut meat is father’s privilege
I make the most of my own collection
carving apples with a stolen cutlass
like ‘Jim Hawkins, ’ considering
the spot between the captain’s shoulder-blades...
nothing is as plain as it seems
when you put words to it
when you apply words to the world
hopping like a sand fly
ducking diving dodging hiding
behind between on top of
wind-blown dunes
alive with writhing copulation
through the swaying swishing cutting-grass
pink bodies entwined in a sandy furrow
caught between
a gesture & a pose
you contemplate my gaze
lost
in a beautiful moment
your heart flows
out of your face
into my mouth
burrowing deep
in my throbbing heart
like a knife
I am your servant
my dry lips drink
from your river
from your wounded life
yet words don’t quench
my body’s love for you
without you
the thick air I breathe
is poisonous & empty...
it is terrible without you
when you are next to me
asleep
I dream we are together
forever in dream
or reality — whatever
I will strive to be with you
to appease this thirst
with your beauty
with your evanescent presence
melancholy
your form eludes me
your effect
preys witness
to my beating heart
kids leaping clouds
as quick shadows scroll
across the concrete path
passing fast like planes above1
drawn to a knobbled breast of tree
perched on a reclining withered trunk
whorls of years knotted in grain & bark
an iris of ages — a lichened Aeolian
the wind whistling across its gnarled chest
collapse = expansion due to reversal of time
everything collapses
My god, My god — why have you forsaken me?
Eli Eli lama sabachthani?
Why can’t we see wind?
Early on, I walked the streets & recognised good & evil at play — I first learnt of their essential nature through TV dreams & broken books that wept from septic wounds so bloody & so beautiful.
At home, I watched & participated in the tragic farce of human comedy performed on every urban stage, set against the fantastic nightmare of domesticity & banal relationships.
I
painted hills with fire & houses with blood — walked on the clouds throwing handfuls of dung down on skittering pedestrians hiding under clotheslines, old cars, smashed mailboxes, pornographic magazines held above their shaven heads...
I kept a journal painted with words & crude ink drawings, to record my existence in terms of my surroundings...
Death becomes us
More & more
Shifting stark worlds
Impure to pure
the harsh white light awaits"

You all were quite intelligent and hardworking
And could have easily led the life of a king
But you chose the life of danger and struggle
To liberate your motherland from the British government's shackle
You relentlessly fought against the world's greatest colonial power
And successfully helped to blossom India's independence flower.
India will always remain grateful for you peoples' supreme service
You are Mother India's golden children, whom we will always miss.

And I myself shall smoke
crucified Christ-like on wings of bombers

My skin trembles with explosions
as if it were Vietnam
and breaking my back and ribs
the Berlin Wall runs through me
You talk to me of freedom? Empty question
under umbrellas of bombs in the sky
It’s a disgrace to be free of your own age
A hundred times more shameful than to be its slave
Yes I’m enslaved to Tashkent women
and to Dallas bullets and Peking slogans
and Vietnam widows and Russian women
with picks beside the tracks and kerchiefs over their eyes
Yes I’m not free of Pushkin and Blok
Not free of the State of Maryland and Zima Station
Not free of the Devil and God
Not free of earth’s beauty and its shit
Yes I’m enslaved to a thirst for taking a wet-mop
to the heads of all the bickerers & butchers of the world
Yes I’m enslaved to the honor of busting the mugs

177,Emotion,FreedomPoemsFreedomPoembyAmbroseBierce,"Freedom, as every schoolboy knows,
Once shrieked as Kosciusko fell;
On every wind, indeed, that blows
I hear her yell.
She screams whenever monarchs meet,
And parliaments as well,
To bind the chains about her feet
And toll her knell.
And when the sovereign people cast
The votes they cannot spell,
Upon the pestilential blast
Her clamors swell.
For all to whom the power's given
To sway or to compel,
Among themselves apportion Heaven
And give her Hell.

and fate is set in stone
then nothing that you'll ever do
is down to you alone
You can't be blamed for following
the paths down which you're led
when choices that aren't really yours
are scything through your head
It's not your job to sympathise
with every victim's plight
perception is subjective
there is no wrong or right
If your mind is built to fit
a predetermined state
it's not your fault you're overwhelmed
by other people's hate
But instead of being constrictive
destiny makes sense
Unfettered by choice, the conscience flies
free from consequence."

To search the lands, the seas, the skies.

The gift of Wings to fly and soar.
Worlds are combined once again.
United at last, for the gift of Freedom.
Wanting to taste this gift,
One may die, greed or even kill.
Only when voices are unanimous,
Only when worlds are united,
Only when humans no longer envy,
Only then.. Will we truly procure the Wings of Freedom.

With hopes, emotions, days of grey and blue.
Accepting combat, trying to win through,
To fight again, for freedom.
Remember them, for they were young and green,
With so much life ahead, as yet unseen.
They knew not what they faced, but all were keen,
To fight again, for freedom.
Remember them, each fought to give us peace,
That each fierce conflict in this world, would cease.
And then when all was done, they’d find release,
From fighting foes, for freedom.
Remember them, who’ve joined the heroes roll,
Their names inscribed now, on a parchment scroll.
Thousands did not survive the war’s hellhole,
To fight again, for freedom.
Remember them.

183,Emotion,FreedomPoemsFreedomInYourMarriagePoembyRichardMerrell,"Is there freedom in your marriage?
Or is there bondage bringing woe
Is there freedom in your marriage?
This is what I'd like to know.
For marriage is two people
Each sharing the others love
Not telling each other how to live
Nor giving each other the shove.
For each is an individual
With free-will to be such;
Giving and receiving in their talents -
However much.
Having freedom to enjoy at times
What each may like to do;
Pleasing each other by attitude
Being happy for each too.
Standing by each other
When outsiders shoot the tongue
No matter what the cost might be
For freedom you're among.
So, is there freedom in your marriage?
I pray there is today,
For only in love's freedom -
Marriage will be for aye!"

Somewhere within my head, a poem’s carefully strung.

When it has been carefully sprung.
Beneath my fingers I see the strong tough paper.
Somewhere within my head a poem’s shining through.
Then one will be exhibited, joined with the other,
Where they will be seen, shining new.
Beneath my fingers I hear the crisp firm paper.
Somewhere within my head a poem’s freedom bound.
When one will be entrusted to join with the other,
Then freedom will at last be found.

185,Emotion,FreedomPoemsWarLivesAddLoveFreedomPoembyDaveTanguay,"Remembered
A nation born from war, for the “purpose” of establishing freedom
A nation divided in war, in an “attempt” to fulfill the goal of freedom
A nation engaged in world wars, in the task of “preserving” freedom
A nation policing the world, in the “pursuit” of freedom
So many young lives have been lost, for the “cause” of freedom
Let us remember those who paid the “ultimate price, ” for freedom
And dear God, please tell us! - “What! ” - is freedom?
We need not war
We need not war, to show us how freedom is made
What we need is love to show us how freedom is played.
For freedom is not - but to “do as we please”
But rather, to “please others, ” because of what we achieve.
No such thing!
There is no such passion as hate, - only - a mental state
Of ignorance
For what we fail to understand, from our source of knowledge
We choose the accepted norm of utter indifference
Therefore, our feelings of love, we profoundly fear to acknowledge
“Freedom” is to serve
“To serve requires love; only with love, do we obtain freedom”

She thought of them stepping out of a bath
And him wrapping cloth around her.
He thought of her walking up in a small white building,
He thought of stones settling into the ground.
Then they were gone.
Then they came in through the back.
Her cat ran out.
The house was near the road.
She didn't like the cat going out.
They stayed at the table.
The others were out of breath.
The man and the woman reached across the table.
They were afraid, they smiled.
The other poured themselves the last of the coffee.
Burning their tongues.
The man and the woman looked at them.
They didn't say anything.
The man and the woman moved closer to each other,
The round table between them.
The stove was still on and burned the empty pot.
She started to get up.
One of them shot her.
She leaned over the table like a schoolgirl doing her lessons.
She thought about being beside him, being asleep.
They took her long gray socks
Put them over the barrel of a rifle
And shot him.
He went back in his chair, holding himself.
She told him hers didn't hurt much,
Like in the fall when everything you touch
Makes a spark.
He thought about her getting up in the dark
Wrapping a quilt around herself.
And standing in the doorway.
She asked the men if they shot them again
Not to hurt their faces.
One of them lit him one of his cigarettes.
He thought what it would be like
Being children together.
He was dead before he finished it.
She asked them could she take it out of his mouth.
So it wouldn't burn his lips.
She reached over and touched his hair.
She thought about him walking through the dark singing.
She died on the table like that,
Smoke coming out of his mouth."

191,Emotion,FreedomPoemsASadStateOfFreedomPoembyNazimHikmet,"You waste the attention of your eyes,
the glittering labour of your hands,
and knead the dough enough for dozens of loaves
of which you'll taste not a morsel;
you are free to slave for others--
you are free to make the rich richer.
The moment you're born
they plant around you
mills that grind lies
lies to last you a lifetime.
You keep thinking in your great freedom
a finger on your temple
free to have a free conscience.
Your head bent as if half-cut from the nape,
your arms long, hanging,
your saunter about in your great freedom:
you're free
with the freedom of being unemployed.
You love your country
as the nearest, most precious thing to you.
But one day, for example,
they may endorse it over to America,
and you, too, with your great freedom--
you have the freedom to become an air-base.
You may proclaim that one must live
not as a tool, a number or a link
but as a human being--
then at once they handcuff your wrists.
You are free to be arrested, imprisoned
and even hanged.
There's neither an iron, wooden
nor a tulle curtain
in your life;
there's no need to choose freedom:
you are free.
But this kind of freedom
is a sad affair under the stars.
Translated by Taner Baybars"
192,Emotion,FreedomPoemsIPreferTheGorgeousFreedomPoembyAleksandrAleksandrovichBlok,"I prefer the gorgeous freedom,
And I fly to lands of grace,
Where in wide and clear meadows
All is good, as dreams, and blest.
Here they rice: the clover clear,
And corn-flower's gentle lace,
And the rustle is always here:
""Ears are leaning... Take your ways!""
In this immense sea of fair,
Only one of blades reclines.
You don't see in misty air,
I'd seen it!It will be mine!"
193,Emotion,FreedomPoemsLibertyThePrincessOfFreedomPoembyBudTaylor,"There's a free in freedom
a dominate in dom
dominate implies ownership
terminates empowerment
Dominion demands tribute
like the tributaries of Berg Lake
Mount Robson its watershed
the waters of rejuvenation
Flora & Fauna its tribute
When you have realized your identity
when you take a stand in every understanding
when you cease as a convict in control
Control illusory
the only real control
self-control
After you butt the troll from each bridge in your journey
when your voice is clear strong
call to the heavens
From the spire in inspire
your Knight will deliver
the delicate flowers spirea
You will know the free in freedom
and free to speak
to be listened
Only then will you be free
to see the Phoebes
Kingfishers
And cast away
free from fear
freedom to dream"
194,Emotion,FreedomPoemsFreedomPoembyHelenHuntJackson,"What freeman knoweth freedom? Never he
Whose father's father through long lives have reigned
O'er kingdoms which mere heritage attained.
Though from his youth to age he roam as free
As winds, he dreams not freedom's ecstacy.
But he whose birth was in a nation chained
For centuries; where every breath was drained
From breasts of slaves which knew not there could be
Such thing as freedom,--he beholds the light
Burst, dazzling; though the glory blind his sight
He knows the joy. Fools laugh because he reels
And weilds confusedly his infant will;
The wise man watching with a heart that feels
Says: ""Cure for freedom's harms is freedom still."""
195,Emotion,FreedomPoemsFreedomPoembyJenHuan,"Precious like time,
Fragile like a baby.
A dream, a vision, a fantasy,
An individual's most valued possession.
Enabling yourself to soar through the horizon.
Hopes coming true,
Doors opening,
Chambers unlocking.
Feeling inside unexplainable,
Merely looking further towards forthcoming.
No past, no present,
Only the future in the beholder's hands.
Opinons differ in everyone's eye.
Easily taken away,
Earned by heart,
An everlasting promise."
196,Emotion,FreedomPoemsFreedomFromWantPoembyAdamConway,"the crescent moon chip of a coffee cup
against your (needlessly)   pursed lips
and suddenly, you taste it-
the iron history of twenty years
of boy
without a hand on your shoulder
epiphany frames the corners of your mouth
pioneering your desert skin
as it clears a trail
for the vandal wrinkles
of your recession
drip-dropping off the edges of the earth
onto new coat and clashing tie
you rush to the sink
the taunting softness of cotton embracing your lips
and you’re hopelessly aware that you could spill truth for hours
and no one would be around to wipe it up
or to carry you off to sleep
or to bleach away the stain
of his god.damn.absence.
you look up, through the mirror
and hear a stranger at the keys
tapping out the same song you thought you wrote
when you were sixteen (a clenching, bluesy number)
about a girl asleep by a payphone
about a boy trapped in a bus stop
about some dumbass kid who burned off all the nerve-endings on his hands one fourth of july
(about the shortest story ever told)
“well baby i went to bed last night” (a louis armstrong voice that sorta swallows you)
“and when i woke up this morning” (decrescendo)
“I Wasn’t.”"

Struggling to be free,
The butterfly soon left its cage.
Nevermore a worm to be.
Born anew to be a sign
Of beauty, grace and life.
A light among a gloomy world
And hope in the midst of strife.
Oh, butterfly, with wings outspread,
Glistening in the light.
Show us how to fly with ease
As you begin your freedom flight."

199,Emotion,CouragePoemsTheAbnormalIsNotCouragePoembyJackGilbert,"The Poles rode out from Warsaw against the German
Tanks on horses.  Rode knowing, in sunlight, with sabers,
A magnitude of beauty that allows me no peace.
And yet this poem would lessen that day. Question
The bravery. Say it's not courage. Call it a passion.
Would say courage isn't that. Not at its best.
It was impossible, and with form. They rode in sunlight,
Were mangled. But I say courage is not the abnormal.
Not the marvelous act. Not Macbeth with fine speeches.
The worthless can manage in public, or for the moment.
It is too near the whore's heart: the bounty of impulse,
And the failure to sustain even small kindness.
Not the marvelous act, but the evident conclusion of being.
Not strangeness, but a leap forward of the same quality.
Accomplishment.  The even loyalty.  But fresh.
Not the Prodigal Son, nor Faustus. But Penelope.
The thing steady and clear. Then the crescendo.
The real form. The culmination. And the exceeding.
Not the surprise. The amazed understanding. The marriage,
Not the month's rapture.  Not the exception.  The beauty
That is of many days. Steady and clear.
It is the normal excellence, of long accomplishment."

Yeah, tap into my sharpened senses
I have the courage to speak
I have the courage to think
I am me, today and tomorrow
With courage we engage
Bringing new things to life's stage
We remove excessive baggage
As we try hard to be above average
Tap in, Tap in
Yeah, tap into my sharpened senses
Don't attempt to break down my defences
I have the courage to encourage
I rage upon those who discourage
For those who clap their hands in pretence
At my courageous expenses give out only offense
Courage has built me a new image
I feel as if I have entered a new age
I stand out now as I have come out of my cage
Making a difference as I get rid of blockages
Tap in, Tap in
Yeah, tap into my sharpened senses

Courage is the way forward
Courage sets the stage for change
Today is only today because of the courage of others"

The world needs Courage and Hope
It needs voices that believe-
It needs kindness and caring and love
But also the strength of conviction
The world needs so much
My own doubting and questioning voice lacks
What I have to give
Is not what Humanity most needs.
More questions, more self- obsessions
The endless example of the single individual
Striving to create what he may never be able to.
God of  Love of Goodness and of Kindness
I am afraid You need a lot stronger servants than I."
204,Emotion,CouragePoemsWhatGivesYouCouragePoembyAlishaRicks,"Without fear there cannot be courage
Fear drives the unthinkable out of us

What gives you courage to get out of bed?
What gives you courage to drive when you know it's dangerous?
What gives you courage to succeed?
What gives you courage to survive?
What gives you courage to strive?
People have courage to live for their children
People have courage to live for themselves
People have courage to live for hope
People have courage because they believe
People have courage to not give up
Fear is not the essence of life
But a free soul not tamed
Courage is the journey of your heart
Guided by strength
On a path of untamed obstacles
Let courage guide you
As you begin your quest"
205,Emotion,CouragePoemsLackOfCouragePoembyLindaEngwall,"Most days I feel
Like I am
Losing so much time
Sitting
Waiting
Hoping
For you to change
Never knowing quite for sure
If it is me or you that must change
Always believed that by
Not moving
Making no decision
Is the same as making one
Wondering if it is due to my lack of strength
Or no courage
To take those hits
That will happen if I choose
To move
Now
Wish I knew if this was truly my choice
Or one made only by lack of my courage"
206,Emotion,CouragePoemsCouragePoembyStephenCrane,"There were many who went in huddled procession,
They knew not whither;
But, at any rate, success or calamity
Would attend all in equality.
There was one who sought a new road.
He went into direful thickets,
And ultimately he died thus, alone;
But they said he had courage."
207,Emotion,CouragePoemsCouragePoembyEdgarAlbertGuest,"Courage isn't a brilliant dash,
A daring deed in a moment's flash;
It isn't an instantaneous thing
Born of despair with a sudden spring
It isn't a creature of flickered hope
Or the final tug at a slipping rope;
But it's something deep in the soul of man
That is working always to serve some plan.
Courage isn't the last resort
In the work of life or the game of sport;
It isn't a thing that a man can call
At some future time when he's apt to fall;
If he hasn't it now, he will have it not
When the strain is great and the pace is hot.
For who would strive for a distant goal
Must always have courage within his soul.
Courage isn't a dazzling light
That flashes and passes away from sight;
It's a slow, unwavering, ingrained trait
With the patience to work and the strength to wait.
It's part of a man when his skies are blue,
It's part of him when he has work to do.
The brave man never is freed of it.
He has it when there is no need of it.
Courage was never designed for show;
It isn't a thing that can come and go;
It's written in victory and defeat
And every trial a man may meet.
It's part of his hours, his days and his years,
Back of his smiles and behind his tears.
Courage is more than a daring deed:
It's the breath of life and a strong man's creed."
208,Emotion,CouragePoemsCourageAndBoldnessPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"God has given courage and boldness
That must certainly be reflected on face
Women of today are by all means capable
Handle the situation and come out as successful
In any situation charm must be retained
Smile on face should never be deserted
If that is allowed then wolves may simply not pounce
Take away flash and enjoy their yield of an ounce
World as such is no safe heaven
For a lady and staying as single woman
People may try to take advantage
Try to inflict injury that may not be worth to mention on page
So it is nice to defend self and get prepared
So no one comes and simply dared
Someone has to take lead and show courage
Whole of the community then may show comeback on stage
Female today is not helpless animal
She has teeth to bite and stand for real trial
What else is needed in real time?
Bit courage, self confidence and presence of mind sometimes"
209,Emotion,CouragePoemsCouragePoembyEdwardVeilleux,"It's hard to translate one's feelings into speech,
It takes time to overcome the obstacles we meet.
Don't live life scared of what your words will bring,
Even if you fail, at least you attempted to do something.
In this life I would rather fail everyday,
And tell my stories of the one's that got away...
Then sit alone with my regrets always haunting me...
'I could have been, but I never had the courage to be.'"

213,Emotion,CouragePoemsCourageUnderFirePoembyAdryanBarnathan,"they'll
fall away
one by one
as strands of you
milk the moments
you had
for what they were worth,
still smouldering
in the hand
even though
you knew
in your hearts mind
that
it was pretence
as they smiled
behind soft
contemptuous lips
that offer you
quiet resentment
instead of love
just because
you breathe
and are
uniquely you,
and that
makes them
uncomfortable
against their
square jawed
perfect,
materialistic plan
that can't afford
you
but can
their every whim
which makes them
sorely aware
of their
superlative selves
so they
push you away
thinking
you are less
then them
because
you don't fit
but you keep
steering steadfast
in the sanctity
of truth
inside of trust
as the most valuable
integer
and they fear
''your being''
because
through you
they see
themselves
impoverished,
and their superior
ways collapse
in blind belief
as they continue
to make spaces
''for time''
more than sharing
or listening
or caring
for anyone else
because
what they want
is never enough-
so let them fall away
to be left
as dust
when matter
does not matter
and when you are
feeling raw and
naked and
real
then you can
afford
the comfort
of being
with another
and that is
what is true
and right
and real
and what you
are all about.

214,Emotion,CouragePoemsCouragePoembyHerbertNehrlich,"When first I jumped it did not take persuasion,
much stronger forces needed fighting 'til they quit.
One trusts a parachute on only one occasion
until the next time when they ask for Agent Grit.
To overcome the inner guardian and succeed
in hairy matters that are threatening to life
it is essential that one recognize the need
to substitute BIG for a smaller strife.
And so it was when I was sitting on the bench,
with Magdalena from the Catholic Lycée,
we had progressed to kissing longer, and in French,
but my left hand,  perched on her knee, would not obey.
It took an hour of the strongest concentration.
And only promises of later, greater pleasures
at last allowed me to give in to motivation
to roam around and find the greatest of all treasures."

217,Emotion,CouragePoemsASoldiersWarOfCouragePoembyGailDoyle,"Courage is standing in the middle of a war zone
Not knowing if you’ll be making it back home
Courage is leaving your loved ones behind
Not knowing for sure if you were seeing them for the last time
Courage is holding the weapon in your hand in a do or die place
Not showing the enemy traces of your fear and despair on your face
Courage is able to sleep at night with one eye open and eye closed
Not knowing if tomorrow, you’ll be the next one not coming home
Courage is reading a letter from a loved one holding back the tears
Remaining strong is your mission and survival becomes your darkest fears
Courage is seeing soldiers die right in front of you
While you are aware that your life is at risk for a mission you were born to do
Courage is being a hero in everyone’s eyes
Whether or not you come out alive
There, you will always and forever remain; a Soldier’s War of Courage…"

That made the world so beautiful to live with
Through his hard work and intelligence
Made wonderful achievements for human sake
The first set of courageous men's desires
Taught them how to hunter using the stones
They studied the necessity on events
And sharpening the stone articles used for hunting
Their strong courage and determination
Made them active to face the challenges
It is the courage of men in earlier eras
Invented the wind ridden ships and vessels
Through their courage and wisdom
Together with the determination and skills
They found new worlds and new people
They ascertained new avenues of gains
But for the invasions of fight in new places
The stiff competitions the real successors
Survived the fittest among them
It is through the courage adopted from footsteps
Of our bygone era of forefathers
That we learnt the qualities of courage
New inventions now continuing and ongoing
New planets are imminent to conquer
New places we aspire to be conquered
Where human beings will make their new homes
Provided water sources and breathing air is there
It is our courage and wisdom that follows
Through the intelligence and decisiveness
That we gain for a better future
Where the world will be better for tomorrow."

220,Emotion,CouragePoemsTheTwainCalledScareAndCouragePoembyAniruddhaPathak,"The least because he trembles to grey fear
That man should call courage to conquer fright,
Fine if a man at times should frightened be,
Not if he should flight from fear’s bleary blight,
Howso brave, a man needs courage no mean
To face, fight, and conquer what he does fear,
And he needs to fear first— courage to win,
That dwells yon fear, yet close enough and near.
King Odysseus, who this truth knew just fine,
Reasoned Achilles to fight the Trojan War:
If ye should fear no one, problem ‘tis thine,
Do keep fear close to thy courageous shore.
Ah, soothing most words these I’ve ever heard:
No man courageous is that hath ne’er feared.

used to be so strong.
used to know what's right from wrong.
gobbled the poison, fought my own premonitions.
how i stayed on track with my faith and my reasons.
The less traveled road is where I am on.
rough and narrow from dusk till dawn.
Stunned by an unforeseen path,

222,Emotion,CouragePoemsCouragePoembyAnonymous,"Courage is the strength to stand up
When it's easier to fall down and lose hold.
It is the conviction to explore new horizons
When it's easier to believe what we've been told.
Courage is the desire to maintain our integrity
When it's easier to look the other way.
It is feeling happy and alive, and moving forward
When it's easier to feel sorry for ourselves and stay.
Courage is the will to shape our world
When it's easier to let someone else do it for us.
It is the recognition that none of us are perfect
When it's easier to criticize others and fuss.
Courage is the power to step forward and lead
When it's easier to follow the crowd; their pleas resound.
It is the spirit that places you on top of the mountain
When it's easier to never leave the ground.
The foundation of courage is solid,
The rock that doesn't roll.
Courage is the freedom
Of our mind, body, and soul!"

Struck the one note that the hapless Ithacans
Travel-sick, mazed, bemused, could understand,
And understanding, follow.
'Courage,' he said, 'remember, is not Hope!'
He left the worn, safe ship, spume-stained and hollow.
'To be courageous is to face despair.'
And through the groves and 'thwart the ambient air
Resounded reedy echoes:
'Face despair!'
But this they understood.
And plunging on prepared for best, and most prepared
For worst, found only in their stride
A deep umbrageous wood,
And grassy plains where they disported; eased
And bathed lame feet within a purling stream
And murmured: 'Here, Odysseus, would we fain abide!'
But neither the stream's sweet ease
Nor the shade of the vast beech-trees,
Nor the blessed sense
Of the sweet, sweet soil
Beneath feet salt-cracked and worn
Brought to them even then,
(Still fainting and frayed and forlorn),
Such complete recompense
As the knowledge that once again
Facing the new and untried,
They had kept the courage of men!"

Courage is what it takes to make your own decisions

225,Emotion,CouragePoemsItTakesCouragePoembyAnonymous,"To refrain from gossip
When others delight in it,
To stand up for the absent person
Who is being abused.
It takes courage
To live honestly
Within your means,
And not dishonestly
On the means of others.
It takes courage
To be a real man or a true woman,
To hold fast to your ideals
When it causes you
To be looked upon
As strange and peculiar.
It takes courage
To be talked about,
And remain silent;
When a word would justify you
In the eyes of others,
But which you dare not speak
Because it would injure another.
It takes courage
To refuse to do something
That is wrong
Although everyone else
May be doing it
With attitudes as carefree
As a summer song.
It takes courage
To live according
To your own convictions,
To deny yourself
What you cannot afford.
To love your neighbor
As yourself!"
226,Emotion,CouragePoemsCeQuiDoitMÉtonnerExciteMonCouragePoembyJeanOgierdeGombauld,"Ce qui doit m'étonner excite mon courage,
Et ma témérité me conduit au cercueil ;
Je sers une beauté plus dure qu'un écueil,
Et l'amour se conserve où l'espoir fait naufrage.
Aveugle passion, fureur, manie et rage,
Vous faites que j'adore un insensible orgueil.
Le plus cruel abord est comme un doux accueil,
Et j'appelle un mépris un agréable outrage.
J'ai pour toute faveur, et pour rigueur du sort,
Une peine charmante, une amoureuse mort,
Et je fonde la vie en ce qu'elle a de pire.
Mon astre me réduit à la nécessité
De ne respirer point, alors que je soupire,
Et ma seule douleur est ma félicité."
227,Emotion,CouragePoemsCouragePoembySriChinmoyGhose,"To speak ill of the world
Needs courage,
But fortunately or unfortunately
Everybody has that courage.
To love the world
As one's own,
Very own,
Needs courage.
Unfortunately, most of us are wanting
In that courage.
The courage of the heart,
The courage of the soul
We badly need,
And not the courage
Of the unruly,
Aggressive,
Impure,
Demanding vital."

229,Emotion,CouragePoemsCouragePoembyClaudeMcKay,"O lonely heart so timid of approach,
Like the shy tropic flower that shuts its lips
To the faint touch of tender finger tips:
What is your word? What question would you broach?
Your lustrous-warm eyes are too sadly kind
To mask the meaning of your dreamy tale,
Your guarded life too exquisitely frail
Against the daggers of my warring mind.
There is no part of the unyielding earth,
Even bare rocks where the eagles build their nest,
Will give us undisturbed and friendly rest.
No dewfall softens this vast belt of dearth.
But in the socket-chiseled teeth of strife,
That gleam in serried files in all the lands,
We may join hungry, understanding hands,
And drink our share of ardent love and life."
230,Emotion,CouragePoemsFeignedCouragePoembyCharlesLamb,"Horatio, of ideal courage vain,
Was flourishing in air his father's cane,
And, as the fumes of valour swelled his pate,
Now thought himself this hero, and now that:
'And now,' he cried, 'I will Achilles be;
My sword I brandish; see, the Trojans flee.
Now I'll be Hector, when his angry blade
A lane through heaps of slaughtered Grecians made!
And now by deeds still braver I'll evince
I am no less than Edward the Black Prince.-
Give way, ye coward French-' As thus he spoke,
And aimed in fancy a sufficient stroke
To fix the fate of Cressy or Poictiers
(The Muse relates the hero's fate with tears);
He struck his milk-white hand against a nail,
Sees his own blood, and feels his courage fail.
Ah! where is now that boasted valour flown,
That in the tented field so late was shown!
Achilles weeps, Great Hector hangs the head,
And the Black Prince goes whimpering to bed."
231,Emotion,CouragePoemsTheCourageThatMyMotherHadPoembyEdnaStVincentMillay,"The courage that my mother had
Went with her, and is with her still:
Rock from New England quarried;
Now granite in a granite hill.
The golden brooch my mother wore
She left behind for me to wear;
I have no thing I treasure more:
Yet, it is something I could spare.
Oh, if instead she'd left to me
The thing she took into the grave!—
That courage like a rock, which she
Has no more need of, and I have."

An empty noise of death the battle's roar,
If vital hope be wanting to restore,
Or fortitude be wanting to sustain,
Armies or kingdoms. We have heard a strain
Of triumph, how the labouring Danube bore
A weight of hostile corses; drenched with gore
Were the wide fields, the hamlets heaped with slain.
Yet see (the mighty tumult overpast)
Austria a daughter of her Throne hath sold!
And her Tyrolean Champion we behold
Murdered, like one ashore by shipwreck cast,
Murdered without relief. Oh! blind as bold,
To think that such assurance can stand fast!"
235,Emotion,CouragePoemsCourageFullyPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"Courage fully
How does only smile?
When you are troubled for a while
You are like any other man
No superman but only human'
You may keep happiness
And show it on face
But no one may notice
As you have your own voice
You may not love
And believe
In exposing woes
As life has many ways
It shows how to live
What to believe
And what to avoid
You can only add woes
So you have to make human efforts
With reports
To almighty daily
To encourage and grant courage fully"
236,Emotion,CouragePoemsCouragePoembyRichardBaird,"What does courage mean to me?
What does it mean to you?
To some, a single attribute, others, quite a few,
For courage is a lack of fear, inspired by faith and love,
Love of a person, place, or thing, faith in ""our Lord"" above.
In time of stress, the ""Lord"" provides, the strength to overcome,
It's courage! giving special drive! until the goal is won.
When danger threatens life or limb, it's courage to the fore,
A courage known by many names, as: daring! guts! and more.
Whatever name we give this trait, it's valiant! stout! and bold!
In action, it is fortitude, a wonder! to behold."
237,Emotion,CouragePoemsCrazyCouragePoembyAlmaLuzVillanueva,"Why do I think of Michael....
He came to my fiction class
as a man (dressed in men's
clothes) : then he came
to my poetry class
as a woman (dressed in women's
clothes, but he was still
a man under the clothes) .
Was I moved in the face of
such courage (man/woman
woman/man) ....
Was I moved by the gentleness
of his masculinity; the strength
of his femininity....
His presence at the class poetry
reading, dressed in a miniskirt,
high boots, bright purple tights,
a scooped-neck blouse, carrying
a single, living, red rose, in a
vase, to the podium (the visitors
not from the class, shocked-
the young, seen-it-all MTV crowd-
into silence as he's introduced,
'Michael....')   And what it was, I think,
was his perfect dignity, the offering
of his living, red rose to the perceptive,
to the blind, to the amused, to the impressed,
to those who would kill him, and
to those who would love him.
And of course I remember the surprise
of his foamy breasts as we hugged
goodbye, his face blossomed
open, set apart, the pain of it,
the joy of it (the crazy courage
to be whole, as a rose is
whole, as a child is
whole before they're
punished for including
everything in their
innocence.)

238,Emotion,CouragePoemsCourage2PoembyRobertWilliamService,"Ten little brown chicks scattered and scuffled,
Under the blue-berries hiding in fear;
Mother-grouse cackling, feathers all ruffled,
Dashed to defend them as we drew near.
Heart of a heroine, how I admired her!
Of such devotion great poets have sung;
Homes have been blest by the love that inspired her,
Risking her life for the sake of her young.
Ten little chicks on her valour reliant,
Peered with bright eyes from the bilberry spray;
Fiercely she faced us, dismayed but defiant,
Rushed at us bravely to scare us away.
Then my companion, a crazy young devil
(After, he told me he'd done it for fun)
Pretended to tremble, and raised his arm level,
And ere I could check him he blazed with his gun.
Headless she lay, from her neck the blood spouted,
And dappled her plumage, the poor, pretty thing!
Ten little chicks - oh, I know for I counted,
Came out and they tried to creep under her wing.
Sickened I said: 'Here's an end to my killing;
I swear, nevermore bird or beast will I slay;
Starving I may be, but no more blood-spilling . . .'
That oath I have kept, and I keep it to-day."

242,Emotion,CouragePoemsCourageCourageCouragePoembyEdgarAlbertGuest,"When the burden grows heavy, and rough is the way,
When you falter and slip, and it isn't your day,
And your best doesn't measure to what is required,
When you know in your heart that you're fast growing tired,
With the odds all against you, there's one thing to do:
That is, call on your courage and see the thing through.
Who battles for victory ventures defeat.
Misfortune is something we all have to meet ;
Take the loss with the grace you would take in the gain.
When things go against you, don't whine or complain;
Just call on your courage and grin if you can.
Though you fail to succeed, do not fail as a man.
There are dark days and stormy, which come to us all,
When about us in ruin our hopes seem to fall.
But stand to whatever you happen to meet—
We must all drink the bitter as well as the sweet.
And the test of your courage is: What do you do
In the hour when reverses are coming to you.
Never changed is the battle by curse or regret,
Though you whimper and whine, still the end must be met
And who fights a good fight, though he struggle in vain,
Shall have many a vict'ry to pay for his pain.
So take your reverses as part of the plan
Which God has devised for creating a man."
243,Emotion,CouragePoemsTheCourageOfShuttingUpPoembySylviaPlath,"The courage of the shut mouth, in spite of artillery!
The line pink and quiet, a worm, basking.
There are black disks behind it, the disks of outrage,
And the outrage of a sky, the lined brain of it.
The disks revolve, they ask to be heard—
Loaded, as they are, with accounts of ****ies.
****ies, usages, desertions and doubleness,
The needle journeying in its groove,
Silver beast between two dark canyons,
A great surgeon, now a tattooist,
Tattooing over and over the same blue grievances,
The snakes, the babies, the tits
On mermaids and two-legged dreamgirls.
The surgeon is quiet, he does not speak.
He has seen too much death, his hands are full of it.
So the disks of the brain revolve, like the muzzles of cannon.
Then there is that antique billhook, the tongue,
Indefatigable, purple. Must it be cut out?
It has nine tails, it is dangerous.
And the noise it flays from the air, once it gets going!
No, the tongue, too, has been put by,
Hung up in the library with the engravings of Rangoon
And the fox heads, the otter heads, the heads of dead rabbits.
It is a marvelous object—
The things it has pierced in its time.
But how about the eyes, the eyes, the eyes?
Mirrors can kill and talk, they are terrible rooms
In which a torture goes on one can only watch.
The face that lived in this mirror is the face of a dead man.
Do not worry about the eyes—
They may be white and shy, they are no stool pigeons,
Their death rays folded like flags
Of a country no longer heard of,
An obstinate independency
Insolvent among the mountains."

Courage overcomes fear
Fear accomplishes nothing
Faith stands in the face of fear
The brave make things happen!

Courage in old age is difficult
But courage we all need
And must try to have."

on a sleepful day
dozing at fire's side
near the finish of life's long ride,
will your soul once more awake
with a bitter remembrance of heart's break
to find the last thing tenderly true
is that little spark of love yet smoldering deep within you;
Stoop and stir the fire
those final embers of sweet desire
which are still aglow
burning on through the years of long ago,
with this concluding passion of a former time
you shall come to find
love is after all truly the bravest of the brave
the only one with enough courage to forever follow, even into
the grave."
250,Emotion,CouragePoemsCouragePoembyMargaretODriscoll,"'I brought some flowers'
I said to the nurse at the desk
She told me to take them home
Saying they weren't usually left
I said I'd like them in the room
Left up high out of the way
I said it was important
To have flowers during the stay
The next day on my visit
I spotted my bunch of flowers
They'd been placed in an old carton
The flower heads were drooping down
The hospital, like the carton
Was unsuitable, drab and old
The patients seemed like wilting flowers
They were sedated, sad and bored
I wrote a letter of complaint
Saying conditions there were cramped
The atmosphere there was despondent
Personal things got lost
There was little stimulation
No calm place to relax
Little chance to go outside
The grounds were even stark
Always try to find the courage
To speak up if there's a need
Stand up for what is right
Force authorities to take heed
We all have power to change things
To demand what is right
Keep in mind the wilting flowers
Don't give up the fight"

It takes courage to reach out to someone
To admit that you can't do it by yourself.
It takes courage to change
Change the way you looked at yourself
Change the way you react to situations
Change the way you view life itself.
Change the way you look at yourself
Recognize that you are a good person
Recognize that you have needs too
Recognize that you have feelings and that you hurt.
Change the way you react to situations
Look at the other person's side, not just yours
Look at the whole picture - know that all is not as it seems
Don't prejudge because you don't want others to prejudge you.
Change the way you view life
Learn that you cannot control things
Take chances, even when you are scared
Realize that life is an adventure - treat it as such."

There is no another chance
Once missed means lost at once

If you have done any mistake
That can't be retaken
Once you have hurt someone
That shall not be forgotten
At no stage you have shown regret
Or cause for bad fate
You might have gone too far
So is the result leading to fear?
Make no love bid again
Else it may add pain
She shall be troubled often
And life shall be turned into hell from heaven
Accept the fate
As it is still not late
You are responsible for mess
So gather courage to face"

since I first met you.
I know that the blessed,
are far and few.
I wish I saved myself
just for you.
As I write this poem,
only for you.
Something I thought,
I could never do.
I hope you accept this poem,
from me to you.
Times have seemed to change,
yet so many things remain the same.
There are so many things I have learned,
and so many pages that I have turned.
People are always changing,
trying to play the part.
Yet the only movement I felt,
is the one inside my heart.
The Gods have shined down on me,
to give me the courage to write to thee.
Yes or no, right or wrong,
my faith in us, will be forever strong.
Although my will was not enough,
to share my feelings before you left.
I respect our friendship the way it exists,
I can't help wondering if more could exist.
I think of the good times that we shared,
I never knew the burdens you bared.
I really wish I knew your pain,
I'd have done anything to take it all away.
There were so many things I wanted to say;
but here I am writing so far away.
Thousands of miles and an ocean away,
my feelings for you will always remain.
I haven't much to give,
only one life to live.
So little money and so few possessions,
a simple man with no obsessions.
For my hope carries me on,
and my faith makes me strong.
My heart and soul and love for you,
these are what I offer you.
With a soul,
as stong as you;
when I sleep,
I dream of you.
My faith and thoughts of happiness,
you're my sanity in this world of madness.
You remain in my thoughts everyday,
and I hope we will meet another day."

for granting peace.
The soul that knows it not
Knows no release from little things:
Knows not the livid loneliness of fear,
Nor mountain heights where bitter
joy can hear
The sound of wings.
How can life grant us boon of living,
compensate
For dull gray ugliness and pregnant
hate
Unless we dare
The soul's dominion? Each time we
make a choice, we pay
With courage to behold the resistless
day,
And count it fair."

That springs forth from the brow of pain, full-grown,
Minerva-like, and dares all dangers known,
And all the threatening future yet may bring;
Crowned with the helmet of great suffering;
Serene with that grand strength by martyrs shown,
When at the stake they die and make no moan,
And even as the flames leap up are heard to sing:
A courage so sublime and unafraid,
It wears its sorrows like a coat of mail;
And Fate, the archer, passes by dismayed,
Knowing his best barbed arrows needs must fail
To pierce a soul so armored and arrayed
That Death himself might look on it and quail."

Where do I get the courage to go out again?
To relax again?
To breathe?
Where do I get the courage to love again?
To be free again?
To cook again?
Or look at the blue sky again?
Where do I get the courage to write again?
To wipe out the bad memories?
And put the past behind?
Where do I get the courage to make new friends?
Or watch flowers grow in the garden?
Where do I get the courage to write a letter to you?
To save money again?
Or read books?
I find it

Courage is having fear

But being able to overcome it

In the greatest army in the world
Thank you for this courage
That lets us live free

It can happen so fast if you just believe
Believe in yourself and you'll be suprised
your more brave then you ever realized
Courage is something hidin inside
It makes you stronger than the highest tide
Courage means you can face your fears
That you're not afraid to shed some tears
In life without fear you can never be brave
You can't rescue a princess if there's no one to save

There can be no wrong if there is no right

Look deep inside and you'll find it too"

Or shall I lean into you
while dreaming of the
summers days of the old-
times when I was self assured?
With sadness I walk
this plank through valleys,
though I have not yet expired.

Exceeds his knowledge: neither is it lawful
That he should stoop to any other law."

And Winter's near.'
Serene it seemed to lift its head:
'The Winter's wrath I do not dread,
Because I am,' it proudly said,
'A Pioneer.
'Some apple blossom must be first,
With beauty's urgency to burst
Into a world for joy athirst,
And so I dare;
And I shall see what none shall see -
December skies gloom over me,
And mock them with my April glee,
And fearless fare.
'And I shall hear what none shall hear -
The hardy robin piping clear,
The Storm King gallop dark and drear
Across the sky;
And I shall know what none shall know -
The silent kisses of the snow,
The Christmas candles' silver glow,
Before I die.
'Then from your frost-gemmed window pane
One morning you will look in vain,
My smile of delicate disdain
No more to see;
But though I pass before my time,
And perish in the grale and grime,
Maybe you'll have a little rhyme
To spare for me.'"
269,Emotion,CouragePoemsTheQualityOfCouragePoembyStephenVincentBenet,"Black trees against an orange sky,
Trees that the wind shook terribly,
Like a harsh spume along the road,
Quavering up like withered arms,
Writhing like streams, like twisted charms
Of hot lead flung in snow. Below
The iron ice stung like a goad,
Slashing the torn shoes from my feet,
And all the air was bitter sleet.
And all the land was cramped with snow,
Steel-strong and fierce and glimmering wan,
Like pale plains of obsidian.
-- And yet I strove -- and I was fire
And ice -- and fire and ice were one
In one vast hunger of desire.
A dim desire, of pleasant places,
And lush fields in the summer sun,
And logs aflame, and walls, and faces,
-- And wine, and old ambrosial talk,
A golden ball in fountains dancing,
And unforgotten hands. (Ah, God,
I trod them down where I have trod,
And they remain, and they remain,
Etched in unutterable pain,
Loved lips and faces now apart,
That once were closer than my heart --
In agony, in agony,
And horribly a part of me. . . .
For Lethe is for no man set,
And in Hell may no man forget.)
And there were flowers, and jugs, bright-glancing,
And old Italian swords -- and looks,
A moment's glance of fire, of fire,
Spiring, leaping, flaming higher,
Into the intense, the cloudless blue,
Until two souls were one, and flame,
And very flesh, and yet the same!
As if all springs were crushed anew
Into one globed drop of dew!
But for the most I thought of heat,
Desiring greatly. . . . Hot white sand
The lazy body lies at rest in,
Or sun-dried, scented grass to nest in,
And fires, innumerable fires,
Great fagots hurling golden gyres
Of sparks far up, and the red heart
In sea-coals, crashing as they part
To tiny flares, and kindling snapping,
Bunched sticks that burst their string and wrapping
And fall like jackstraws; green and blue
The evil flames of driftwood too,
And heavy, sullen lumps of coke
With still, fierce heat and ugly smoke. . . .
. . . And then the vision of his face,
And theirs, all theirs, came like a sword,
Thrice, to the heart -- and as I fell
I thought I saw a light before.
I woke. My hands were blue and sore,
Torn on the ice. I scarcely felt
The frozen sleet begin to melt
Upon my face as I breathed deeper,
But lay there warmly, like a sleeper
Who shifts his arm once, and moans low,
And then sinks back to night. Slow, slow,
And still as Death, came Sleep and Death
And looked at me with quiet breath.
Unbending figures, black and stark
Against the intense deeps of the dark.
Tall and like trees. Like sweet and fire
Rest crept and crept along my veins,
Gently. And there were no more pains. . . .
Was it not better so to lie?
The fight was done. Even gods tire
Of fighting. . . . My way was the wrong.
Now I should drift and drift along
To endless quiet, golden peace . . .
And let the tortured body cease.
And then a light winked like an eye.
. . . And very many miles away
A girl stood at a warm, lit door,
Holding a lamp. Ray upon ray
It cloaked the snow with perfect light.
And where she was there was no night
Nor could be, ever. God is sure,
And in his hands are things secure.
It is not given me to trace
The lovely laughter of that face,
Like a clear brook most full of light,
Or olives swaying on a height,
So silver they have wings, almost;
Like a great word once known and lost
And meaning all things. Nor her voice
A happy sound where larks rejoice,
Her body, that great loveliness,
The tender fashion of her dress,
I may not paint them.
These I see,
Blazing through all eternity,
A fire-winged sign, a glorious tree!
She stood there, and at once I knew
The bitter thing that I must do.
There could be no surrender now;
Though Sleep and Death were whispering low.
My way was wrong. So. Would it mend
If I shrank back before the end?
And sank to death and cowardice?
No, the last lees must be drained up,
Base wine from an ignoble cup;
(Yet not so base as sleek content
When I had shrunk from punishment)
The wretched body strain anew!
Life was a storm to wander through.
I took the wrong way. Good and well,
At least my feet sought out not Hell!
Though night were one consuming flame
I must go on for my base aim,
And so, perhaps, make evil grow
To something clean by agony . . .
And reach that light upon the snow . . .
And touch her dress at last . . .
So, so,
I crawled. I could not speak or see
Save dimly. The ice glared like fire,
A long bright Hell of choking cold,
And each vein was a tautened wire,
Throbbing with torture -- and I crawled.
My hands were wounds.
So I attained
The second Hell. The snow was stained
I thought, and shook my head at it
How red it was! Black tree-roots clutched
And tore -- and soon the snow was smutched
Anew; and I lurched babbling on,
And then fell down to rest a bit,
And came upon another Hell . . .
Loose stones that ice made terrible,
That rolled and gashed men as they fell.
I stumbled, slipped . . . and all was gone
That I had gained. Once more I lay
Before the long bright Hell of ice.
And still the light was far away.
There was red mist before my eyes
Or I could tell you how I went
Across the swaying firmament,
A glittering torture of cold stars,
And how I fought in Titan wars . . .
And died . . . and lived again upon
The rack . . . and how the horses strain
When their red task is nearly done. . . .
I only know that there was Pain,
Infinite and eternal Pain.
And that I fell -- and rose again.
So she was walking in the road.
And I stood upright like a man,
Once, and fell blind, and heard her cry . . .
And then there came long agony.
There was no pain when I awoke,
No pain at all. Rest, like a goad,
Spurred my eyes open -- and light broke
Upon them like a million swords:
And she was there. There are no words.
Heaven is for a moment's span.
And ever.
So I spoke and said,
""My honor stands up unbetrayed,
And I have seen you. Dear . . .""
Sharp pain
Closed like a cloak. . . .
I moaned and died.
Here, even here, these things remain.
I shall draw nearer to her side.
Oh dear and laughing, lost to me,
Hidden in grey Eternity,
I shall attain, with burning feet,
To you and to the mercy-seat!
The ages crumble down like dust,
Dark roses, deviously thrust
And scattered in sweet wine -- but I,
I shall lift up to you my cry,
And kiss your wet lips presently
Beneath the ever-living Tree.
This in my heart I keep for goad!
Somewhere, in Heaven she walks that road.
Somewhere . . . in Heaven . . . she walks . . . that . . . road. . . ."

Make you feel sorry
For misdeeds
Or wrong feeds
It has deep impact
For acts
In mind
Forces to think as blind
It pinches
And reaches
To make you restless
With gloom on face
As rivers are now added with dirt
It has only bad odor to be smelt
Chemical waste adds woe
Where human beings can go?
Everything is polluted
Human values are diluted
Riots, unrest and murders are common
Not to speak of rapes on women
You cry in wilderness
No one hear even hiss
You curse but have no courage
Life shall move on with little courage"

And I will listen and memorise every word.
Point to me the easy solution
But remind me that all great things need courage.
I am afraid of rejection,
Please say that I might be missing True love
And that access to happiness

Convince me to hear the weak voice inside me
And not the loud one that is always there,
Help me to become a better listener of myself.
Protect me from comments that
I really don’t need to hear,
Teach me not to be influenced
By people that are more willing to judge
Than understand,
Take my hand and lead me to the pathway
That deep inside I know I should follow.
Blow courage into my face

275,Emotion,CouragePoemsCouragePoembyAnneSexton,"It is in the small things we see it.
The child's first step,
as awesome as an earthquake.
The first time you rode a bike,
wallowing up the sidewalk.
The first spanking when your heart
went on a journey all alone.
When they called you crybaby
or poor or fatty or crazy
and made you into an alien,
you drank their acid
and concealed it.
Later,
if you faced the death of bombs and bullets
you did not do it with a banner,
you did it with only a hat to
comver your heart.
You did not fondle the weakness inside you
though it was there.
Your courage was a small coal
that you kept swallowing.
If your buddy saved you
and died himself in so doing,
then his courage was not courage,
it was love; love as simple as shaving soap.
Later,
if you have endured a great despair,
then you did it alone,
getting a transfusion from the fire,
picking the scabs off your heart,
then wringing it out like a sock.
Next, my kinsman, you powdered your sorrow,
you gave it a back rub
and then you covered it with a blanket
and after it had slept a while
it woke to the wings of the roses
and was transformed.
Later,
when you face old age and its natural conclusion
your courage will still be shown in the little ways,
each spring will be a sword you'll sharpen,
those you love will live in a fever of love,
and you'll bargain with the calendar
and at the last moment
when death opens the back door
you'll put on your carpet slippers
and stride out."
276,Emotion,CouragePoemsCourageJesusCouragePoembyDenisMartindale,"When Christ prayed in Gethsemane,
His cup to be removed,
He still prayed with humility,
In hope that God approved...
Yet God saw Christ's disciples,
For whom their Lord must die,
With Christ's Scriptures in the Bibles
On which we all rely...
How could He then release His Son
From suffering and death?
How could He stop what must be done
To halt Christ's final breath?
God sent an angel, one alone,
To strengthen Christ again,
That He, by grace, could thus be known
As Christ, the Light of Men...
And thus, the Saviour's tears were wept,
Unseen by friend or foe,
Until He woke the ones who slept,
Fatigued and slow to go...
But then marched Judas, kissed the Lord,
Betrayed Him in that hour,
Despite the folly of reward
That brought no peace or power...
Thus Jesus judged by mortal souls,
Faced persecution's claws,
Submitting to its cruel controls,
Its twisted thoughts and flaws...
To feel the lash repeatedly
Upon His fragile frame,
Delivered then to Calvary
To bear our sinful shame...
The hours passed and darkness fell,
Men cowered in their fear,
As if the whole world went to Hell
With God's wrath oh so near...
Then death for Jesus came at last,
With victory assured,
While those who loved Him looked aghast
As blood from Him outpoured...
His lifeless body taken down,
His eyes closed in respect,
Then they removed the thorny crown,
The symbol of neglect...
Laid in a tomb as prophesied,
Awaiting Sunday's dawn,
God's precious promise, if Christ died,
Salvation would be born...
Fear not, believers, in the know,
God's promises come true,
Though into Earth each man must go,
God's grace is ever new...
The dead shall rise again one day,
The Rapture makes this known,
Then living saints are snatched away,
No more to stand alone...
That's why disciples preach God's grace,
Forgiveness here and now,
If we but look upon Christ's face,
The crown upon His brow...
His battered back, His hands, His feet,
His bloodstained lips and eyes,
We know God's pardon stands complete
If we would just be wise...

277,Emotion,CouragePoemsThePatriotsCouragePoembyHenryAbbey,"When our free land's great captain, Washington,
Was colonel in Virginia, ere the war
He led for Independence had begun,
A passing cloud obscured his rising star:
His sometimes frightful passions woke, and they,
Then unbroke coursers, had their fiery way.
For while between opposing factions there
The bloodless battle by the ballot rolled,
Into one's pride whem he had found unfair
He plunged a speech-wrought weapon, keen and cold;
And the hurt voter, with a blow unmeet,
Stretched his insulter senseless at his feet.
Forth hied the dread news, waxing as it went,
Fed by the food it gave to every tongue;
Uprose, wild-eyed, the wrathful regiment,
And idle swords and flintlocks were unhung,
And marshaled to the drum, whose speedy call
Was like the beating of the hearts of all.
When grief has rage soft pity turns to stone.
These loved their leader as they loved their land;
Aslant, like shining rain, their muskets shone,
And harsh the voice of vengeance pealed command:
'All foully slain our colonel lies, struck down!
On, comrades! Give no quarter! Burn the town!'
Meanwhile, the stricken was made whole again,
And, hurried by the townsfolk, rode to meet
The armed, excited torrent of fierce men
Advancing toward the small, elect'ral street;
And gladly holden in their wond'ring sight,
They pressed around him with unfeigned delight.
But vengeance is so inconsiderate,
Shorn of excuse it yet pursues its prey;
And all the soldiers, filled with gathered hate,
Were willed to leave black ruin on their way.
He charged them, lest the love he bore should cease,
To bate their wrath, and turn again in peace.
So they went back; and slowly he returned,
Chastising his quick passions ruthlessly;
For who, that with a foolish rage has burned,
Knows blame as bitter as his own may be?
But when red morn rolled up its splendid wheel,
Joy followed close on Sorrow's fleeing heel.
For then betimes, a lark-blithe letter flew
Out of a heart where kindness brooded warm;
But to the voter's short and narrow view
It was the white-winged augury of storm;
It asked a meeting only, yet he heard
Of challenge and of duel in the word.
For who could know that one would be so bold
To face and brave the time?-in that it meant
That each his honor on his sword should hold?
The voter straightway to the other went,
And Washington, with courage strong and grand,
Held forth his prudent and heroic hand.
And in his love of truth, sublime and glad,
To him who struck him down he made amends:
'If with the satisfaction you have had
You are content, oh, let us then be friends!
For, looking back on our affray with shame,
I feel that I alone have been to blame.'"
278,Emotion,CouragePoemscouragePoembyairaolayvar,"It was said that courage is the mastery of fear…
But not the total absence of it…
I was afraid to love,
I was afraid of pain.
I was afraid of big responsibilities,
I was afraid of having serious priorities…
I was totally afraid to fall for you.
But I need the guts; I need the courage because I do.
I need the courage to be brave,
To learn to face my life ahead…
The courage to learn to live with you…
And I know…
That the courage and the strength that I need would really comes from you!

279,Emotion,CouragePoemsUndauntedCourageLewisAndClarkPoembyMadamAnonymous,"Let me tell you a story,
A story of 28 great lives,
Of hope, of enterprise,
An inspiring story,
Of adventure, of glory
Clark, hero of Kentucky
Lewis, loyal to the President
With a melancholic strain,
Sallied into the unknown
The Corps of Discovery’s
Body and brain.
Commanded by
The Son of America
Equipped with bravery,
A Giant,
Who dared throw off
The yoke of King’s slavery.
Lured by a dream
Of the virgin land,
Set forth to discover
The Northwest Passage,
This ragtag band.
Armed with
Gifts, guns, stores
And Rush’s thunderbolt,
Barrels of Whiskey
To quell shiphand revolt.
They sailed
The mighty Mississippi
Christening from the start,
Madison, Gallatin, Jefferson
A young republic
Honored from their heart.
The journey into the unknown
Was fraught with surprise,
Would they ever win
And claim their prize?
The west was
Pristinely beautiful
Rockies, Prairies, Great Plains,
With death as their friend
Persevered without complaints.
Many a times voted
In American tradition,
Strengthened by discipline
Their leaders’ demanding condition.
Enriched science with
Idyllic flora and fauna,
Won over the
Mandans, Lakotas, Crows
With their gentle persona.
Sacagawea, the Shoshonee
Stood with many a males,
York, the slave
Was devoted to the cause
Of keeping the Corps a-sail.
After long patient winter
And portage over their backs,
They finally stood atop
The Continental Divide
Gauging their stocks.
Dumbstruck
At the expanse ahead,
They pressed on
Into the unknown
And chose starvation instead.
Finally, at Fort Clatsop
In misty Columbia Gorge
The  Shangri-La was claimed,
Thanks to the defiant few
The Wild West had been tamed
It took 4 years
For this momentous journey,
Of adventure, of enterprise,
Of great lives,
Of glory,
That inspires
With its singular story.

282,Emotion,CouragePoemsWhatsCouragePoembyEliseoRivera,"Here's a question thats always on the back of your mind
With an answer nearly impossible to find
What is courage?
People often mistake courage for bravery
Like sumone that looks like a celeberity
Bravery is having little or no fear
Like a dying person knowing the end is near
Courage is overcoming what makes you tremble and shiver
Like knowing you might die and still donating your liver
But courage wouldn't exist without fear
Like intoxication wouldn't exist without beer
So I guess now the REAL question is clear
Not What's Courage but What's Fear?

283,Emotion,CouragePoemsCourageAndConfidencePoembyAkhtarJawad,"At about 0100 hours,
While I was sleeping,
My phone rang,
A naughty girl asked,
Is your refrigerator running?
I was not fully awaken,
I replied, let me check,
It's running, I said,
Please lock the doors,
Otherwise it will run away.
At this stage I was fully awaken,
I checked the number,
It was stranger to me,
Next day I tried to find out,
As to who was she,
But I failed.
During the night,
I called on that number,
At 1300 hours,
It was busy,
I tried a few more times,
It was busy every time.
Next day in the morning
At 1100 hours,
I dialed that number,
After continuous rings for a few minutes,
The girl attended the call and said,
Hell with Alexander Graham Bell,
You awoke me at the odd hours,
I remained awaken for the whole night,
And now you disturbed me,
Well, who are you?
The same man,
Whom you disturbed,
Yesterday, at 1300 hours,
The real odd hours!
I am sorry.
She disconnected the phone.
The same night,
At 1300 hours,
I received another call,
Budha ghar per hay?
(Is the old man at home?)
Yes but he doesn't want to talk to you,
Why?
He likes to talk with the girls,
Having beauty and charms.
Your complexion is dark,
You are fat like an elephant,
You are too ugly.
How dare you? I am beautiful.
Impossible, a beautiful girl,
Instead of talking on phones,
Talks face to face,
Because she possesses,
Courage and confidence,
That you don't have.
No more calls."

286,Emotion,CouragePoemsBonCouragePoembyAmyGerstler,"Why are the woods so alluring? A forest appears
to a young girl one morning as she combs
the dreams out of   her hair. The trees rustle
and whisper, shimmer and hiss. The forest
opens and closes, a door loose on its hinges,
banging in a strong wind. Everything in the dim
kitchen: the basin, the jug, the skillet, the churn,
snickers scornfully. In this way a maiden
is driven toward the dangers of a forest,
but the forest is our subject, not this young girl.
She's glad to lie down with trees towering all around.
A certain euphoria sets in. She feels molecular,
bedeviled, senses someone gently pulling her hair,
tingles with kisses she won't receive for years.
Three felled trees, a sort of chorus, narrate
her thoughts, or rather channel theirs through her,
or rather subject her to their peculiar verbal
restlessness ...    our deepening need for non-being intones
the largest and most decayed tree, mid-sentence.
I'm not one of you squeaks the shattered sapling,
blackened by lightning. Their words become metallic
spangles shivering the air. Will I forget the way home?
the third blurts. Why do I feel like I'm hiding in a giant's nostril?
the oldest prone pine wants to know. Are we being   freed
from matter? the sapling asks. Insects are well-intentioned,
offers the third tree, by way of consolation. Will it grow
impossible to think a thought through to its end? gasps the sapling,
adding in a panicky voice, I'm becoming spongy! The girl
feels her hands attach to some distant body. She rises
to leave, relieved these trees are not talking about her."

288,Emotion,CouragePoemsCoffeeCouragePoembyMarkRSlaughter,"The bitter coffee kicked;
I shook and then I licked
My lips and gave a sigh.
Shattered eyes encouraged,
I nearly had envisaged
Waking up an eye.
Another sip; a jolt –
Not unlike a bolt
Of wattage from the mains.
My sockets under strain,
I tried it once again:
Aha! The light, the searing white –
My God, the bloody pain!

So wonderful this world is
So strange the life is
And so good God is
Her broad smile lights up the stage
Where she dances without legs
Not a story but a fact of one’s life’s page
People say this world is pitiful
But she says it beautiful
On her world frowns
But she takes it smiles of crown
Her hands are now legs
Her body she whirls, curves and shakes
With living music when plays
Looks like lilies in the dew
And daffodils at play
Rain, hail and snow
Will never turn aside
And my disability, she says
Through dance and smile
I can turn aside
Live a graceful life
And God’s judgement I abide
This is courage, very inspiring
Springing forth from great suffering
For after every sunset there’s a dawn fair
And I call it courage in a wheelchair………….."
291,Emotion,CouragePoemsToStillHaveTheCouragePoembyRICBASTASA,"to still have the courage
to go on living
despite
all the odds of a life
that seems
to refuse life's
limited offers
of survival
to dream of you
and still keep on dreaming
of you
when reality
on the other hand
flatly tells
that you were gone
that in fact
you were gone
23 years ago
i wake up
only to  find out that
life is cruel
and insensitive
courage tells
to go on
living life
both as a duty
and a right
that life is beautiful
that  courage
is indefatigable"
292,Emotion,CouragePoemsWithCouragePoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"With courage
I don't know more
But adore
In heart
As fact of religion art
It is matter of faith
And shall remain in each count of breathe
With cruel joke of death
But where is remedy o sooth?
I bow down my head
And read
In recognition
Only one name for excitation
I feel happiness
On face
With so much of satisfaction
To have read about it in religion
I fear nothing
When remember something
The Kara stone fills me with courage
I live cheerfully with an age"
293,Emotion,CouragePoemsHonorAndCouragePoembyJuanOlivarez,"In Japan, they write on rice paper,
In America, we write on the sides of buildings.
In Japan they honor their elders,
In America, we rob them on buses,
And abuse them.
In Japan there is great love for their country.
In America, people are refusing to stand,
For the national anthem.
In Japan, men are volunteering to die,
Without a second thought,
To give up their lives,
To save their fellow citizens.
Oh yes, you'll say, the Japanese are great,
At dying, at suicide missions.
But is that the point?
Shouldn't the point be,
The Japanese love their homeland,
The Japanese love their own people,
The Japanese love their way of life,
The Japanese love their traditions,
Love, honor, respect, courage,
Nobody writes on Japanese walls.
Offenders are quickly and severely dealt with.
Wouldn't you volunteer also?
Maybe not.
Honor, and courage,
Seem to be,
In short supply,
Stateside.

294,Emotion,CouragePoemsCouragePoembyJeffreySpahrSummers,"It takes courage to admit defeat
to lay the weapons down
to declare oneself unarmed
before anyone else gets hurt
it takes courage to succumb

to surrender to the frankness
of the unknown you know don't
want to be held prisoner exactly
perhaps someone will just kill me
then it won't really matter anymore

296,Emotion,CouragePoemsHaveYouGotTheCouragePoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"Have you got the courage?
To deal with personal baggage
Have you got the courage?
To embark on a new voyage
It is crystalline common knowledge
Many a woman born with courage
Has had piffling or no privileges
To travel through life’s hideous passage
And stand stubbornly by her message
Highs but not the lows, If you one of those
Have you got the courage, to end your marriage?
Have you got the courage, to face your fears?
Or experiment with new ideas
Have you got the courage, to say you love me?
And maturely accept if I glee or flee
Have you got the courage, to repair all self inflicted damage
Before your life becomes wastage
Have you got the courage, to learn a new language?
Can you manage with new knowledge?
Have you got the courage, to admit your gruesome rage?
Instead of acting like an actress on stage
Courage comes with age
When priority is no more image
Courage comes with change
Evolving from leadership shortage
In life, at this stage
Courage is something you must engage
It must be clearly visible in every page"
297,Emotion,TrustPoemsITrustInJesusPoembyMichaelPJohnson,"Before this body turns to dust
Before this world I leave
Upon The Lord I’ve placed my trust
Upon The Rock I’ll cleave
I’ve placed my trust in Jesus Christ
God’s Son of flesh and bone
The innocent Lamb sacrificed
I trust His word alone
I trust He chose for man to die
Then rose again to reign
That as God’s Seed He’d multiply
His flock when born-again
I trust His blood can cleanse the soul
I trust His blood can save
His very name can make us whole
And save us from the grave
I trust in Jesus’ loving care
I trust He bore my shame
I trust the love He came to share
Remains today the same
I trust the pardon Jesus bought
Can save this wretch from hell
I trust Salvation’s true report
My Saviour had to tell
Although the devil’s out to harm
Though Satan’s he’s out to kill
I trust my Lord’s almighty arm
I trust His righteous will
I trust my life to Christ The Lord
I trust in Heaven’s Door
I trust in God’s Almighty Sword
I’ll trust Him evermore…"
298,Emotion,TrustPoemsTrustPoembyjenniferjanepryce,"Trust me now I have to say
Like breaking dawn creeps into day
Like rainbows chase the pot of gold
Like thoughts as words need to be told
Trust me like there’s no tomorrow
Hold me close and let no sorrow
Come between us now and ever
Let us always stay together
Words I’ve spoken place no blame
But words untold say just the same
Conviction to be held and frozen
In your mind for ever chosen
Trust me now and take this poem
To your heart not as a token
Blessed am I for knowing you
I am forever trusting you.
This one is for my dear friend - who knows who he is!"
299,Emotion,TrustPoemsTrustMePoembyMaryNagy,"What have I done to lose your trust?
Can you please explain to me...
Why is it that you seem to think
I'm trying to break free?
I don't yearn for my freedom.
I feel free in your arms.
Don't let those thoughts control you.
I'm aware of all lifes harms.
You'll never be forsaken.
I'll always remain true.
It hurts me when you don't believe...
I'm forever loving you.
I feel the pain you're feeling
but, I am not to blame.
It's just jealous emotions.
I love you just the same.
I won't give in to jealousy.
You know me way too well.
My loyalty won't falter
surely you can tell.
You don't need to be worried
of things you cannot see.
You gained a wife forever
the day you married me."
300,Emotion,TrustPoemsTrustAndBetrayalPoembySuzySkoda,"You say you love me, and I want to believe again.
We said I do, in better or worse, that was not true.
When I look in the mirror all I see is a lie and hurt.
I go to sleep in pain, I wake up in pain.
When I am not near you I wonder, I hate this doubt.
I had trust, I had faith in us. I gave, you took.
This is not what I thought marriage would be like.
I thought you were the one person,
I could laugh with, talk with, cry with.
I thought we had it all, And now its cold and dark.
Once the trust is gone, do we ever get it back.
I hate this, I hate this feeling of not being enough.
I always thought love was enough,
I finally opened my heart and soul,
Perhaps that's what life is all about,
All about the people you hold close,
And the time they will betray you.

Because my trust for you
Is fueled by the love you have

304,Emotion,TrustPoemsNeverTrustALobsterPoembyTerryDonovan,"Never trust a lobster,
He may have a charming smile
But underneath he's ruthless
And saves everything to file.
The sea and sand and sunshine
Will have you feeling good
And trusting everybody -
But are you sure you should?
Prawns and shrimps keep secrets,
Mermaids never tell
But lobsters love to gossip
(And they make things up as well) .
Crabs give you sidewise glances
And might seem quite aloof
But you can trust them at a pinch,
They very seldom goof
But never trust a lobster.
I did - now look at me
In Davy Jones's locker
At the bottom of the sea.

305,Emotion,TrustPoemsSonnetTrustGodAlwaysPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"God helped me wade through problems galore but,
My thoughts are pessimistic to the core;
I live in luxury: Yet, want a hut!
I wonder what the future has in store!
The tougher part of life’s journey seems o’er;
I long to have reprieve prolonged in time;
I yearn to be a regular Church-goer!
Lord, Usher in a favorable clime!
The future looks fearsome and depressing!
The Lord who stood by me will not fail me;
He knows when to bestow a great blessing;
My human heart and mind appear wary!
I trust in God and move full steam ahead;
Despite life’s thorns, God gives a rosy bed!

306,Emotion,TrustPoemsSomeoneYouCanTrustPoembyBobGotti,"God is Faithful and God is Just, God is someone you can trust.
When in a trial simply be still, as God works out His Perfect Will.
He is God and from the start, He’s working to prepare your heart.
When you are tried, you will see, God is molding you for Eternity.
The Lord our God is loving friend, and concerned about our end.
Fear not which way He takes, for God above makes no mistakes.
And It cannot be your concern, when God’s Will you can’t discern.
If your path takes a sudden turn, He may be helping you to learn.
God may take you to a place, that you need His Awesome Grace.
When you do not understand, with your heart just trust His Hand.
When His Hand seems to depart, you can always trust His Heart.
Christ will not forsake you friend, He’s here to see you to the end.
The Lord is taking us one by one, down a path to reflect His Son.
And God fills us along the way, with Christ’s likeness day by day.
So as we travel this path of life, we shall shine for His Son Christ.
You can trust in Christ Jesus, for He indeed shall never leave us.
I trust in the One who died for me, so that I could live for Eternity.
My trust friend is in my Creator, Who is now my Lord and Savior.
Who can know or love me more, than Jesus Christ our dear Lord?
To get to Heaven it’s a must, that in The Lord you place your trust.
How could you not trust the one, who chose to give His Only Son,
To a dying world as a sacrifice, so men could inherit Eternal Life?
Why would I choose not to trust, the One who chose to die for us,
So through His death I could be, with Christ my Savior Eternally?"
307,Emotion,TrustPoemsTrustYourselfPoembyJeffFleischer,"After G-d, trust yourself the most.
Believe in yourself more than in others.
Always be confident, but forever humble.
Know who is who and what is what.
Close friends are the critical ones.
Gold has its value,
But life is priceless.
Stones are precious,
But never more than a parent's love.
Each day attempt to unlock the door to wisdom
With the key that is your mind.
Be comfortable with yourself,
And you will never be alone."
308,Emotion,TrustPoemsNationalTrustPoembyTonyHarrison,"Bottomless pits.  There's on in Castleton,
and stout upholders of our law and order
one day thought its depth worth wagering on
and borrowed a convict hush-hush from his warder
and winched him down; and back, flayed, grey, mad, dumb.
Not even a good flogging made him holler!
O gentlemen, a better way to plumb
the depths of Britain's dangling a scholar,
say, here at the booming shaft at Towanroath,
now National Trust, a place where they got tin,
those gentlemen who silenced the men's oath
and killed the language that they swore it in.
The dumb go down in history and disappear
and not one gentleman's been brough to book:
Mes den hep tavas a-gollas y dyr

309,Emotion,TrustPoemsJustTrustHimPoembyLauraHull,"Just trust Him when  you can't see,
Just trust Him and believe
For He is with you through your shadows of doubt.
He is with you and will bring you out.
Just trust Him, when the loneliness chills,
Just trust Him, and follow His will.
He will surround you with blankets of love,
He will whisper from the heavens above.
Just trust Him and You will find
That He carries you through the storms of time.
Just trust Him and finally be
Free
As He lifts you up
And helps you to soar
higher and higher.
You are not alone.
Lean upon the Lover,
As you walk through the desert.
Lean upon the Lover,
Trust in Him alone.
For when you lean on Him,
You learn to see
How things are meant to be.
He carefully guides you by still streams
And brings you through valleys low,
Until you know and discover
The depths and the heights
Of His great love.

The things you say excite me,
but I’ve heard them said before:
sweet words dry up too soon,
replaced by shouts and threats.
I want you, but can I trust you?
The way we touch excites me,
but I’ve known that touch before:
caresses stop too soon,
fingers curl into fists.
I want you, but can I trust you?
The love you give excites me.
What is this love
that accepts me for who I am,
that allows me to grow,
to blossom,
to be me,
without fear,
without pressure,
without limits?
Is this real love at last,
or are you a fantasy,
a better liar than the others?
I am so sore, so scarred, so scared.
Be gentle with me.
One day I may learn to trust you.
For now, you’ll have to trust for both of us.
But I want you."

314,Emotion,TrustPoemsNeverTrustAWomanPoembyMaryNagy,"Never trust a woman.
When will I learn this rule?
Each time I let my guard down
I'm left looking like a fool.
They look right at you smiling
pretend to be your friend
secretly recording every word
to repeat like there's no end!
They smell vulnerabilities.
They sense you will confide
your deepest, darkest secrets
and then you'll want to hide...
They sneer with twisted lips
and glowing eyes of hate.
You never saw it coming
this turn your ''friends'' call fate.
They run in packs like wolves.
They'll eat your weakened soul.
Don't turn your back on one of them
or you'll have to pay the toll.
They'll wait till you are comfortable
then hit you in the knees.
They use your heart against you
and do just what they please.
I won't say that it hurts.
I've been hurt too much before.
It takes more than betrayal
for me to cry and hit the floor.
I need to heed my warning
and remember when I say...
Never trust a woman
cause her claws don't go away!"

slowly, when u said you hate to rush,
yes, he followed all your decisions,
to recognize the flow you follow,
so that he can love you the way you wanted,
with a pure heart, without any bad intentions.
you were very lucky to have had fallen in love with him,
cuz every second you spend with him, he counted,
cuz when you're with him, all the grey clouds are nowhere to be seen,
cuz when giving you his everything, he never hesitated.
you and him, started out wonderfully,
so perfect that people was so envy of your relationship,
everybody, even your best of friends you thought you could believe,
spread rumours that caused you to trust them more than him,
he was so dissapointed even though he loved you, it seems.
you slapped his face for something he didn't do,
then he ran back to his home and cried cuz thinking of you,
he thought you trusted him as much as he did,
he thought he had loved you as much as you needed.
at the end, you found out that the rumours were untrue,
sad and worried that he will hurt himself,
you drove so fast in hopes of finding him,
but suddenly, a huge and fast truck, you ran into,
and the last thing you saw was his beam.
you let the memories fade away,
but that was what he always hope not to happen,
he still misses you until today,
and hopes to see you then in heaven..."

Oh! You're asking why?
Search and you will discover
That trust once told you a lie.
Trust got me in a cab,
Took me to a downtown shrine,
His priest ready to stab,
To drain and drink my blood like wine.
Trust put a gag over my mouth
Made me perjure as to my whereabouts,
Just to lure me to his den
With nobody knowing my where and when.
Trust took me like Isaac
Placed my innocent conscience on a pyre
To melt my ego like plastic
But alas flames divorced his fire.
Trust came back to seek my face,
With his guffaw reduced to a tear;
And now so out of place
Is an emotion that I once thought dear."

I trust you, more than words can say,
Faster than the wind can sway,
I trust you.
When we sit together and think,
I know a lifetime can pass away in a blink,
Do you know, the world is spinning round,
But my head is still on the ground.

Your the one for me today,
Your the closest to heaven that I can see,
Believe me when i say you mean the world to me."

Just for people to become what they must.
Best friends going against you,
Jealous and try'n  to pull you down,
And just a couple years earlier,
You  swore a friend is what you found.
Men and women cheating,
Breaking each others hearts,
Abusing one another,
In all different parts.
I find it hard to open up,
And even if I say I do,
Deep down inside,
I will never trust you.
Not because of who you are,
Not 'cause your a boy or a girl,
I just see it not right to love,
When you get no love from this world.
I will always prefer to walk so-lo,
Dealing with ash or with dust,
I will never risk getting a broken heart,
Untill you answer what is trust."

somewhere overhead
(of damocles or other, praying
for release from dread.)
nor crouching tiger poised to ravage
unsuspecting prey.
trust is never quite so savage
as to  act this way.
nor like some zealous guard on duty
anxious for a crime.
nor jealous ever is of beauty,
never out of time.
but trust is true abandon knowing
quite beyond a doubt
no boundaries beyond which going
love be found without.
and finds it's utter freedom measured
not in proof - but rest.
and needs no guarantee that treasures
won't be repossessed.
like carefree children at the ocean
dancing in the waves,
trust is liberty in motion.
nothing is more brave!"

Still sometimes I just don't know what to do

or wondering if I'm in love
I believe that trust is the only thing that can make this work
Because without a hundred percent we're bound to get hurt
I think you do trust me but it's not all there
so I wonder if you're in love
Because to trust in someone with every trace of your being
Without seeing or hearing or even fearing the worst
Looking through what hurts to just put all your trust in me
and without that it's hard for me to believe
That this will last eternally
Now don't get me wrong and certainly don't count me out
Without a doubt I have so much hope and I trust that
You will trust in me eventually. maybe you just don't see
That your trust is all I need."

Who can I trust when my world falls apart?
When everyone's lying and deceiving
Who can i trust with my heart?
Should I trust no one but myself?
To keep my life I must be circumspect.
Keeping quiet, telling no one but God,
He already knows the effect.
I'll never believe the people again,
The people who have hurt me once before.
The saddest part is I'll never be trusting
Of anyone any more.
How can I be certain that I won't be hurt?
How could someone hide themselves so well?
When everyone's lying and deceiving,
How can anyone tell?"

Find someone to blame for their own mess.

But then it becomes too late to make amends.
And this is how making fools of others begins.
And instead of getting offended,
People like this end up call themselves...
Either allies or friends.

Through all the grim doubts that bemock the soul,
When in the amazement of far-reaching throught,
We list the labourings that for ever roll
Like dubious thunders through those clouded regions
Where night and destiny the counsels keep
Of Time developing his shadowy legions.
And when I ve stood upon some hazardous steep
Of speculation—heaving up its bare
And rugged ridge high in the nebulous air
Of endless change, and thence tremendously
Throwing its shadow, like a blind man’s stare,
Out through the dread unknown—deep trust in Thee,
O God! Hath likewise been my refuge there."
329,Emotion,TrustPoemsTotalTrustLostPoembyRudyHossam,"This is the story of the total trust
You gave me and I lost
I was a bad thing
I never used to think
More than once I dropped
And you helped me on my feet up
And then again I didn't care
And walked in that very same dark track
You pushed me to show me the light
And that there is a better track
Straight, bright and no one can dropp in it
In front of you I walked in it
But still the dark was what I wished
You saw me walk to the light
You gave me your total trust
You never thought I'll go back to the dark
After I knew that there was light
But too bad I did
You somehow saw me in it
And all the trust you gave me I lost
Because you saw me dropp again
But it was a bigger drop
You told me help yourself out
This time I really regret
But you said to late
You've dropped
And only you can help yourself out
Because if I help you
You'll return back to it
That very dark scary track

Never wanting that dark life

And give me Ur forgiveness
After I take Allah's."

Tense and beating, full of fear.
I keep with me your everlasting love,
and bless the day God sent you from above.
You remain my angel and I feel that I must,
tell you that within you, you have my trust.
My love is the tide, your soul is the shores,
you have my heart, do I have yours?
I'll belong to you till the very end,
and you will forever stay as my lover and friend.
It has been so good like this from the start,
so darling please, trust me with your heart."
331,Emotion,TrustPoemsTrustPoembyPoetryGuy,"We had trust, but I blew it
I said things I didnt mean
Said I'd do things I had no intention of doing
But intentions dont matter when trust has been smashed.
Words can hurt even without actions
But can my actions repair
The hurt done by my words?
I want to say Im sorry
I want to show you Im sorry
I want to regain your trust
I want you."

The verge of death's grave.
To sleep, weep in the mudded dirt.
You take away my body’s tattered shirt.
I’m no slave, you wretched tyrant.
You loud- mouthed, fat- bellied master.
It is not you, whom I fear, no.
It’s the Lord above, who sent me here.
He sent me to this troubled land.
To stand  ground, dig deep my soul.
It is he whom I fear  most of all.
Without him, I will never stand tall.
Take what you will, beat me as you must.
I will endure, to the Lord I give my trust.

340,Emotion,TrustPoemsTrustYourselfPoembyDipikaPathania,"I wonder why hurt exists but then think
'Yeah its good it does exist...! ! '
Since life is not always fair to all us humans
We need to be prepared to face the bad that comes
Sometimes dreams shatter, wishes remain unfulfilled
Yet we need to stay focused to accomplish what is not reached....
Its not bad to fall down but yes it is when you refuse to get up
Rise up and face the truth this is most difficult which many dont follow up
Some wonder whether what they are doing is right or wrong
But i guess we must leave this to God and keep working all along
When everything seems unclear and no ones around to hear you
All you need to know is the 'SELF' that lies within you.....
You yourself have the strength to make things really work
Correct the wrong and be focused only on your work
Dont lose hope when you find yourself at lost
You 'Yourself' can make changes in all measured cost
Then you will realize what lies within you
TRUST YOURSELF in all situations and it will surely help you..! !"

deep down within, i hope real hard
deep down within, i scream and shout
deep down within, i cant help but cry
deep down within, i think theres no way out
for what once had has now been lost
for that i blame myself
for childish as this thought may sound
for that long gone i sorely miss
trust we had so long ago.
trust which i destroyed.
trust is what we need again
trust to make us strong
all i can give is a simple word...sorry
all i can give is a simple thought...happiness
alli can give is a simple emotion...love
all i can give is a simple thing...my heart
i just need you to forgive me...
without you i have nothing i want to give

He doesn’t understand?
My trust in him.
Emotionally
Sexually
Mentally
Physically
Financially
Socially.
I can
No longer
Trust him
With my dreams.
Without trust
What is left?
Ask me now
The eternal question -
What is Love?
And I will tell you.
Now I have lost it,
I know what it is ….
Love is being able to
Give your total trust
Without fear or hurt. –
And if someone
Truly loves you,
They will trust you
Equally in return.
I can now see
It is a long time
Since he really
Loved me."
343,Emotion,TrustPoemsTwoWayTrustPoembyFaySlimm,"For wet-nosed welcomes and four-pawed hugs, none
Can match the dog. Fur-bound coat, eyes so wide
And velvety melt our  heart and, 'will' gone
We most willingly succumb.  Keen to hide
Our love affair, we fake a careless style
And tone our voice to suit, but when tail wags
As if to break while greeting us, we smile,
Even when there's muddy floor, bedraggled
Dog just glances at us wistfully.  More
Than that, a quiet whine, defined as
An apology is all we need.  As for
Two-way trust it grows, and if by chance passed
Over for a newer canine pal, our
First love pines, two-way trust declines, then dies.
A dog's love is of moment and of now.
That's all the canine heart can feel applies.
Thus, well or sick, lonely or in pain, fairly
Constant, man's best friends let us know they care."

a path for me to walk, ...

I trust you father to instill
a roadmap for my life
that steers me towards the rightous few
and spares me pain and strife
I trust you father to remind
me of my own free will,
that pitfalls lie within my path,
that I must climb uphill
I trust you father to accept
that sometimes I grow weak,
and thrist for waters of this world,
and other love I'll seek
I trust you father to forgive
my sins in Jesus' name,
and when I die my soul will rise,
and salvation I can claim
I trust you father"

he could recite every line by heart
He was only eight, too.

I knew it had gone
- the fifty dollar note
It was definitely in my purse last night
I remember checking
and I knew who'd taken it
What to do...
Confront and condemn?
(and guarantee more lies)
Confront with understanding?
(he's a good little actor)
Pretend I haven't noticed?
(and let him get away with it)
No way!
that night after story....
Sweetheart, I've been thinking...
What?
Well, some kids bring money to school, don't they?
Dunno...
To buy lunches and stuff.
no answer
I guess sometimes you wish you had some?
Maybe...
To buy stuff yourself, I mean...
S'pose so...
Would this help?
I handed him ten dollars
he blushed
Thanks mum

next morning
the fifty dollar note
was back

My heart is empty,
Its cold as ice,
As it reach to break,
It leaks out of water,
That water drips and slips away,
That trust,
That moment,
All within those you have broken,
I may not trust you or your friends but that don’t mean we can’t be friends,
Just friends without that trust,
You have to work your trust with me,
You have to make me understand why should I ever trust you again,
You have to repair that broken trust,
You have to work hard,
That don’t mean be hateful towards me,
Just show me that I can trust you once more."
347,Emotion,TrustPoemsTrustPoembysaadattahir,"Chugging train at a station stops
Passengers hop
Passengers Shop
Baggage is dropped
In dingy passages darkness gropes
Meandering through some clammy slopes
Trust delivered on time in tranches
Like autumn’s bare branches
Balancing act at the stop
String of tears water a crop
Another time another sop
One more shop
Whistler signals carry you on
On the fly another pawn
Another dawn
Frenzied throes of compulsive lust
Blocked by trust?
Blown to dust?
Not just…stay!
But no on the trodden, well worn way;
another stop if I may!
Gloom beset and gathering doom.
Cannot you be in a shared room!
Its just…only a lonely tomb
Trust is but a bubble thing;
a silent burst, just a hollow ring.
Baleful swallow in a cemetery twitters.
Profane an hushed silence glitters.
No more views an no more cues.
Time to alight an pay your dues

349,Emotion,TrustPoemsSmallIsTheTrustWhenLoveIsGreenPoembyRobertLouisStevenson,"SMALL is the trust when love is green
In sap of early years;
A little thing steps in between
And kisses turn to tears.
Awhile - and see how love be grown
In loveliness and power!
Awhile, it loves the sweets alone,
But next it loves the sour.
A little love is none at all
That wanders or that fears;
A hearty love dwells still at call
To kisses or to tears.
Such then be mine, my love to give,
And such be yours to take:-
A faith to hold, a life to live,
For lovingkindness' sake:
Should you be sad, should you be gay,
Or should you prove unkind,
A love to hold the growing way
And keep the helping mind:-
A love to turn the laugh on care
When wrinkled care appears,
And, with an equal will, to share
Your losses and your tears."

displays one gift beyond the scope of Man.
How dangerous the skies - for men, and birds -
how soiled the air, if wings were in Man's span!
Suppose that every species made extinct
by Man, the guardian of all things that live,
deprived us (as indeed it may..)   by dint
of mindlessness, of something God's mind gives?
I watch the spider, humble in my praise:
self-spinning tightrope walker; engineer;
the knower of all Nature's weathered ways
and bold explorer on the winds that veer:
Nature spares the spider Man's wild mind;
should mind in Nature rest, there's more to find."

Don't you dare.
You'll soon see,
That you shouldn't have cared.
Why did you place,
The trust on my lap?
Should have let it an empty space,
And then you wouldn't have been in my trap.
You should listen to me when I tell you,
Trust me not 'cause I will disapoint.
I'll leave you all torn up and blue,
And I'll beat you trust and disjoint,
You heart as it will rust,
'Cause I will be the one,
Who betrays your trust.
And that is when your trust is done."

we all must feel
when working anywhere.
As soon as employers

everyone with the same brush.
You begin to loose the loyalty
that people crave so much.

355,Emotion,TrustPoemsTryBeforeYouTrustPoembyThomasVaux,"To counsel my estate, abandoned to the spoil
Of forged friends, whose grossest fraud is set with finest foil;
To verify true dealing wights, whose trust no treason dreads,
And all too dear th'acquaintance be, of such most harmful heads;
I am advised thus: who so doth friend, friend so,
As though tomorrow next he feared for to become a foe.
To have a feigned friend, no peril like I find;
Oft fleering face may mantle best a mischief in the mind.
A pair of angel's ears oft times doth hide a serpent's heart,
Under whose grips who so doth come, too late complains the smart.
Wherefore I do advise, who doth friend, friend so,
As though tomorrow next he should become a mortal foe.
Refuse respecting friends that courtly know to feign,
For gold that wins for gold shall lose the selfsame friends again.
The quail needs never fear in fowler's nets to fall,
If he would never bend his ear to listen to his call.
Therefore trust not too soon, but when you friend, friend so,
As though tomorrow next ye feared for to become a foe."

Trust God.
When you pray
And it seems
That God is not
Answering your prayer.
Think on His ways
How He wants you empowered.
How He wants you spiritually blessed.

Remember He loves YOU.
And your adequacy
To know how
He chooses to bless
And answer your prayer.
Is so far
Beyond your comprehension.

Better than you know
How to ask.
Your asking is never equivalent
To His answering.
For His answering
Is always beyond your request.
Know God
Trust God.
His blessings are always
A continuance to your prosperity.
You may ask for one thing
But God wants you fulfilled
He gives you two.
To multiply anything of itself
Gains you nothing.
Know God
Trust God.
For in search of His answers
You may find the blessing
You hoped for
And the one you really wanted.
But then look again
You will find the very thing
Which was all you really needed.

Beyond what we ask.
For neither we the intelligence
Nor the aptitude
To even guess
What He will do for you."

Can we trust our eyes?

Without trust what do we have?
Can we trust our landlords?
Can we trust our children?

I trust He chose for man to die
Then rose again to reign
That as God’s Seed He’d multiply
His flock when born-again
I trust His blood can cleanse the soul
I trust His blood can save
His very name can make us whole
And save us from the grave
I trust in Jesus’ loving care
I trust He bore my shame
I trust the love He came to share
Remains today the same
I trust the pardon Jesus bought
Can save this wretch from hell
I trust Salvation’s true report
My Saviour had to tell
Although the devil’s out to harm
Though Satan’s he’s out to kill
I trust my Lord’s almighty arm
I trust His righteous will
I trust my life to Christ The Lord
I trust in Heaven’s Door
I trust in God’s Almighty Sword
I’ll trust Him evermore…"
377,Emotion,TrustPoemsSonnetHaveTrustFaithInGodPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"Have trust in God and things will turn out right;
Have faith in God and mountains melt like ice;
Have trust in Him- temptations you can fight;
Have faith in Him and Life will become nice.
Have trust in God for He can do all things;
Have faith in God who solves problems we can’t;
Have trust in Him who selects Leaders/ Kings;
Have faith in Him who feeds Ants /Elephant.
Have trust in God for He is our Friend true;
Have faith in God who remains always near;
Have trust in Him who brings the rain and dew;

Have trust in God who is so kind yet terse;
Have faith in Him who rules the universe!

as night to the sky
Looking into  the darkness
as  the cries of  the pain
Falling as the dew

And I shine in wetting

tunes to the faith of love

380,Emotion,TrustPoemsToLiveMerrilyAndToTrustToGoodVersesPoembyRobertHerrick,"Now is the time for mirth,
Nor cheek or tongue be dumb;
For with the flow'ry earth
The golden pomp is come.
The golden pomp is come;
For now each tree does wear,
Made of her pap and gum,
Rich beads of amber here.
Now reigns the rose, and now
Th' Arabian dew besmears
My uncontrolled brow
And my retorted hairs.
Homer, this health to thee,
In sack of such a kind
That it would make thee see
Though thou wert ne'er so blind.
Next, Virgil I'll call forth
To pledge this second health
In wine, whose each cup's worth
An Indian commonwealth.
A goblet next I'll drink
To Ovid, and suppose,
Made he the pledge, he'd think
The world had all one nose.
Then this immensive cup
Of aromatic wine,
Catullus, I quaff up
To that terse muse of thine.
Wild I am now with heat;
O Bacchus! cool thy rays!
Or frantic, I shall eat
Thy thyrse, and bite the bays.
Round, round the roof does run;
And being ravish'd thus,
Come, I will drink a tun
To my Propertius.
Now, to Tibullus, next,
This flood I drink to thee;
But stay, I see a text
That this presents to me.
Behold, Tibullus lies
Here burnt, whose small return
Of ashes scarce suffice
To fill a little urn.
Trust to good verses then;
They only will aspire,
When pyramids, as men,
Are lost i' th' funeral fire.
And when all bodies meet,
In Lethe to be drown'd,
Then only numbers sweet
With endless life are crown'd."
381,Emotion,TrustPoemsTrustPoembyVictoriaSypniewski,"Take a look inside my heart
Look deep
The truth will be clear
I'm terrified of you
My trust has been broken before
I couldn't shield myself from the pain
But, are you different
Will you be the one to make it alright
Please forgive me for this
I can't trust you
Even if I wanted to
Prove to me you're real
Show me you're true
Tell me you'll always be there for me
Maybe I can put my trust in you"
382,Emotion,TrustPoemsTrustMePoembyVictorOsorio,"I knew the truth about me
Without any facts
I knew things would turn
Bad luck always comes back
I fell for the lies
Thinking someone could care about me
Still I didn't feel right
Until things become clear
Before you, I was sad and dejected
With you, I almost started to smile
Because of you, broken by picture
Trust me, I've been here
I let myself fall
Trust me
Nobody loves me at all
The worst is over now
I make myself bleed
My mood doesn't let me feel pain
But blood is everywhere, just like rain
I'm going away now
Trust me, it's for the best."
383,Emotion,TrustPoemsTrustNoOnePoembyGaryDiamond,"This
Is good advice.
If you trust
Too much too early
Prepare to be raped entirely.
Oh we've been there.
Well and truth, been there.
Got away sometimes
Formed a better plan
Made more sense of it all.
You're fucking wide.
Your fucking wife is a whore.
She just jumped on you like a predator
Bore you kids may be.
But she just sat on you
Because you were the best thing about at the time
Now she roams free
And because you are so weak
She'll wear down her chances
And circle right back to you
You will let her
Because you have no balls.
Trust no one.
I never have.
Even the parents that bore me.
I love them
But total trust
Never give them.
Trust no one.
Out there are many
Who love to prey on innocence.
To steal the wallet that opens too easily.
To pry out the change even the smaller sides."
384,Emotion,TrustPoemsLoveIsTrustPoembyAlexandriaValena,"Love is trust
even when it comes to lust.
That feeling of butterflies
dont make up for all your lies.
You lose the trust when you cheat
it makes me feel defeat.
Trust in love
because its as rare as a dove.
When we get in a fight
in the middle of the night
dont tell me that you love me
that doesnt make everything all right.
Love is Not sex
expecially when its in a text.
Phone sex dont count
I hardly know what its about.
Screw your fondling
it dont do a damn thing.
Love is sticking together
no matter what the weather
Love is holding me tight
in the middle of the night."
385,Emotion,TrustPoemsTheTrustPoembyRobertWilliamService,"Because I've eighty years and odd,
And darkling is my day,
I now prepare to meet my God,
And for forgiveness pray.
Not for salvation is my plea,
Nor Heaven hope,--just rest:
Begging: ""Dear Father, pardon me,
I did not do my best.
""I did not measure with the Just
To serve my fellow men;
But unto levity and lust
I loaned my precious pen.
I sorrow for the sacred touch,
And though I toiled with zest,
Dear God, have mercy, in-as-much
I did not do my best.
""I bless You for the gift you gave
That brought me golden joy;
Yet here beside the gentle grave
I grieve for its employ.
Have pity, Lord,--so well I know
I failed you in the test,
And my last thought is one of woe:
I did not do my best."""

And broken lies the glass-mantle of fame;
My body's wick too half-burnt and sadly;
Heart's fuel gone, in hopelessness and shame!
I ponder if these are my earth's last days,
As weary lie my spirit and my will;
While Death's cold-sneer is laughing at my face;
I feel miserable, so extremely ill!
The God in me goads me to carry on;
For earth's verdicts are not infallible;
New Hope could come with every morning's Dawn;
Nothing to God is ev'r impossible!
I continue to live as God demands,
He holds my hour-glass and its falling-sands!"

388,Emotion,TrustPoems609BetrayedTrustPoembyMelvinaGermain,"I  found a damsel in distress
Wearing  a tattered torn aqua dress
tears flowed sadly down her face
She was a picture of beauty and grace
I held her close and gently squeezed tight
I told her everything would be alright
A fallen  priest fondled and raped this teenage girl
Took away her innocence, introduced her to the real world
I was much older than this gentle creature
But I knew I could never leave her
We married and moved away from Montreal
Perhaps a new city would break the fall
She was introduced to many new friends her age
But her eyes displayed an inside rage
A dismal, dark and gloomy day
Would etch  pain in my heart to stay
Today I found my gentle, quiet dear
Hanging from our kitchen chandelier
Her mind was ruined by a heartless act
She could no longer face the gruesome facts
Now she lays in quiet sleep
In God’s hands, her soul will keep.

389,Emotion,TrustPoemsTrustIsFoundPoembyJeffRushton,"Trust in man was lost today
Trust in man that is never quite regained
Trust was lost when you started to betray
Trust was lost when you didn't care enough to say
Trust was lost when you used me as your social play
Trust was lost when you hurt me in front of family and those that used me as prey
Trust was lost when you denied me of my greatest day
Trust was lost when you ignored my loves and hates
Trust was lost when you borrowed and never repaid
Trust was lost when I gave and you treated me as a slave
Trust was lost when I cared and all you wanted was pay
Trust was lost when I loved and you treated me as the fool
Trust was lost when I had a great passion and you treated it as a ration
Trust was lost when I looked in your eyes and saw the truth, but you continued to lie
Trust was lost when I asked you to help and you never even tried
Trust was found and everything turned around
When I lowered my head and looked up to the Masters stead
Trust was found and with it came the sound of the beginning to an eternal round
For on that day trust was found
Trust becomes sound, only when man looks around and realizes that
The only trust to be found is in him-self and the one that gave us ground
TRUST WAS FOUND!"

A light that shines in your eyes
Bright and flickering

Shone through all
Like stars at nightfall
Trust is
When you cheer me and keep
Me laughing through tears
Better then anyone

Making me feel like Marilyn
Whilst I feel like
Liza Minelli on a drip
Trust is
Everything I feel with you
Everyday in love
Always
That is what

396,Emotion,ChangePoemsWindsOfChangePoembyasmabahrainwala,"A solitary stunted bud
In a barren garden
Of repressed desires
Parched to the core
And in need of love
To rejuvenate its being
Blossomed at the very hint
Of the touch
Of the friendly West Wind
Trumpeting the arrival of Spring
In its seemingly eternal
Autumnal existence.
Imagine this,
If a single hint of breeze
Could bring to life
This long dead bud
What would an Eternal Spring
Do to it?
Caress it out of its
Vegetative existence?
Fill it with fragrance?
Promise that it would never ever
Let autumn set in?
Or is it too early for the hopeful bud
To surmise the intent of Spring?

Our destination earth,
We ride upon the solar winds
Until the hour of birth
When scattered, weary travlers
Who've journeyed from afar
Begin their incarnation
On this cold and dying star;
What used to be so beautiful,
So vibrant green and blue
An oasis for the many
Has been wasted by the few,
What purpose in this torture
Of the motherhood of man?
What evil child will desecrate
His home because he can?
We've overstayed our welcome
It's time for us to leave
And after our destruction
Will no man be left to grieve?
Sweet children of the universe
With hearts so pure and free
Release this star from bondage
With love's celestial key!
Return these souls to heaven
Wrap this earth in slumber deep,
Awaken us with dreaming,
Let your love inside  us creep
Then as buds upon the branches
Of Life's tree on some spring morn'
We shall blossom into beauty
And this earth shall be reborn."
399,Emotion,ChangePoemsSeaChangePoembyRobertWilliamService,"I saw a Priest in beetle black
Come to our golden beach,
And I was taken sore aback
Lest he should choose to preach
And chide me for my only wear,
A ""Gee"" string and a brassière.
And then I saw him shyly doff
And fold his grim soutane,
And one by one his clothes take off,
Until like any man
He stood in bathing trunks, a sight
To thrill a maiden with delight.
For he was framed and fashioned like
Apollo Belvedere;
I felt my heart like cymbal strike
Beneath my brassière.
And then the flounce of foam he broke,
And disappeared with flashing stroke.
We met. 'Twas in the billows roll.
Oh how he sang with joy;
But not a hymn, - a merry troll
With gusto of a boy.
I looked, and lo! the priest was gone,
And in his place a laughing faun. . . .
Today confession I have made.
The Father's face was stern,
And I was glad that in the shade
Mine he could not discern . . .
He gave me grace - but oh the bliss,
The salty passion of his kiss!"
400,Emotion,ChangePoemsChangePoembyEllaWheelerWilcox,"Changed?  Yes, I will confess it – I have changed.
I do not love you in the old fond way.
I am your friend still – time has not estranged
One kindly feeling of that vanished day.
But the bright glamour which made life a dream,
The rapture of that time, its sweet content,
Like visions of a sleeper’s brain they seem –
And yet I cannot tell you how they went.
Why do you gaze with such accusing eyes
Upon me, dear?  It is so very strange
That hearts, like all things underneath God’s skies,
Should sometimes feel the influence of change?
The birds, the flowers, the foliage of the trees,
The stars which seem so fixed, and so sublime,
Vast continents, and the eternal seas, -
All these do change, with ever-changing time.
The face our mirror shows us year on year
Is not the same; our dearest aim, or need,
Our lightest thought, or feeling hope, or fear,
All, all the law of alternation heed.
How can we ask the human heart to stay,
Content with fancies of Youth’s earliest hours?
The year outgrows the violets of May,
Although, maybe, there are no fairer flowers.
And life may hold no sweeter love than this,
Which lies so cold, so voiceless, and so dumb,
And will I miss it, dear?  Why, yes, we miss
The violets always – till the roses come!"
401,Emotion,ChangePoemsAChangeOfLuckPoembyTheresaAnnMoore,"It is said that a four leafed clover
Brings good luck to those that find
In the middle summer I looked all over
For a magic leaf of four… a rare kind
Then one day I discovered a quad-leaf
Inconspicuously growing in the lawn
Good luck would mine… this was my belief
Tomorrow will improve starting at dawn
The next morning I brushed my teeth
Then splashed warm water on my face
I did not notice the cat beneath my feet
Tripped and fell with no time to brace
Standing with bruised knees I wondered
How can this happen, how is it possible?
What twist of chance caused this blunder?
In too much haste… I was accountable
Then I realized that maybe I was fortunate
It least I did not break my bones in the fall
Hope for luck, turned out to be a distraction
Maybe an uneventful day is the luckiest of all…

This feeling of desolation and madness
Swirling inside my voids when I look at you
Confused as to why my mind is fantasizing
Why my body is materializing
Why my emotions are stabilizing...
Has this been here all along or just began?
Have I always longed for you or only now?
Did I wish for this forever or did it start today?
Was I supposed to take this forbidden step over you
Make that fateful choice into the unknown
Open myself to breaking completely again
With you I have no ideas
No where to run to
No place to hide...
So maybe I'll just lay my head on your shoulder
Or whisper that I'm looking at you
In a light that only now appeared to my eyes
And it's beautiful."

Freedom, a memory enhanced with a casing of non truth

A blend compelling, to the core of your ignorance

Changes teach us that there is more to life,
It shows us our goals and the way to strive.
Its like a dropp of golden Sun in the darkness
Illuminating the thoughts and directing it to harness.
Accelarating and enlightening as it comes;
Failures and sucess all it sums.
Providing an intermediary betwixt past disappointments and future aspirations;
Welcoming change is the only way to reach the life's destination.

The key is to accept what you cannot change."

I struggle,
I am not nurtured,
Nor cared for,
I learn the harsh lessons,
Of Life,
Alone.
Then,
Satisfied in my growth,
Having learnt my lessons,
I gain maturity,
I am ready,
For change.
I build walls,
Around myself,
To protect,
This change,
For change I must.
I hang,
Waiting patiently,
Change must occur,
For what else is left?
I push now,
I am impatient,
I have waited,
Long enough,
It is time.
I’ll show this world,
That I can survive.
One side of me,
Is exposed to the world,
Then another,
Slowly at first,
For I do not wish to shock,
Only to dazzle.
Released am I,
Free,
Free to show myself,
In all my glory,
In all my splendor.
For I have changed,
I am now,
Who I’m meant to be,
I am finally me.
So, fear not change,
It comes naturally,
Be brave,
Learn well,
And when,
The time comes,
Be free."

411,Emotion,ChangePoemsPollutionAndClimateChangePoembyMichaelShepherd,"First,  of nature's course, it was the birds;
for theirs the air, above and over all;
knowing by intuition without need of words
as providential, seasoned, sure
as sparrow's fall;
and knowing too
how much to trust to men
who do not even trust each other.
It was, of nature's course, the snowy eagle
entrusted with the task:
the only bird who may look straight into the sun; and thus
to whom that message might be given, to ask,
to pass on to his lord; the only bird
whose plumage may reflect the sun's majestic rays,
and live; perhaps to bring a message back.
As to the message - was it just a sprig
of leaves from tallest tree - polluted, withered, black as crow?
or was it something inner in the words
as spoken on the flight from wintry sun to warmth, or
warmth to Northern spring?
They watched, the conference of the silent birds,
while snowy eagle, like the teepee's early morning smoke,
ascended higher, higher, into the sun's great eye,
which never man - eagle alone - may see;
and... do birds hope?
Or as the twilight falls upon the earth, accept
that what shall be, shall be?"

Said the sun to the moon,
You cannot stay.
Change

Says the fields to the grass,
Seed-time and harvest,
Chaff and grain.
You must change said,
Said the worm to the bud,
Though not to a rose,
Petals fade
That wings may rise
Borne on the wind.
You are changing
said death to the maiden, your wan face
To memory, to beauty.
Are you ready to change?
Says the thought to the heart, to let her pass
All your life long
For the unknown, the unborn
In the alchemy
Of the world's dream?
You will change,
says the stars to the sun,
Says the night to the stars."
413,Emotion,ChangePoemsSeasonsChangePoembyShelleyLBaxter,"On a lazy Sunday afternoon,
the sun shone so brightly...
appearing like a large blazing
iridescent quarter.
.
Hovering over the quiet city,
the glowing sphere gave so much,
life to the dull muted blue sky,
so much warmth-and promise!
To the old woman whose body
earlier had been aching...
and whose mind was sluggish...
this was just what she needed.
The sun and the feeling that summer
was arriving soon whisked away
the memory of her 'Winter' days,
suspended in mid-air-it gave her Joy!
While Glistening into the windows
of her tired and weary soul...
she stood up in one brisk move
on the rickety weathered balconey.
Although Her perennials had not yet
surfaced, Myra began removing foliage
from her cracked chipped window box...
all while smiling and singing happily.
Taking it all in...breathing deeply,
yet softly, the old woman  realized,
she had made it through again,
another year passed-without her late friend.
Written on February 28th 2008."

From the depths of my heart,
For promoting me, at last,
To Professor cadre.
If it had been earlier,
It would have been better;
It could have been better,
But it doesn’t matter.
Yet, was it in my fate?
I’as unique till date;
Was it because of others?
Whom I thought were brothers!
What’s past is past;
When things looked aghast;
But we know truth will last;
Though the world is fast.
But I am very glad,
That I’m no longer sad;
My image that seemed bad,
Is better now on pad.
Not a visit, I’ad made;
I call a spade a spade;
And I’as ne’er afraid,
Nor did I look for aid.
And all I know is this,
‘A man aright has bliss’
Though cruel be world’s kiss;
And things do go amiss.
When God is by my side;
And I in Him abide;
And truth is my great pride;
The stormy waves, I ride!
But why such things happen?
And why men jump the fen?
All fruits one day ripen;
All wells, one must deepen.
Why men choose easy routes?
Can one wear always boots?
We eat our parent’s fruits;
And go about in suits!
But shouldn’t we change for good?
Too much is poison-food;
And why to fret and brood?
And why to wear a hood?
Our stay on earth is short;
And life can well abort;
Lets change our minds and heart;
And practice genuine art.
All men are just brothers;
Lets think about others;
Some beasts do need feathers;
A thing with time weathers.
Don’t believe what some say;
Each man will have his day;
We go in God’s way;
Or for our blunders pay!
Lets make this world of men,
And things uneven, even;
Lets make the earth, Heaven;
In time that’s God-given!"
416,Emotion,ChangePoemsChangeFromTheInsideOutPoembyBobGotti,"The more that some Christians change, the more they remain the same,
For many people who claim to be saved, are only Christians in name.
Christianity is not simply a religion for man to deal with strife,
But it's God personally reaching down to man to offer him new life.
Change in one's life is not simply an option for each Child of God,
For we were commanded to leave behind the path we once had trod.
Although we live in the world, we're not to be of the world we're in,
For God's desire for us would be hindered if we get entangled in sin.
Christians are sealed by The Holy Spirit until the day of redemption,
You are then set apart for the work of The Lord, with no Exemption.
Our lives belong to God, as He purchased us with the blood of Christ,
Christ is where we place our trust, as we become a living sacrifice.
And it's to the patterns of this world we are not to be conformed,
Instead it's through the Word that renews, we are to be transformed.
For all in Christ, the old passes away as we become a New Creation,
And God, who has reconciled us, give us a ministry of reconciliation.
So our lives should now be used to reach others with God's Salvation,
It should be our compassion to reach every tribe, tongue and nation.
So today is the day to let The Lord inside and really make a change,
And just like John the Baptist my friend, you will never be the same.

Thy pyramids built up with newer might
To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;
They are but dressings of a former sight.
Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire
What thou dost foist upon us that is old,
And rather make them born to our desire
Than think that we before have heard them told.
Thy registers and thee I both defy,
Not wond'ring at the present, nor the past,
For thy records, and what we see doth lie,
Made more or less by thy continual haste:
This I do vow and this shall ever be:
I will be true despite thy scythe and thee."

419,Emotion,ChangePoemsAChangePoembySugarBear,"Sometimes I wake up hating the world
Caring for no one in it
Doing only what stress reviled
And ignoring what isn’t
Pain flows through my body
Quite often, frequently
Sulking becomes a hobby
And draws attention to me unpleasantly
Regretting my decisions
Wishing I were someone else
Somebody with vision
Anyone but myself
Hating everything about me
Wishing I were done
Leave my past behind me
And just, run
Hiding forever behind every tree
So I blend in with the shadows
Enabling you to see
How I scandal
Ripping at my hair
Pinching at my chest
Unable to bare
Till my last breath
Waiting for another place
Of which you can roam
Wishing for a teary face
When I'm gone
I’ll just let you know
You have no idea
The things I wish to let go
Are STILL right here"

No Notice gave She, but a Change—
No Message, but a Sigh—
For Whom, the Time did not suffice
That She should specify.
She was not warm, though Summer shone
Nor scrupulous of cold
Though Rime by Rime, the steady Frost
Upon Her Bosom piled—
Of shrinking ways—she did not fright
Though all the Village looked—
But held Her gravity aloft—
And met the gaze—direct—
And when adjusted like a Seed
In careful fitted Ground
Unto the Everlasting Spring
And hindered but a Mound
Her Warm return, if so she chose—
And We—imploring drew—
Removed our invitation by
As Some She never knew—"

What will happen to change?
Will change change as all things?
Or will it develop immunity
And embrace hypocrisy?
Will change resist change
And go against its doctrinaire?
Why, will change change not
Should nothing be permanent, even change?
Since change is also a thing.

Our world changes daily by seconds
Our lives in the roller-coaster of time
The noon gives way to the moon
The dawn turns dusk
At intersections of these:
One enters, another exits
One moans, another mourns
One rejoices, one regrets
In the spate and space of time;
A jungle becomes a haven
The oblivious became renowned
Riches become ruins
All on the altar of change"
425,Emotion,ChangePoemsVillanelleOfChangePoembyEdwinArlingtonRobinson,"Since Persia fell at Marathon,
The yellow years have gathered fast:
Long centuries have come and gone.
And yet (they say) the place will don
A phantom fury of the past,
Since Persia fell at Marathon;
And as of old, when Helicon
Trembled and swayed with rapture vast
(Long centuries have come and gone),
This ancient plain, when night comes on,
Shakes to a ghostly battle-blast,
Since Persia fell at Marathon.
But into soundless Acheron
The glory of Greek shame was cast:
Long centuries have come and gone,
The suns of Hellas have all shone,
The first has fallen to the last: --
Since Persia fell at Marathon,
Long centuries have come and gone."

With parting or tears;
Death will not alter it,

Crown'd with frail flowers forth comes the baby year.

And thou yet in that frost
Which flower and fruit hath lost,

Look to that Heaven which never night makes black,
And there at that immortal sun's bright rays,
Deck thee with flowers which fear not rage of days!"

Their food-habits and dressing styles may change;
Their ways of talking, walking, laughing, change;
But Bible’s words are true and never change!
Man’s outlook and his sense of values change;
The weather, climate, seasons also change;
The water of rivers and seas may change,
But Scripture’s words are true and never change!
Man’s needs in life and ambitions may change
Man’s occupations, moral values, change
Man’s goals and approaches also may change,
But Holy Scripture’s words will never change.
The devils too, their tempting tactics, change;
God’s love for man is same and will not change."

“Why, certainly sir! ”

He showed me

“Or, if Sir
may not mind me commenting
this deep purple pain
... suits you Sir! ”
“Don’t you have any

“Or at best

“Or at least

“Happiness is so...old hat! ”
“Happiness is...how you say

clutching an expensive
purple heart

And that it would
hang in the wardrobe
Mocking

So, now
I don’t have a mind

And the mouth is thin.....

In heart and memory
Is as radiant, as youthful,
As the day I met you.

434,Emotion,ChangePoemsChangePoembyAnnBeard,"Our world forever changes every second every day.
Nothing halts the pass of time; old age will have its way.
each mighty cliff or ancient tree will suffer the same fate
life seems just an experiment, a transitory state.
The planet earth its fertile soil, the mysteries of heaven,
all forever changing in more ways  known to man.
From the wonder of first breath to surrender of the last,
Time becomes the enemy devours all moments past.
Nothing is more fragile than the spirit of mankind,
as good and evil battle in each subconscious mind.
change is hardly noticed until friends or lover’s die,
then we weep and fear mortality while we say goodbye.
Change has made us who we are, a visitor, a guest
we dine on nature’s beauty babies suckle at the breast.
A child will learn and grow maybe someday take my place
But In very different world, for I alone lived in this space.

436,Emotion,ChangePoemsTheCourseOfLifeTimeAndEventsAndTheProcessOfChangePoembyMerlinArchivilla,"Time or fate may separate friends, lovers,
But friendship or love that's true will ever
Thenceforth continue to live forever,
True love conquers the odd with its power.
As time passes by, things change with the time,
Every moment, hour, day, month, and year,
All things have their turn to change with the time,
Life, time, and events change with the years.
Everyone, everything, have a time and day,
A time to change, end, begin a new day,
Change is life, the course of life everyday,
All things change, and we change with them all days.
Only the Eternal one is constant,
All things in the universe, inconstant,
But despite it all, love is important,
The world may change, but true love is constant."

If you throw in enough sweet sugar;
So lemons are the fruit of the day,
So sour your lips start to pucker -
Just make lemonade
A tall glass in the shade
Will refresh on a hot summer day;
So your garden has grown green tomatoes,
That just won't turn red in the sun -
Fry them up in a pan
Make some relish to can
What a wonderful change of taste!
Whenever life throws you a curve ball
When you were expecting a hit -
Then you should be guessin'
You're learning a lesson................................
It's time for a change of scenery."

That today we need to understand,
Changes changed us into mediocrity.
Our good values of sharing a hand
To those who need our sympathy,
Like the poor and needy of the land
Who  never had behold the beauty
Of living a life without strife upon
Had turn into a deaf advocacy.
Useless war against humanity,
Erred by poverty across every land,
And the burning fire of other's tyranny,
besets nations to remain us one
Need to be stop to save humanity.
In our own little way, we can be
Agent of change with a conviction
that by the power of our poetry
We can bring peace, love and union

443,Emotion,ChangePoemsNoChangePoembyivororivorehogg,"In days of yore men preened and posed like peacocks to impress
the haute monde with their quality: Put on a brave display,
although often a hollow sham. Which only served to say.
Fine feathers do not make the man, although they may express.
His vapid personality and general uselessness
Today image is everything, it is the modern way.
We kow tow to celebrities, a silly game we play
We have not learnt lessons from history. That image matters less
Than well proven ability and sterling honesty.
We let ourselves be taken in by what spin doctors say.
We are to ready to accept as truth, the clever lies
Which at first glance appear to be completely bias free.
Well designed publicity by those who earn high pay.
by portraying as honest men: Thieving rogues in disguise."
444,Emotion,ChangePoemsTheChangePoembyEllaWheelerWilcox,"She leaned out into the soft June weather,
With her long loose tresses the night breeze played;
Her eyes were as blue as the bells on the heather:
Oh, what is so fair as a fair young maid!
She folded her hands, like the leaves of a lily,
'My life, ' she said, 'is a night in June,
Fair and quiet, and calm and stilly;
Bring me a change, O changeful moon!
'Who would drift on a lake forever?
Young hearts weary - it is not strange,
And sigh for the beautiful bounding river;
New moon, true moon, bring me a change! '
The rose that rivalled her maiden blushes
Dropped from her breast, at a strangers feet;
Only a glance; but the hot blood rushes
To mantle a fair face, shy and sweet.
To and fro, while the moon is waning,
They walk, and the stars shine on above;
And one is in earnest, and one is feigning -
Oh, what is so sweet as a sweet young love?
A young life crushed, and a young heart broken,
A bleak wind blows through the lovely bower,
And all that remains of the love vows spoken -
Is the trampled leaf of a faded flower.
The night is dark, for the moon is failing -
And what is so pale as a pale old moon?
Cold is the wind through the tree tops wailing -
Woe that the change should come so soon."

Because I didn’t take wear the right clothes.
Well I think its time to spread these wings.
You never helped me.
You never listened to what I had to say.
You never made me feel good.
You made me feel like dirt.
But still I call you my friend.
I’m going through this with you.
But it feels as though I’m alone.
I can’t call you when he’s leaving.
His bags all packed.
Because he has found a better more perfect family.
So as tears flood my eyes.
They pour down my cheeks leaving puddles on the floor.
Barely being able to speak.
I reach for the phone.
Dialing your number.
Trying to reach someone to tell me everything will be fine.
Reaching out before I die.
Pulling that trigger with the barrel pressed against my head.
I finally get you.
And yet you tell me just to go to bed.
Pain and hurt rushes over.
I’m alone.
There’s no one here to talk me to sleep.
No one to help me through.
I’m stuck here in hell.
To never return back.
Can’t you just lend a hand.
Someone please help.
As I think that it is over.
I’ve watched betrayal from my father.
And I don’t want you do to the same.
Finding a more perfect and better friend.
Because I was there for you when your grandma died.
Now I’m dying but your not here.
I need you to be here.
Beside me.
Making me feel better.
But no your not.
Because I’m your old friend.
Im sorry that I didn’t wear the right clothes.
I didn’t have the ins.
I’m not sorry that I was your friend.
You were like a sister.
But now you won’t even open up your arms to me.
I feel hopeless.
This trigger is pressed even harder to my skull.
Just.Pull.The.Trigger.
This house has come crashing down.
The lies.
The tears.
The screams.
Why won’t you just say 3 little words.
Everything.
Is.
Ok.
This is my last cry for help.
Just reach out.
As I’m reaching out now.
I’ve given you all the signs.
And you know too.
But you won’t reach for me.
I’m going.
Slowly I’m going further to that black hole.
Why can’t you just help?

446,Emotion,ChangePoemsAChangeOfMenuPoembyBanjoPaterson,"Now the new chum loaded his three-nought-three,
It's a small-bore gun, but his hopes were big.
""I am fed to the teeth with old ewe,"" said he,
""And I might be able to shoot a pig.""
And he trusted more to his nose than ear
To give him warning when pigs were near.
Out of his lair in the lignum dark.
Where the wild duck nests and the bilbie digs,
With a whoof and a snort and a kind of bark
There rose the father of all the pigs:
And a tiger would have walked wide of him
As he stropped his tusks on a leaning limb.
Then the new chum's three-nought-three gave tongue
Like a popgun fired in an opera bouffe:
But a pig that was old when the world was young
Is near as possible bullet-proof.
(The more you shoot him the less he dies,
Unless you catch him between the eyes.)
So the new chum saw it was up to him
To become extinct if he stopped to shoot;
So he made a leap for a gidgee limb
While the tusker narrowly missed his boot.
Then he found a fork, where he swayed in air
As he gripped the boughs like a native bear.
The pig sat silent and gaunt and grim
To wait and wait till his foe should fall:
For night and day were the same to him,
And home was any old place at all.
""I must wait,"" said he, ""till this sportsman drops;
I could use his boots for a pair of strops.""
The crows that watch from the distant blue
Came down to see what it all might mean;
An eaglehawk and a cockatoo
Bestowed their patronage on the scene.
Till a far-off boundary rider said
""I must have a look -- there is something dead.""
Now the new chum sits at his Christmas fare
Of a dried-up chop from a tough old ewe.
Says he, ""It's better than native bear
And nearly as tender as kangaroo.
An emu's egg I can masticate,
But pork,"" says he, ""is the thing I hate."""
447,Emotion,ChangePoemsChangePoembyGilGregorio,"It is a perilous venture to an unknown
where the living world is limitless
like weeds from a faraway land
dreaming...and hoping...
It is a desert where the woes tremble
like a torch's sparkle at night
and the origin is not known yet
chanting...and lifting...
But, it has wings that can endure
even swallow those that are bigger;
It has eyes that can examine
even those who do not deserve it.
Most of all, it begins everything new!"
448,Emotion,ChangePoemsAChangeOfHeartPoembyMichaelPJohnson,"I'm full of joy and richly blessed
Of Christ I'm never shy
I'll journey through this world as guest
Until the day I die
Though old, grey near worldly dead
The grave my flesh may see
But souls who've eaten Heaven's Bread
Will rise complete and free
Free of sin of eternal wrath
Free through innocent blood
Free to travel Christ's trodden path
And live the way I should
It's not too late to change your ways
Seek Jesus' help on high
Fix on Him your fervent gaze
Or least of all to try
For God can see a troubled soul
The heart of those still blind
Seeking someone to make them whole
Searching for peace of mind
God sees the filth that keeps us bound
Lost, through satanic lies
He sees who seek the higher ground
In righteousness to rise
He sees who kill, rape, cheat, connive
Deceivers greedy for gain
Liars, thieves believing to thrive
Hoping with Christ to reign
Only who turn to live anew
Washed clean in Heaven's Flame
As virgin bride God's chosen few
Receive The Bride-Groom's name......"

To kingdom's builded on life's overthrow;
Onward with other poets I shall go,
Unpraised of thee. though praised of all my peers,
Until the vine that thou hast quckened, bears
Its fruit in others' hands; until I grow
So different from myself I shall not know
This poor young desperate heart, nor these wild tears.
But though I change, thou shalt not change with me,
Thy shrine shall stand unaltered and unmoved,
And if we meet again I shall but see
The features of a stranger, thou wilt be
Wholly what once thou wert to me, Beloved
And not what time and men have made of thee"

He grew fat, and he grew fatter,
Though he hardly had a thing to eat for dinner;
While a man in Booboorowie
Often sat and wondered how he
Could prevent himself from growing any thinner.
So the man from Oodnadatta
He came down to Booboorowie,
Where he rapidly grew flatter;
And the folk will tell you how he
Urged the man from Booboorowie
To go up to Oodnadatta -
Where he lived awhile, and now he
Is considerably fatter."

A long tough battle won."

That caresses my hair
And the warmth of the autumn sun

I recall days of endless wonder
Never at a loss for adventure
Experience filled my days
With joy and sorrow -
I never thought it would end;
Now I treasure every moment
Holding them close to my heart
Making deep impressions
To last me through the winter
For spring may never come;
And you will be the one thought
That will carry me through the night
Stay close, my love,
Whisper soft and sweet
The words I'll always remember."
453,Emotion,ChangePoemsChangeOfSeasonsPoembyJosephTRenaldi,"The Summer season gradually fades away,
Nature's way of bidding a humble farewell to all.
A change is seen as the leaves fade in unison
As the beautiful Autumn season comes to call.
September - the sounds in the garden are quiet now,
The song birds are no longer to be found.
Flying high up in the cloudy sky,
Many feathered friends are southward bound.
October - the trees are covered with tantalizing colors
Of red and gold and yellow and even brown,
And crimson, too, in a multitude of fashion
The leaves come wafting down.
November - fringed with frost and nippy cold,
The fading days of Autumn are everywhere.
A quiet state of melancholy days
With signs of a changing season in the air.
December - All of a sudden the winds of winter blow,
The falling snow begins to pile high.
We are delighted for the bounty Autumn has provided,
Uttering words of thank you - with an appreciative sigh."
454,Emotion,ChangePoemsChangePoembyChristalCarpenter,"Thoughts broke down from my dreams demise
As I shut my dreaming eyes
Stars flickered out
My wish lost truth
As I cried in a phone booth
The string untied
Memories faded away
I cried all night and I cried all day
Missing you
And you haven't even left me
Missing who
You used to be
I'm missing you
And I wish
That you'd leave me,
Just wish
That you'd leave me alone
Knowledge broke through
Hope lost touch
I cried too much
Just thinking of you
The pain came down
My smile turned to frown
And I wish I could walk away
I just with that I could walk away
Missing you
And you haven't even left me
Missing who
You used to be
I'm missing you
And I wish
That you'd leave me,
Just wish
That you'd leave me alone"

456,Emotion,ChangePoemsIfICouldChangeThingsPoembyShelleyLBaxter,"I am at a loss, for the words to say,
for the pain you feel today.
I know this loss is harder then,
most difficult times along lifes way.
For if I could change things
please know I surely would...
for this great Man your grieving for,
the woman you called Dad; grandpa,
will remain in your hearts for good.
He is not really gone...
keep him alive in your memory,
til you meet again, many years from now,
in another land, a better place, In heaven.

457,Emotion,ChangePoemsICannotChangeAsOthersDoPoembyLordJohnWilmot,"I cannot change, as others do,
Though you unjustly scorn;
Since that poor swain that sighs for you,
For you alone was born.
No, Phyllis, no, your heart to move
A surer way I'll try:
And to revenge my slighted love,
Will still love on, will still love on, and die.
When, killed with grief, Amintas lies
And you to mind shall call,
The sighs that now unpitied rise,
The tears that vainly fall,
That welcome hour that ends this smart
Will then begin your pain;
For such a fauthful tender heart
Can never break, can never break in vain."
458,Emotion,ChangePoemsYouReJustTheLostLooseChangeOfMyLifePoembyDónallDempsey,"Your love
was worth millions

£6 and nine pence worth of you."
459,Emotion,ChangePoemsILoveYouAsYouAreNowChangePoembyFlyingLemming,"I love the way you talk to anyone, do you have to talk to her
I love the way you love animals, you know I’m allergic to fur
I love the way you are different, you’re not going out in that hat
I love the way you dance, do you have to embarrass me like that
I love the way you are well read, you gonna waste money on that book
I love the way you think I’m beautiful, why’d you give me that leering look
I love the way you’ll help anyone, bet it’s just to fuel your ego
I love the way you’re spontaneous, this isn’t where I wanted to go
I love the way I fill you with desire, I told you I’m not in the mood
I love the way you’re relaxed about your body, do you really need all that food
I love the way you are still fun, do you really need that toy
I love the way you still act young, sometimes you’re like a little boy
I love the way you collect me from work, isn’t it time you got a new car
I love the way I feel natural around you, stop looking while I’m only in my bra
I love the way you always have a smile, why’d you have to wear that silly grin
I love that you just let yourself go, do you really have to try to sing
And if you keep on with that annoying laugh I don’t think I’ll last another day
I’m so glad we met ‘cos I think that you’re perfect … why you walking away?"

When I’m about to lose my mind

When I talk
All you do is mock"
462,Emotion,ChangePoemsABetterChangeOrBitterChangePoembyRameshTA,"A change is what everybody dreams and wants to see
The change we see – is it better or bad? It’s the question!
Every morning the colourful Sun rise is beautiful to see!
The singing birds inspire us to be free and happy in life!
The jolly good squirrels kindle us too to play as they do!
We can see crows and sparrows all around our houses!
We see beautiful clouds of colour changes at the Sunset,
Night sky full of countless Stars and Moon shining bright!
All these things are Nature at its best nobody can neglect!
Now those things we cannot see and enjoy anymore so!
Morning and evening twilights are beautifully all right;
Stars and Moon in the night times are as usual perfect.
But Nature on the Earth has changed without any doubt!
Farming lands have turned into Satellite towns around town;
Crows, sparrows have disappeared with the destruction of trees!
Farmers have come to towns to work as masons and mill workers;
Population, traffic, pollution have increased with food grain price!
Money is not enough to buy all people need as rain in summer!
Men drink and talk themselves and lie on the pavements;
At night it is common they sleep where dogs and pigs frequent;
All have become one according to socialism politics advocates!
Swine flu, bird flu and SARS are spreading the entire world now!
And Stars and Moon wink eyes at this big farce of society so!"
463,Emotion,ChangePoemsAsSeasonsChangeAsWePoembyDeborahMVanderwood,"To everything there is a season,
A time of gladness, grief and cheer,
Smiles of laughter, sadness of tears,
For every sunset there's a sunrise,
There is no rainbow without the rain,
No summer time without the spring,
Golden days and frosty nights,
Icy winds thoughout the days,
With winters newly fallen snows,
Whose years are like the seasons,
Let the future hold no doubt,
There'll come a change of scene,
With rain bound skies of hope and love,
I have seen your different faces,
Life is like the changing seasons,
Upward always climb,
As the seasons change as we."
464,Emotion,ChangePoemsModernLoveXButWhereBeganTheChangePoembyGeorgeMeredith,"But where began the change; and what's my crime?
The wretch condemned, who has not been arraigned,
Chafes at his sentence. Shall I, unsustained,
Drag on Love's nerveless body thro' all time?
I must have slept, since now I wake. Prepare,
You lovers, to know Love a thing of moods:
Not like hard life, of laws. In Love's deep woods,
I dreamt of loyal Life:--the offence is there!
Love's jealous woods about the sun are curled;
At least, the sun far brighter there did beam.
My crime is, that the puppet of a dream,
I plotted to be worthy of the world.
Oh, had I with my darling helped to mince
The facts of life, you still had seen me go
With hindward feather and with forward toe,
Her much-adored delightful Fairy Prince!"
465,Emotion,ChangePoemsWindOfChangePoembyLillianJamison,"The wind of change
Blows through our days
Sometimes can leave
Our minds with haze
When thinks do not
Go as expected
It is easy to feel
Quite dejected
If we live
With love inside
And never faith
We compromise
We can bring
Our dreams to reality
Transform that haze
Into clarity
Wind of change
Can be uplifting
Promising
And also gifting
A chance for
Love and new beginnings
When you believe
You end up winning"
466,Emotion,ChangePoemsChanceAndChangePoembyEstherLeclerc,"For one ruined in love, the old status quo
Offers comfort of a kind tho' cold.
Suffering neglect, your heart is a wreck,
Yet one's vow demands payment of debt.
Honorbound to see old promises through,
Despite the cost and the loss, you do.
For years it's been wrong, and forever's so long,
Wanting to be held, to be known, to belong.
Chances to let go, to be free and to know
How good it feels as love flowers and grows
Have come and gone just as dusk chases dawn,
Like pretty dreams light a world dark and wan.
Change is a Chance taken - - not another need
Forsaken to spare one whose tight heart will bleed.
Don't fear that long leap o'er the abyss of trust,
Just close your eyes... life without love is but dust."
467,Emotion,ChangePoemsWelcomeChangePoembyPatRichards,"Near to the ocean

Close to my heart
""Welcome"" change... but then
Everything resumes its course"

When I have a change of address
And I have to tell everybody
That I have just moved
And you have to leave
The friends that you have
But, you do find new ones
At your new address"
469,Emotion,ChangePoemsChangeTheInevitablePoembyJakeHarris,"Change is to one man the death of a friend,
To another the birth of a child.
Change is the shifting of soft winds of spring,
to a hurricane deadly and wild.
Change is the moving of the hourglass sands,
It's the coming of dawn after dark.
Change is taking one step at a time,
The emotion in each persons heart.
But change in the end, will not change at all
The one constant in everyone's lives
Change is the light at the end of the tunnel
The healer who opens our eyes."
470,Emotion,ChangePoemsHotTracksCanTChangeTheFactsThatPeopleArenTTheCauseOfGlobalWarmingPoembyTedSheridan,"Today the summer sun beats down on me like it did when I was back in Nam
Making me crazy with a touch of the malaria......making me
mad enough to overreact to the slightest breeze
exhaled from the painted lips of a one legged diseased ridden concubine
Like the one that cleaned the hooch when I was back in Nam.....
She had a way of setting me off....flapping those lips....kind of like Madonna does.....
With all her Al Gore Global warming crap....
If she wanted to truly save the planet....she'd close her mouth and legs....."
471,Emotion,ChangePoemslandscapesCollectionAChangeOfSeasonPoembyJaniceWindle,"Just as I believe that autumn's gone,
left bare branches dressed in shades of grey,
melted the glowing leaves to muddy slime,
stealing sunlight, shortening my day –
just  as I prepare to go to ground,
to tell myself to close my eyes,
accept the long dark cell
where I must make my home till spring –
I turn a corner on the narrow track and reach
the downward slope.
And here time’s slowed  it seems.
Still, in this one place,
slim beech trunks, green velvet covered,
scattered with gold and bronze, stand warm
against dark thickets in the forest.
And though the sky outside is grey
this tunnel, where the trees protect their own,
holds autumn’s final breath
before December's sterile chill comes down."

the revolution reaches autumn.
the wings of my dreams join the birds,
preparing to fly south.
the fireflies of my passion,
lay down the final gauntlet.
i let go of my thoughts,
and listen, just listen!
we walk a thousand miles,
to become seed and dirt.
the world that was distant,
now the sweat on my brow.
for i am the world...

473,Emotion,ChangePoemsEverythingThatWillNotChangePoembyAmberleeCarter,"I want to remember the world this way:
The light, steadfast on the windowsill,
a breathless sky and the autumn as beautiful
as it is bitter.
The way it was just yesterday
when you held me against your chest, against
a backdropp of sunset: so many colors
evolving into darkness- rearranging themselves
into the first evening shadows.
I want to sleep with the memory of you
still fresh inside of my head, and the scent
of your kisses still clinging to my lips.
Your eyes: cathartic pools I wish I could dive into,
to drown myself in their prismatic vision.
How does it feel to see the world, to see life
through a third eye?
I wish I could see beyond my sorrow and live
beyond my darkness- then I’d see myself
not entirely unraveled, but tearing at the seams
to become something more, something other than
the girl with a big smile to sacrifice to the world,
who will always be just a little bit sad."
474,Emotion,ChangePoemsChangePoembyAbbySowers,"Change is hard
i try to change
Sorry im such a disapointment
I show great deplore
Couldn't live up to your excpectations
I try to change for the nation
Even tried consultation
there is no short cut
Gotta take the long road
So your probably fed-up
my heart has been cut up
there isn't much more i can do
tried everything for you
thats cause change is hard
feels like i've been hung out to dry
In front of a hundred eyes
I do try
but thats not enough
not enough for change"
475,Emotion,ChangePoemsChangeAndDeathPoembyCharlesHarpur,"We build but for change and for death,
To whom a like homage pay glory and shame;
For something must pass to give being to both.
All things are rounded by change, and are perishing—
Even the God-builded frame of the world.
The glories of life, as they shine,
But illumine a path to the gloom of the grave,
And the winter of shame is soon over and gone!
Of all we inherit, behold the inheritors!
Throned on the endless successions of Time."
476,Emotion,ChangePoemsConstancyInChangePoembyJohannWolfgangvonGoethe,"COULD this early bliss but rest
Constant for one single hour!
But e'en now the humid West
Scatters many a vernal shower.
Should the verdure give me joy?
'Tis to it I owe the shade;
Soon will storms its bloom destroy,
Soon will Autumn bid it fade.
Eagerly thy portion seize,
If thou wouldst possess the fruit!
Fast begin to ripen these,
And the rest already shoot.
With each heavy storm of rain
Change comes o'er thy valley fair;
Once, alas! but not again
Can the same stream hold thee e'er.
And thyself, what erst at least
Firm as rocks appear'd to rise,
Walls and palaces thou seest
But with ever-changing eyes.
Fled for ever now the lip
That with kisses used to glow,
And the foot, that used to skip
O'er the mountain, like the roe.
And the hand, so true and warm,
Ever raised in charity,
And the cunning-fashion'd form,--
All are now changed utterly.
And what used to bear thy name,
When upon yon spot it stood,
Like a rolling billow came,
Hast'ning on to join the flood.
Be then the beginning found
With the end in unison,
Swifter than the forms around
Are themselves now fleeting on!
Thank the merit in thy breast,
Thank the mould within thy heart,
That the Muses' favour blest
Ne'er will perish, ne'er depart."
477,Emotion,ChangePoemsPeopleChangePoembyZiaJayceeMayTrent,"Why do people change?
What is the problem with being yourself?
Are you scared of ruining your image?
Is that more important?
Why do people change?
Can’t they just be themselves?
Why do they go away?
Do they think they’re cool because they wear the same jeans?
Why do people change?
Can’t the world just stay the same?
Who cares if you hair isn’t straight?
Who cares if your mouth isn't always open?
Why do people change?
Why do people hide under a mask?
Are they afraid they won't be accepted anymore?
Who do people shun others who are unlike?
Why do people change?
Is the change for the good of the world?
Or is it for the need to feel wanted?
Why do people feel they aren't good enough?
Are you?
Will you change?"

479,Emotion,ChangePoemsWelcomeChangePoembyGinaWhitacre,"Change is inevitable,
But yet we fight it, just the same.
Change is essential to our evolution.
Change is going to happen,
In fact, it happens every day,
Maybe it is too small to see, or perhaps we would rather not see it.
We fight change, because we fight the unknown,
We fight the unknown, because we are scared,
Scared of change, scared of the unknown.
If we were to allow change to happen freely,
We might find solutions to the problems that exist around us,
But instead, we are hung - up on controlling everything around us.
Maybe this is the problem with the world today.
Everyone assumes control of everything and does not allow nature to run her course.
Maybe this is why, we have devastating fall out from Nature,
Natural catastrophic disasters, such as fire and flooding.
We fight change, therefore we are fighting nature and her natural being and her existence
in the world that she has created by God's hand and has graciously allowed us to be a
part of.
We should welcome change and allow nature to control our destiny.
Change is uncontrollable,
Change is inevitable,
Change is the unknown.
Nature takes pride in being one of life's illusive wonders, the unknown."
480,Emotion,ChangePoemsAChangeOfSeasonsPoembyJoLynnEhnesAllen,"Autumnal winds caress my face
as summer's heated breeze expires.
The years have quickened in their pace,
foregoing my misplaced desires.
As winter lurks not far ahead
my memory drifts to warmer days,
where on a greener grass I tread
absorbing love's adoring rays.
Beneath the August moon we'd dance,
embracing 'til the blaze of dawn,
but violent gusts would steal my chance
and whisk away the dreams I'd drawn.
Through fallen leaves of yesteryears
I sift for blades of thriving hope,
to help me cool these caustic tears
and find the strength and will to cope.
For in the autumn of my life
is when I'll gain a peace within,
discarding weights of pain and strife
and letting reigns of joy begin.
Then when the days of fall conclude
and winter takes its turn on stage,
I know my soul will be renewed
as life records my final page."
481,Emotion,ChangePoemsChangePoembySMRiggin,"you have changed
and it's not for the better

but please dont change. not for her.
Standing from the outside I can see it.
you're different, not the same,
I'm not too sure about this new person

482,Emotion,ChangePoemsTimeAndChangePoembyPadmoreEnyonamAgbemabiese,"time and fate may separate friends and lovers
but friendship or love that's true will live forever
true love conquers all odds with patience
and hope keeps them alive forever
Grandma used to tell us all
things of this world will change with time
since all things have their turn to change
the sick has a time to heal
while the poor will come to wealth with time
in this world events change with the years
and the seasons will surely come and go
so everything has its time and day
so wait on time to begin a new day
to change the course of your life
for if you look around you
nothing in the universe is constant,
only true love is forever faithful"
483,Emotion,ChangePoemsYouCannotChangeThePastPoembyFrancisDuggan,"You cannot change the past 'tis gone forever
And worrying only turns your hair to gray
And remember 'tis the future's all that matter
For we cannot change what happened yesterday.
Don't harbour grudges for grudges only harm you
For a grudge like a cancer only grow
ill feeling on you can become a burden
And you'll feel happier when you leave your grudges go.
Karma will take care of all wrongdoers
And all of those who harm others in any way
Will one day for their mistakes feel regretful
When to karma they will have a price to pay.
You cannot change the past what's done is over
Before we walked we had to learn to crawl
And from the book of life we're always learning
And the future's all that matter after all.
The past is gone and the past is past changing
And let bygones be bygones so it has been said
And put more of your thought energy into your future
For your happier days for you might be ahead."

I feel like I’m standing over a steaming pot.
Beads of sweat pouring down my face,
Inopportune times embarrassing place.
I’m fed up with this inward inferno.
Burning, burning from the inside out.
Wake  during the night soaking wet.
listless, tired, out of bed I get
How long will it last,10 years you say,
Oh no Lord, take this misery away.
Good news, good news, help on the way,
Books and products line the shelves today.
I sit and ponder about the women of yesteryear.
Why the mental institutions kept them there.
Menopause, a change of life,
educate yourself, eliminate the strife."
485,Emotion,ChangePoemsElegyIiiChangePoembyJohnDonne,"Although thy hand and faith, and good works too,
Have seal'd thy love which nothing should undo,
Yea though thou fall back, that apostasy
Confirm thy love; yet much, much I fear thee.
Women are like the Arts, forc'd unto none,
Open to'all searchers, unpriz'd, if unknown.
If I have caught a bird, and let him fly,
Another fouler using these means, as I,
May catch the same bird; and, as these things be,
Women are made for men, not him, nor me.
Foxes and goats; all beasts change when they please,
Shall women, more hot, wily, wild then these,
Be bound to one man, and did Nature then
Idly make them apter to endure than men?
They are our clogges, not their owne; if a man be
Chain'd to a galley, yet the galley is free;
Who hath a plow-land, casts all his seed corn there,
And yet allows his ground more corn should bear;
Though Danuby into the sea must flow,
The sea receives the Rhene, Volga, and Po.
By nature, which gave it, this liberty
Thou lov'st, but Oh! canst thou love it and me?
Likeness glues love: Then if so thou do,
To make us like and love, must I change too?
More than thy hate, I hate it, rather let me
Allow her change, then change as oft as she,
And so not teach, but force my opinion
To love not any one, nor every one.
To live in one land is captivity,
To run all countries, a wild roguery;
Waters stink soon, if in one place they bide,
And in the vast sea are worse putrified:
But when they kiss one bank, and leaving this
Never look back, but the next bank do kiss,
Then are they purest; Change is the nursery
Of music, joy, life, and eternity."
486,Emotion,ChangePoemsChangeRightPoembyGeoffWarden,"The Autumn morn' awakes
leaves vibrantly cloth himself
taking chance upon winds
searching for new
breath
In the journey unto
the winds of chance
each touch
then flow apart
then touch again
Yet in each touch
something new
something old
something peculiar
never the same
Each time the winds of chance
blows a leaf
from it's branch

then takes it's prance
life has a kiss...."
487,Emotion,ChangePoemsTheChangePoembyAnneKingsmillFinch,"POOR River, now thou'rt almost dry,
What Nymph, or Swain, will near thee lie?
Since brought, alas! to sad Decay,
What Flocks, or Herds, will near thee stay?
The Swans, that sought thee in thy Pride,
Now on new Streams forgetful ride:
And Fish, that in thy Bosom lay,
Chuse in more prosp'rous Floods to play.
All leave thee, now thy Ebb appears,
To waste thy sad Remains in Tears;
Nor will thy mournful Murmurs heed.
Fly, wretched Stream, with all thy speed,
Amongst those solid Rocks thy Griefs bestow;
For Friends, like those alas! thou ne'er did'st know.
And thou, poor Sun! that sat'st on high;
But late, the Splendour of the Sky;
What Flow'r, tho' by thy Influence born,
Now Clouds prevail, will tow'rds thee turn?
Now Darkness sits upon thy Brow,
What Persian Votary will bow?
What River will her Smiles reflect,
Now that no Beams thou can'st direct?
By watry Vapours overcast,
Who thinks upon thy Glories past?
If present Light, nor Heat we get,
Unheeded thou may'st rise, and set.
Not all the past can one Adorer keep,
Fall, wretched Sun, to the more faithful Deep.
Nor do thou, lofty Structure! boast,
Since undermin'd by Time and Frost:
Since thou canst no Reception give,
In untrod Meadows thou may'st live.
None from his ready Road will turn,
With thee thy wretched Change to mourn.
Not the soft Nights, or chearful Days
Thou hast bestow'd, can give thee Praise.
No lusty Tree that near thee grows,
(Tho' it beneath thy Shelter rose)
Will to thy Age a Staff become.
Fall, wretched Building! to thy Tomb.
Thou, and thy painted Roofs, in Ruin mixt,
Fall to the Earth, for That alone is fixt.
The same, poor Man, the same must be
Thy Fate, now Fortune frowns on thee.
Her Favour ev'ry one pursues,
And losing Her, thou all must lose.
No Love, sown in thy prosp'rous Days,
Can Fruit in this cold Season raise:
No Benefit, by thee conferr'd,
Can in this time of Storms be heard.
All from thy troubl'd Waters run;
Thy stooping Fabrick all Men shun.
All do thy clouded Looks decline,
As if thou ne'er did'st on them shine.
O wretched Man! to other World's repair;
For Faith and Gratitude are only there."
488,Emotion,ChangePoemsTheHappyChangePoembyWilliamCowper,"How bless'd Thy creature is, O God,
When with a single eye,
He views the lustre of Thy Word,
The dayspring from on high!
Through all the storms that veil the skies
And frown on earthly things,
The Sun of Righteousness he eyes,
With healing on His wings.
Struck by that light, the human heart,
A barren soil no more,
Sends the sweet smell of grace abroad,
Where serpents lurk'd before.
The soul, a dreary province once
Of Satan's dark domain,
Feels a new empire form'd within,
And owns a heavenly reign.
The glorious orb whose golden beams
The fruitful year control,
Since first obedient to Thy WOrd,
He started from the goal,
Has cheer'd the nations with the joys
His orient rays impart;
But, Jesus, 'tis Thy light alone
Can shine upon the heart."
489,Emotion,ChangePoemsToChangeYourNamePoembySharonLNorris,"A very wise person once wrote that it’s
The choices we make that define the person we are.
The decision you’ve made to change your name
Is one of the most important choices you’ll ever make —
Something no one else can do for you.
Just like the butterfly that emerges from the chrysalis,
Changing your name heralds a new stage in your life.
Like the butterfly, may you go out into this world
With pride, with courage, and with the certain knowledge that
Your new name has added meaning and purpose to your life."

You will be able to ride on the bus
Without geting wet"

A joyous melody
Which sang a tune of gratitude

Sweet as bells on Sunday
Announcing heavens berth
Sailing past on golden rays
To sing of Peace on Earth

492,Emotion,ChangePoemsChangeUponChangePoembyElizabethBarrettBrowning,"Five months ago the stream did flow,
The lilies bloomed within the sedge,
And we were lingering to and fro,
Where none will track thee in this snow,
Along the stream, beside the hedge.
Ah, Sweet, be free to love and go!
For if I do not hear thy foot,
The frozen river is as mute,
The flowers have dried down to the root:
And why, since these be changed since May,
Shouldst thou change less than they.
And slow, slow as the winter snow
The tears have drifted to mine eyes;
And my poor cheeks, five months ago
Set blushing at thy praises so,
Put paleness on for a disguise.
Ah, Sweet, be free to praise and go!
For if my face is turned too pale,
It was thine oath that first did fail, --
It was thy love proved false and frail, --
And why, since these be changed enow,
Should I change less than thou."
493,Emotion,ChangePoemsWindsOfChangeWillBlowSomeDayPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"Nothing will stay forev’r the same:
Sky, earth, land, sea, vale, mountain, air;
The honest souls, why should all blame?
Let things happen, why should we care?
The sky will change and come will rain;
The soil with seed will sprout again;
A plant will grow quite speedily;
A mighty tree will stand truly!
With roots so deep, good fruits to reap;
And branches stout and strong will peep; .
And it will live a hundred years,
And lauded be, much more than peers.
And give all shade, yet not be paid;
While birds build nest and gladly rest.
The world will say on its D-Day:
Oh, what a tree and go away!
Yeah, things are done by word of God
In heaven, earth by same one Lord;
The world today though unfair be,
Cannot stay so for long surely.
For, winds of change will blow some day,
And truth will have its final say;
And acknowledge will people all:
’Tis best to heed to Maker’s call.

495,Emotion,RespectPoemsRespectPoembyDavidHarris,"If we can not respect another
How can we expect them to respect us
If we can not respect someone’s beliefs
How can we expect them to respect ours
If we can not respect another’s race
How can we expect that race to respect us
If we can not respect others
How can we expect respect in return
Everyone expects respect
No matter who they are
The only way to gain it
Is to start treating everyone
As a friend, a brother, a sister
As part of our extended family
No matter what colour or creed they are
Only then you will start to get
The respect you so dearly crave"

498,Emotion,RespectPoemsWeDoNotRespectHerAtAllPoembyFrancisDuggan,"Those who spend decades learning about Nature of Nature's ways will tell you they have much to know
Her deepest secrets we will never learn of and our wonder of her only seem to grow
One could live for a thousand years and yet not know all about her as her most precious secrets with us she will never share
And yet in part due to us she does seem much the poorer as many of her life forms either extinct or rare
Many of her waterways by us have been polluted our factories puff up black smoke to the sky
Why do we try to harm the one who feeds us that is the question many have asked why
Without us Nature would do nicely though for to live on her we do depend
She supplies all of our needs for our existence though to her we are not a good friend
In technology humans have come far and many human achievements are great
But we've not been respectful to Nature and that's something we cannot celebrate
But Nature she will live forever and like her Seasons we come to life and die
Immortality for us Homo Sapiens has surely been based on a lie
We depend on her for our very existence and our achievements to her seem so small
And though we are one of her life forms we do not respect her at all."

They have no qualms about who they insult

people anymore, what does it matter

They shun and ignore the older generation
as though they were not there.

They won’t be so belligerent and bold,
When they too  eventually grow old.
Maybe they too will look back  with sadness

500,Emotion,RespectPoemsBeCautiousWhenTreatingPeopleWithRespectPoembyLawrenceSPertillar,"Be cautious when treating people with respect,
Especially those that are not accustomed to it.
They begin to expect,
Anything they do to be acceptable.
Being direct and factual...
When and if pointing out a shown irresponsibility,
Upsets their track record of being negligent.
And your outspoken candor,
Can and will offend them to no end.
You will be the first one they accuse,
Of abusing their insecurities...
Others ignore,
But choose to talk about this and them...
Behind their backs.
And whether this is known or not...
Those actions of others are preferred,
To keep their egos intact!
And you may be the first to express...
You will have none of that!
Never stop respecting,
But choose not to be a welcome mat!
And everyone knows what they are used for!"

That is something some find hard to understand
You earn respect if respect you do show
From people in your life you've come to know
Of Respect or lack of we do read of and hear
Though 'tis a thing that cannot be born of fear
Of somebody who has power over you
In your feigned respect your feelings are not true.
Many may respect and admire the high achievers of the town
And applaud them on their journey to renown
But with the many some do disagree
Through different eyes we see things differently.
Respect is something you can only show
For one that you feel privileged for to know
And of any shackles true respect is free
That's how it is and that's how 'twill always be."

At least you near to the people
For what ever cause and trouble

Try to malign motive behind and test
They want simple excuse to air dissent
They have actually lost civility and curtsey is absent
I am sure of great respect
When they will know about my act

505,Emotion,RespectPoems20110401HonourAndRespectRevPoembyMargaretAlice,"Nicolas Shrady; sceptic on a pilgrimage,
following holy trails to religious shrines,
seeking the spiritual within the physical –
realising he was ‘an outsider, a passive
observer, and always would be’
Saw artificial attempts to impress, had to
be content with only meditation, could not
simulate false piety, couldn’t find what he
doesn’t already believe
Observation proved fickle – symbolical
content depends on already present belief,
tried ceremonies, followed customs, found
faith had no roots in anything substantial
Supernatural events happen to believers
only, which the five senses abjure, faithless
see nothing; he enjoyed a fabulous spiritual
journey, made  friends,
Learned to appreciate wonder and beauty of
innocence, trust in the human heart, but  the
ability of the believer to make things true
which a sceptic can never see taught him

506,Emotion,RespectPoemsRespectToItPoembyFrancisDuggan,"Respect to it has more than a one sided way
Do not expect the respect of others if respect to them you don't pay
You treat other people as you'd like them to treat you
And in turn they will give you the respect you are due
You may be the wealthiest and most powerful person in your town
And you feel that you have the right for to put others down
And others respect you or so to you it does appear
But between feigned and true respect the difference is quite clear
Despotic leaders believe the masses them do revere
But this sort of feigned adulation is adulation through fear
To protest in such circumstance they'd be risking their own lives
And the lives of their children as well as their wives
If you do not respect then respect do not expect to receive
Just a known fact of life that one ought to believe."

And the mischievous sneak hangs about…

With well-known and noble means…

Such order takes roots in the heavens…

With the weather just gorgeous

Tries to discipline her son
He just would not listen
He just wanted to have fun
As the mother told him to sit down
He raised his foot at her

I was left in a stare
Where is the respect
Has this boy lost his mind
The situation is looking bleak
As the boy's behavior is so unkind"

Even with heroic record nothing is sung
People forget their sacrifice
Even state fails to honor the promise
Dependent families run door to door
They helplessly watch and think about neighbor
They look at far distant sky
With only one questioning mind, why?
What drives people to sacrifice?
For motherland with simple advice
“Die for honorable cause and attain heaven”
Does this sentence make sense even?
The state suffers attitude
It looses the magnitude
The cause is lost in wilderness
People resent sacrifice and painfully face
All talks of honor becomes joke
The valor is lost behind thick smoke

As their fair name is deliberately robbed
Give some respect to families
They want no mercy
Give them due share
Do not give them frightening stare"

Then who will save you,
From the fire of the world?

And your progress ceases
In the mid way,
And you are struggling with yourself,
Oh, you remain alone,
Not even the soul is left,
And the shoulder you don’t have to cry on,
But the frustration hugs you
Wherever you go in life
How poor you have become,
In blessings,
And a bad lot hovering
Around you all the times,
Then how will you escape?
If nothing is left with you,
Don’t forget the last option
Remains with you,
You better go to your mother
And ask her for sorry
Then the heaven is with you
To protect from devil’s shadow"

542,Emotion,RespectPoemsLoveWithRespectPoembyRmShanmugamChettiar,"Love gives comfort; respect gives courage.
Love sedates one and respect inspires.
Love lulls you and respect awakes you.
You can’t demand love but command respect.
Love with respect or respect with love
Is what people, be high or low, expect
From those outside their family circle.
There only exist human relations."

544,Emotion,RespectPoemsRespectForYouPoembyMichaelPMcParland,"I have respect for you
in so many different ways.
Your fire and your passion,
your kindness and your love,
your strength to fight through all the pain.
I openly admire you for your
determined honest ways.
I respect you for having
given me so much of your
patience and precious time.
The second chances when I have
screwed up like a foolish child.
I respect that you've taken all the time
to truly get to know me.
Broken through and down so many walls
that so many others never had the
courage to even try and climb.
I love and respect you for understanding
why the walls were there foe such a long time.
I respect and admire your rock hard
perseverance in the face of hate and doubt.
I truly can't tell you all the ways
I respect and love you for there's too
much there to count.
Just know that I love you dear,
respect you and hold you as a hero
that I so admire and who's loving
dedication and confidence I look to and aspire."

547,Emotion,RespectPoemsSomePeopleHaveNoRespectForOurBeliefPoembyLionelFogarty,"Jesus I learned you lived and lived
Jesus we heard you died and die
Jesus I see them painting of you so white
Jesus I hear them sing, you lackey of God they sang.
Jesus I know people today use you wrong
they came with guns in hand
shot our minds with
untrue words
Black – the meaning of sin
Black – the heathen savages
Black – the false, the lies
Black – the inhuman without a home and culture
These pink skinned people say “You light of God”
and make us wash black sins to be close to white.
O, Jesus, if so you were true
You were black
fighting against a white regime.
O, Jesus, they tear away our hearts
that yell for Nature
They will do things of tension, fear, control,
death, brutality and murder to our Aboriginal people’s
beliefs.
Why they must do this O, Jesus, this once Jesus
All in the name of you

Everyone for Jesus, the Church shall have them all”"

Patience and kindness to listen to what others have to say.

Teach us to respect good criticism to us as with others we talk.

550,Emotion,RespectPoemsRespectRespectMePoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"Respect, respect me, I say
In every single way
Respect me day by day
Don’t put me down
When we are out and about with people around
Playing me like a fool
Portraying me as one who never went to school
Respect me sweet heart
Till life sets us apart
Respect my needs
Listen and take heed
Respect to me is what means love
And not those commonly spoken words,
‘I love you’
To respect me is to publicly and privately honour me
To respect me is to listen attentively while I speak
To respect me is to bread and butter my desire to be free
To respect me is to stand by me when I am weak
Look up! Look up to me!
I may not be perfect
Nor a genius of an intellect
Respect, respect me & our love will stand erect!

Away
And pay
Scant respect
To beggars
Who stay not near?
But far from civilized world
To have their own fold
They know
And blow
With wind
And not mind
Someday some change
May come in with time edge
Who knows what may be swept away?
The fortune, wealth or greedy way
No world for beggars
No words for poor
But look backward
And then think forward
Patience they have
And silently behave too
With insult
And deep restraint"

556,Emotion,RespectPoemsMarkOfRespectPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"Women need it as mark of respect
We all have to think seriously and introspect
When God has made it then why do we stand as suspect?
Has everything got relevance with cast, creed, color or sect?
Yes, color do attract us for certain reasons
It is natural and varies from person to person
But is it the only criteria to hate an individual?
Still we have we to fight against role called dubious or dual?
I salute to those who stand against such move?
They may be threatened with their live or removed
Yet the fight may not be over till it ends
We as an human beings must change our trend
We are in land of peace and liberty
We are equally blessed with freedom from almighty
Why do we create hatred only on the basis of color?
This is not simple matter but serious and major
Some of the people may not speak openly against
But secretly they will bless and insist
That struggle rages on indefinitely
The people are brandished and disappear quietly
It is suppression and blot on humanity
It is not even today discouraged for continuity
Enough blood has been shed and still it remains
Let us do everything which is possible in our domain"

Your ills become known
They are washed away
The moment you pray
My heart beats for those
Who repose
Trust and confidence

But poet and good at oratory
I write in simple way
No show off or employ any other way
I find light all around
As you were found
From the crowd
To claim loud
It was rare occasion
When I proposed for relation
You were straight forward
Took me near with true words
You are exceptional
Approach too very rationale
No show off or over imposition
You are Pak* friend suited for union
I am not in this world
When chatting with cold
Soul who is whispering slowly
Leaving in between abruptly
Yes I too respect
And act
With honor
That shall be due to lover
What shall ask her?
To shed fear
And come near
I think simple address of ""dear"""

562,Emotion,RespectPoemsLoveJesusFaithRespectPoembyTomZart,"Many of this world face heartbreak and failure
Broken homes, joblessness, loneliness, loss and war.
Even God’s disciples had to battle doubt and depression
As Jesus and Satan shadowed every window and door.
Throughout life we experience regret, fear and longings
While seeking love, fame, sex, revenue, and romance.
Most learn the hard way how to behave and relate
To become all that we are by servitude and chance.
God blesses those who triumph through faithfulness and love
By the way they provide, treasure and protect.
All of us suffer issues, weaknesses and shortcomings
As we celebrate life, love, Jesus, faith and respect.

You don't have to 'show some love'
You don't have to smack my back,

You don't have to pass me by.
You don't have to greet me w/ a cheery lie.

for life itself in all

for every casual brush

for the individuality and

we find sameness!
not to change
a rainbow to

but to take each

565,Emotion,RespectPoemsRespectTimePoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"Respect! Respect!
Time I respect you
Time is of great essence
Respect time
Before it imposes on you a sentence
As if you have committed a crime
Time is precious like a diamond
Time must come first never second
Respect time
For time itself is the sublime
Time never waits
Time decides fates
In time itself you create
The food you eat off your plate
In time itself you love and hate
And find a partner or some mates
Respect time, underrate it not
Don’t say ‘time passed, I forgot’
There is a time to be late
There is a time to debate
There is a time to wait for someone
Before time decides to shorten the fun
Remember time waits for no one
Time also catches up with those on the run
Respect time
The essence of time
Is its continuous presence
And its everlasting absence
And denial of the past tense

All these are here not for the sake of show
I realized and you called me loudly

Women must respect other women
Men and women must respect our children

I cannot fully fathom the unusualness of men
Mother Nature will remain eternally natural
Mothers will give birth to men and women
And the sky will forever be conventional.
Men must respect girls and boys
They are human too, not little toys
Women must respect boys and girls
Our tootses don’t belong to a world of swirls and twirls.
If we respect each other, our world will be natural
Loving, wonderful and exceptional
Love and respect are like fraternal twins
In such godly oasis, everyone wins.
Men must respect and care for each other
Women must follow a similar procedure
Life is beautiful, thanks to Mother Nature
Who always follows the Scriptures.
Our children need our help and divine lectures
Let’s love them and protect their future
Let’s chase the devils out of the manger
Let’s be brothers and sisters and love each other.

Men and women must respect our children."

Who to others do not grant me my due equality
Since equality to others is everybody's due
That is if to one's higher self one wish to remain true
Too many far too many support the inequality of rank
Our sadly flawed socities for such people we must thank
I cannot respect people who see fit to put me down
Far too many of their sort inhabit every town
These people not good people strange mind games they do play
They uphold rank and class distinction and create us against they
How can I respect people who like to pigeon hole
Those they look on as inferior in life this their chosen role
On who should be seen as important they like to have their say
They are small minded people small in their own small way."

If nights are totally dark
They have so much to spark
Offer peace and calm
To offer you rest with no harm
See the purpose and motives

Provided us with two options
Either go for it or disown
If you love both with same eyes
You need not think more and try
The heavenly bodies are there to look after
You finish the mission and depart thereafter"

580,Emotion,RespectPoemsNoRespectDudePoembyFrancisDuggan,"No respect dude the teenager said
Unhappy with me for not honouring the war dead
But his idea of what is respect is quite different to mine
He has his opinions and that suits me fine.
The making of a young soldier in some future day
To fight in a war from his homeland far away
For by his own admission that is all he aspires for to be
The heroes to him are not heroes to me.
Perhaps of emulating his ancestor the teenager does dream
But those he sees as heroes are not mine it does seem
My heroes believe in live and let live
And any perceived wrongs of the past are happy to forgive.
No respect dude words from one quite young
Perhaps one day too his praises will be sung
And though he may not survive to march in the war parade
At his grave site the last post for him will be played.
My advice to no respect dude is live long as you can
And forget about war live to be an old man
And watch your great grandchildren in the children's playground play
For life is for living as some are known to say."

and, the light it spreads reaches our eye
we forget the darkness, and think ourselves be blessed
Sun's power to light the glory world is self respect.
When rain enters our rooftop,
it doesnt ask whether you are rich or poor
the melody of the sweetness is for everybody
you may call it the rains self respect.
Wonderful stars are there in our sky
and they twinkle to make the sky looks like in a wedding gown
and, its sweetness is preserved in the fairy tales,
thats the self respect that the stars have.
when I mingled to write down a poetry,
thinking it to be my only work supported by my passion,
the happiness I get after make people smile,
thats certainly the self respect I give to myself."

588,Emotion,RespectPoemsLoveJoyTrustRespectPoembyTomZart,"We must bravely reject the deeds of the wicked
Which offer nothing but false pleasures and tears.
The Devil serves up his lies of mistrust
Plotting we'll remain prisoners of our fears.
When we fail to submit to the will of God
We pay attention to all the wrong voices.
We fall prey to deception and refuse to obey
The Lord's love to improve our choices
God's wisdom is measured by the outcomes of life
And how we keep our desires and untruths in check.
If we excuse our wrongs and always blame others
We suffer the loss of love, joy, trust and respect

589,Emotion,RespectPoemsIfYouRespectYourselfPoembyFrancisDuggan,"If You respect yourself respect to others you'll show
Never judge a person that you do not know
But your political leaders feel free to praise or to criticize
Since their decisions impact on you that you must realize
If you so wish you can heed or ignore my advice
Those with only personal power leave to their own device
Since any personal decisions they make do not impact on you
As you'd like them to treat you likewise to them do
Anyone if they so choose with their words can be unkind
And if you look for flaws in others then flaws you will find
Those kind with their words to their higher selves true
We receive from life what is only our due
Those into trash talking I for one don't condone
Let the one without sin come and cast the first stone."
590,Emotion,RespectPoemsRespectPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"All creatures deep inside are quite aware
that it's the heart and, with it, its sweet beat
only its never-ending flutter lets us share
a bit of time upon this planet, where we meet
so many creatures and, above all real humans
who all do strive to stay as long as they're allowed
they fiddle with their health and look at cardiac lumens
and hope the gods remember what the sheep have vowed.
There is a little thing that's often mentioned
it does concern our interpersonal communication
no matter, highly motivated or so well-intentioned
it's what may make us  give enough consideration
to one small word, and that is, vaguely, called respect.
Respect for the law
and for Ma and Pa,
for the crooked Police
for Canadian geese,
for the Judges and Preachers
and for needlework teachers
for the butchers and bakers
and the skilled coffinmakers,
for the nurses and bitches
and burglars and snitches
for all druggies and whores
and the owners of stores
thus, the list could continue
to a different venue
but suffice it to say
that respect is not play
and it can't be demanded
or delivered and handed
against payment of gold
no, respect can't be sold.
If your heart can take care
of necessities, bare
you can use all your time
to prepare and to climb
'til you reach Peak Respect
where you'll sit and reflect
and look inside your mind
where you possibly find
in the tangle of nerve
the respect you deserve."
591,Emotion,RespectPoemsRespectTheTerritoryPoembyVeeraiyahSubbulakshmi,"We are not the same human,
as we get experienced,
day by day non stop,
and we are not stagnant,
but flowing with the current,
holding hand to hand,
collecting memories of,
new relationship,
forgetting the old,
hurt and be hurt,
happy and let others to be happy.
at certain part of our life,
our sweet presence,
may become unnecessary,
to the loved ones,
so we have to pick up,
the courage and wisdom,
to draw the gentle demarcation,
where everyone will be the king and queen,
in their own territory."
592,Emotion,RespectPoemsRespectPoembyMichaelVestal,"First a great relationship is about two things, first,
Find out the similarities and second, respect the differences.
Respect is a two-way street, if you want to get it you have to give it
I have found if you respect yourself others will respect you
The secret of a happy life is respect.
Respect for yourself and respect for others
Love is honesty. Love is a mutual respect for one another
This generation has lost the true meaning of romance.
There are so many songs that disrespect women.
You can’t treat the woman you love as a piece of meat.
You should treat your love like a princess.
Give her love songs, something with real meaning.
Maybe I’m old fashioned but to respect the woman you love should be a priority.
Love is honesty. Love is a mutual respect for one another
And respect for ourselves guides our morals
Respect for others guides our manners
Two people can only live as one when each is prepared to give
And receive trust and understanding.
Above tha, t lies respect.
Without respect for how the other feels, no marriage is worthwhile
I respect another man’s religion, or color or creed.
I respect, and follow, the will of my maker.
I respect, the truth, no matter how unpopular.
I respect a good work ethic.
I respect the values on which this country was founded.
I respect, those who would champion the under privileged.
I respect those of differences, who seek common ground.
I respect those faithful to principal.
I respect, change, that is for the better.
I respect an honest day’s work.
I respect the great talents of the entertainment world.
I respect, thought provoking works, of the written word.
I respect the unquenchable thirst of creativity.
I respect the farmers and workers that toil in the field.
I respect the good in man.
I respect the virtue in woman.
I respect the innocence of children.
I respect the generosity of mankind.
Most of all I respect the maker of
life and the love, that each of us have within us."
593,Emotion,RespectPoemsSonnetRespectPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"Respect your elders all if they deserve;
Respect your servants too who you well serve;
Respect your father for tilling the soil;
Respect your mother for her love and toil.
Respect all teachers who gave you knowledge;
Respect your friend who saved you from the ledge;
Respect all good minds who advised you good;
Respect the man of God who gave soul’s food.
Respect all strangers who were all Godsends;
Respect your foes who taught you self-defense;
Respect those evil men who you troubled;
Respect the tempter who well you misled.
Respect your conscience which tells you what’s right;

594,Emotion,TruthPoemsWhenTruthBecomesTheEnemyPoembySarahLJohnsen,"There is no need to celebrate today.
There is no joy,  no promise with the sun.
Days are merely shadows that fade away.
Thoughts of what should have been have just begun.
Our lives were carefree just a while ago.
We had each other's love and it was clear
Our plans were fine and firm; our days would glow.
No folly or no foe could interfere.
In an instant fortune can be changed.
Cruel chance can cut and conquer the sublime.
No accident can be rearranged.
No prayer, faith or money can turn back time.
The Good are taken and their dreams are torn.
Pain rips my breath while fairness turns away.
Now, every path is barren and forlorn.
For you I mourn... until my dying day."

Ask help, in Jesus name

598,Emotion,TruthPoemsVersesOfTruthPoembyBobGotti,"This will stand the test of time, a poem of Truth with added rhyme,
They are Truths, from God’s Word; Bible Truths we all have heard.
And nothing has been added to, the words of Truth from me to you,
God’s the One to be stressed, and Christ who passes Eternal tests.
The Lord starts by giving life to us, creating all men out of the dust,
Creating man in the image of God, to put us over the earth we trod,
Over all the creatures that we see, created by The God of Eternity,
Created to live forever, to never die, up until Satan, to man had lied.
With man listening to Satan friend, his life on earth now would end,
And sin had brought an awful price, for man had to leave Paradise.
Shut out from God’s original plan, and all He had prepared for man,
And left to live out a temporal life, upon this earth of pain and strife.
For all received from God a curse, so all life ahead was only worse,
So now Adam like the rest of us, would soon return back to the dust.
But God’s Grace did rise above, sin’s awful curse through His Love,
Whom He would send to everyone, in Christ His Only Begotten Son.
Jesus Christ who died upon a cross, to pay sin’s price for all the lost.
By Satan’s lie men were deceived, but in God’s Son we can believe.
And with the rhymes in this poem, I point all to God’s Eternal Home,
Where all men can live Eternal Life, by faith in His Son Jesus Christ.

599,Emotion,TruthPoemsMeAndTeddyBearsTheTruthExclusivePoembyMichaelShepherd,"I’ve never owned a teddy bear (aw…)
my parents read the child-rearing bibles
of the time, maybe that’s what it was
but I’m not pleading deprivation or
mental abuse; into my life
came Rex the lion cub
we loved each other from the moment
I set eyes on him. We were about
the same age, that was taken for granted,
since he was my best friend and
of course, since I can’t compare
lion cubs with teddy bears since
I couldn’t at the time, I’m guessing
what the pros and cons might be:
Rex wasn’t someone you could easily
prop up on the pillow at the bed-head
and talk to – he didn’t do talking-to
since he had an existence independent of me
but on the other hand
he loved to be rolled around with
with his prickly whiskers
and good nature, with the reassurance
that he was a lion, small but already
with very practical paws and would
protect me if required; his eyes were always ready for fun yet
very much set on what was ahead.
I think lion cubs are a fair match for teddies
but I would say that wouldn’t I
there was probably a difficult time
when I fell in love with Pooh Bear
for life
but I’ve blocked that out
and my parents (child-rearing books again)
were very clever at removing toys at
the ‘right’ moment to enable their child
to grow up. Well that failed.
But Rex did prepare me
psychologically for
that first puppy who
welcomed me unhesitatingly
into his life
but just recently, to celebrate
my second childhood
I’ve taken to wondering if
it’s not too late to acquire
a teddy bear
but no taking the first one offered thanks:
I’ve become a bit of a connoisseur
rather like signing up with
a marriage bureau: OK but
there may be better
around the corner...
I wander discreetly (‘It’s for my niece…’)
round department stores
with all their vulgar rubbish,
charity shops with their loved, furry balding spotted
survivors hoping for
a second happy marriage
or happier
looking carefully at their expressions
full-face, side view
(Good God, are their manufacturers aware
of the diff’rence ‘twixt bear and bear?)
wondering if it’s The One
please keep this to yourself ‘cos
I don’t want my friends fixing me up
with some merry widow(er)   of a bear
just because they’re sorry for the old git
I’ll take my time thanks
since I’d like to think
my previous partners will approve my choice
after all it’s for life and
we older and wiser ones have
so much to offer"

on the edge of my

I fiddle and fidget

There is

in a tranquil

catching the rays
of the green sun
in my desert dreams.
You have to wonder
(my reader)
whether there
is any point
to a woman’s man,
ladies’ man,
man’s man
gay’s man
no-one’s man
living in this
dust of clog,
arteries and

organs all
working to complicate
one another.
The night is
holding it’s torch
soaring in the sky
looking down on

dead man
is still awake.
You could say
that I stumbled
upon the only certainty.

601,Emotion,TruthPoemsARareTruthPoembyUzmaJamil,"Bloom could the cherries no more,
The haste that burdened,
Made visionary the sight,
Restrictions frequent but pure,
Had not known,
The cold bare winter tree,
That stood all day long,
To which history had shared the secret.
Once it happened so,
A bird wingless sought shelter too,
For the black ghosty witch had entered,
And into the button staid eyes,
The irony lay, the heart shivered,
Till the fear traveled and made cold the bones,
The weighty burden was carried,
Until downloading lightened the shoulders,
The sky shone making the air sweet,
And the lips smiled with the curves of joy,
All was seen a rare truth of dependent history."

603,Emotion,TruthPoemsUncoverTheTruthPoembyJenniferRondeau,"Sometime I think life is over,
But when I look behind your eyes I can uncover the truth you hide,
The lies you told me,
The things I believed,
But you never knew I can uncover your lies you have told me,
Uncover your dirty little secret you hide,
The deaths you have upon me will never end,
The lies you have told others will never end,
Its hard to believe the one you love can lie to you and shatter your heart into million pieces,
I have uncover the truth I seek,
Uncover the hate I feel,
You lead me to believe you are the one I love,
Lead me to think I loved you,
But in the end I get my heart broken."
604,Emotion,TruthPoemsTruthIsStrangerThanFrictionPoembyMichaelShepherd,"The joy of truth is
that it can be funnier,

On September 16 the referee
suspended a football match

that the players on both

multiracial teams
had been racially abusing each other
with terms like 'black bastard'
a player corrected this, explaining
that it wasn't racial abuse but
'sledging' - to put off
players from kicking penalties etc.:
'Sure it was abuse, but there
was no racism'

605,Emotion,TruthPoemsAgeOfTruthPoembyCharlesMMoore,"In younger times, A boy was I
I loved the earth and loved the sky
an innocent of times gone by
an infant to the world
I grew up strong and grew up fast
and soon a youth with little past
but felt that all was in my grasp
the world could do no wrong
Developing my social skill
became a favourite of the girls
I plunged in deeply to the thrills
the world was mine alone
I sought stability at last
and settled down from hectic past
with marriage vows and bankers draft
a new world would be born
The time was spent before I knew
the marriage gone the children grew
aquaintances now just a few
the world had surely changed
In older times, A man am I
I love the earth and love the sky
an innocent from times gone by
to face the world alone."
606,Emotion,TruthPoems0405TheMountainOfTruthPoembyMichaelShepherd,"This bloody poetry writing - it's like rock-climbing -
who asked you to, anyway?
who needs it?
why can't you be just like everyone else -
admire the mountain from afar,
Olympus, Parnassus, whatever, what's in a  name?
its cap of snow, the way you often can't see the top
for mist; like romance around truth.
Homer at the top saw gods - shall you?
But no -
it's a fine summer morning
and you get the urge to see the view from the top;
well fine, but that's not enough for you,
no going up the standard route for you, oh no,
you want to be the first to get to the top by
a new route never attempted before...
so there you are an hour or two later, at the grassy foot
safe in your skin and about to risk your life
(and your reputation, you conceited little man)
and off we go...
the rockface, truth itself (and did you give a single thought
to how that was built, or who might have built it?)
and you with this tiny, hot ambition;
but take it calmly now, word by word, or you're in trouble
and it's a banal climbdown for anyone to see and read.
and it's not as if anyone is going to appreciate
the difficulty of your climb
without doing it themself; and taste the exhilaration,
the selfish, lonely, glorious exhilaration
as you gain the top, and gaze at the heart-stirring, breeze-blessed view
as if you are for those few minutes before other thoughts creep in,
the master of your universe...
but beware, even the climb down you now face
back to the plains of everyday
may be a sterner test - humility may even
cross your mind, as you recall each step
that that same rockface of the truth
that challenged all your skills to master,
saved your life every step,  by its every ancient crack and crevice
so conveniently provided by nature and those millions upon millions
of seashells that built this truthful mountain...
and now, you're back on the level plain of everyday -
are you going to keep it quiet, or tell the world?
'Look, there's the mountain I climbed! ' 'Yes, I saw it
in the paper - how's the wife? ' And though
it'll be recorded in the books, the later editions will point out
that yes it was the first, but that was before the first
girl did it by that route, the first child,
the first man did it barefoot,
the first blind man did it from memory...
yes you'll feel good, yes you'll feel a bigger man,
yes you'll be a better climber for it,
yes your fellow climbers
will treat your name with respect,
yes they'll read it in the books,
but they'll never know, unless they try it,
how it felt at every risky step,
the holds you didn't take for caution's sake
on that rockface of truth,
what went through your mind or got blotted out.
But you'll know. And that's enough for you.
Personal satisfaction. And the hope
that your book about it will touch others,
even sell well. Your heart's in it -
what more can you ask?
This bloody poetry-writing."
607,Emotion,TruthPoemsTheTruthBetweenUsPoembyjohntiongchunghoo,"so familiar
an echo
an echo
from my heart
i turn to look
and the years
that carve that
emptiness
large as cave
sprout legs to
run to me
and my mind
rushes to embrace the
most endearing ones

608,Emotion,TruthPoemsTheOneSureTruthPoembyWillThomas,"In the long, narrow hall of home,
hangs a bleached and fading picture of four-year-old me:
holding hands with his bushy browed grampa,
wearing one of those plaid wool caps
that kids always used to wear
and a button up sweater
with reindeer stitched into it.
This me
searches the lens of the camera,
smiling sweetly,
the skin above his ears white and shy from a fresh haircut,
so innocent as to be almost foolish.
And tiptoeing the barbed wire of melancholy,
I'd like to tell that me some things,
in his grampa's backyard,
in Rochester, New York,
in 1951.
I'd warn him that living hurts,
that there are hard things out there:
bruised hearts,
screaming accidents,
sirens in the night,
people he loves ripped from the earth,
flimsy, gray funerals,
gone dreams.
I'd whisper that there is an emptiness out there-
deep and swirling
and black enough
to shatter the soul.
I'd remind him to look both ways before crossing,
and to dress warmly when the cold days come.
I'd tell him to take care.
'Be careful, ' I'd beg.
'Please...be careful.'
He would not hear.
He smiles sweetly.
(I can do nothing for him.)
Life found him.
That was always
the one sure truth
in the backyards of Rochester,
in the summer of the fireflies,
in 1951.
So, there is only this left:
I have come, somehow, to love that boy.
I'd like him to know.

609,Emotion,TruthPoemsTheThreadOfTruthPoembyArthurHughClough,"Truth is a golden thread, seen here and there
In small bright specks upon the visible side
Of our strange being's parti-coloured web.
How rich the universe! 'Tis a vein of ore
Emerging now and then on Earth's rude breast,
But flowing full below. Like islands set
At distant intervals on Ocean's face,
We see it on our course; but in the depths
The mystic colonnade unbroken keeps
Its faithful way, invisible but sure.
Oh, if it be so, wherefore do we men
Pass by so many marks, so little heeding?"

Passively abusing and complicit

611,Emotion,TruthPoemsWinesTruthAQuandaryOfLovePoembyHughCobb,"in vino veritas
so goes the phrase
& so t'would seem to be:
Mind can lie; heart cannot.
& when mind keeps heart
under lock & key
then wine can seem
a welcome thief
opening lock'd heart
letting it speak its truth.
Thus my quandary:
Because I love you
I long to hear those words,
so sweet, echo'd back to me.
But at its killing cost
a price too high
& one I'd never ask.
For your heart's true song
is known to me
& though I might wish
you could pick heart's lock
or someday your mind
be a willing key,
I'd rather have you
be icy cold to me
than cold & dead & I bereft:
The grave's no place for your beauty, love
nor for your kind & loving heart
You mean so much to me.
My curse, you see, is to love you.
(I have e'er since we met.)
& I know what your heart feels
though mind can never speak.
Which is why I've never
closed my own:
open my heart & vulnerable
it leaves me little choice.
For I can naught but love you
e'en with your heart's truth unvoiced.
& once cross'd over to other side
our masks & roles shall be
dropp'd like useless toys
freeing our shining spirits
who shall embrace & know true joy.
but as for now, that old saw's truth
must sustain me & suffice
as my heart alone shall sing her tune aloud
and I stand, Aphrodite's sacrifice.

That she (dear She) might take some pleasure of my pain:
Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know,
Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain;
I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe,
Studying inventions fine, her wits to entertain:
Oft turning others' leaves, to see if thence would flow
Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sun-burn'd brain.
But words came halting forth, wanting Invention's stay,
Invention, Nature's child, fled step-dame Study's blows,
And others' feet still seem'd but strangers in my way.

Biting my truant pen, beating myself for spite--

Deep In The  Valley Of Pain.

Deception Ends
Peering into the depth of darkness,

619,Emotion,TruthPoemsLovingInTruthAndFainInVerseMyLoveToShowPoembySirPhilipSidney,"Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show,
That She, dear She, might take some pleasure of my pain,
—Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know,
Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain—
I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe,
Studying inventions fine, her wits to entertain,
Oft turning others' leaves, to see if thence would flow
Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburnt brain.
But words came halting forth, wanting Invention's stay;
Invention, Nature's child, fled step-dame Study's blows;
And others' feet still seemed but strangers in my way.
Thus, great with child to speak, and helpless in my throes,
Biting my truant pen, beating myself for spite—
""Fool!"" said my Muse to me ""look in thy heart, and write!"""
620,Emotion,TruthPoems0051TheBlackbirdOfTruthPoembyMichaelShepherd,"Waiting for the train, listening
to the blackbird singing
across the railway line
I whistled a musical game with it
of call and response,
variations, show-off riffs;
the blackbird listened,
held its head a little to one side,
crisply hopped onto the iron rail
and I thought myself mighty clever
as we played our musical game, and
it flew across the line, a few yards nearer,
swiftly, with clear intention
onto the platform two yards from me
and the whole world turned on me
as I realised I had no idea
whether it was playing at
blackbird makes friends with man
or whether it was planning
a swift dart at this rival’s eyes
and I felt humble, stupid, ashamed, and yes scared,
to have intruded in this blackbird’s life;
stopped whistling, turned away
and pretended it was just a game,
knowing now
it wasn’t."
621,Emotion,TruthPoemsFaceToTruthPoembyOldAmsterdam,"I was so tied to play this game
I never found my situation without pain
Why you put me in?
I thought that we are all to blame
I'm the man from the outside
People think that I'm a stupid guy
I'm a good player in the other game
But why now I feelany shame?
Why you try to put the wheel on the ship?
Why you want to make the unkonws to believed?
Just face to truth
And we'll know what we lose
If you and I could make it better
Let me back to my space
On the start line of my red life
I will rebirth...
...
The world let me down
Should I change it all
Or back home?
...
A man always half to success and half to fail"

Pe la strada che pporta a la Salara,
C'è in nell'entrà una cosa benedetta.
Pe ttutta Roma quant'è larga e stretta
Nun poterai trovà cosa ppiù rara.

Chi ha detta la bucìa, chi nu l'ha detta.

Je ce metto una mano, e nu la striggne
La verità da me ttiella pe certa.

In a church, in a small square
Shortly after Montanara Square [2] ,
Along the road leading to the salt-works,
As soon as you enter there's something holy.
In all Rome far and wide
You could not find something as rare as that.
It's a face of stone, which tells
Who is a lier and who is not.
If in the mouth of this statue, which is open,
I insert my hand and it does not clasp it,
Consider my truth as most reliable.
But if a lier inserts his hand
Be sure that, push or pull,
That hand won't come out."
624,Emotion,TruthPoemsTheTruthWillGiveYouLovePoembykwaneLamb,"Love is wise, but how wise?
Real love can live without the magic of sex?
Love is the wisdom of two people
Sex is the lust of many
A woman the gift...a wise person
Understands less sex.
Women are not always willing to be on there back
A relationship is not a running track
But a place to be laid and admired from the sack.
A man as I was told... is bold for the female hole
Wisdom did him no good...
Born for sex from the hood...
Ride'em, feed'em, and Puck'em
That is how it was told
But the wisdom of the gift
Put into man a shift...
Now most men see love with both eyes and hope
Instead of with one eye and the hole as dope.
The gift is a shadow of a man's smile..
A woman's love is the wisdom we both learn to live and grow with
Now that most men understand that woman is woman
And man is man...Let us try to do the best we can....
Less sex on demand.

625,Emotion,TruthPoemsDarkTruthPoembyRobertWilliamService,"Birds have no consciousness of doom:
Yon thrush that serenades me daily
From scented snow of hawthorn bloom
Would not trill out his glee so gaily,
Could he foretell his songful breath
Would sadly soon be stilled in death.
Yon lambs that frolic on the lea
And incarnate the joy of life,
Would scarce disport them could they see
The shadow of the butcher's knife:
Oh Nature, with your loving ruth,
You spare them knowledge of Dark Truth.
To sad humanity alone,
(Creation's triumph ultimate)
The grimness of the grave is known,
The dusty destiny await . . . .
Oh bird and beast, with joy, elance
Effulgently your ingorance!
Oh man, previsioning the hearse,
With fortitude accept your curse!"
626,Emotion,TruthPoemsTheTruthIsBlindPoembyDavidGascoyne,"The light fell from the window and the day was done
Another day of thinking and distractions
Love wrapped in its wings passed by and coal-black Hate
Paused on the edge of the cliff and dropped a stone
From which the night grew like a savage plant
With daggers for its leaves and scarlet hearts
For flowers - then the bed
Rose clocklike from the ground and spread its sheets
Across the shifting sands
Autumnal breath of mornings far from here
A star veiled in grey mist
A living man:
The snapping of a dry twig was his only announcement. The two men, who had tied their boat to a branch that grew out over the water's edge, and were now moving up through the rank tropical vegetation, turned sharply.
He raised his eyes and saw the river's source
Between their legs - he saw the flaming sun
He saw the buildings in between the leaves
Behind their heads that were as large as globes
He heard their voices indistinct as rain
As faint as feathers falling
And he fell
The boat sailed on
The masts were made of straw
The sails were made of finest silken thread
And out of holes on either side the prow
Gushed endless streams of water and of flame
In which the passengers saw curious things:
The conjurer, we are told, 'took out of his bag a silken thread, and so projected it upwards that it stuck fast in a certain cloud of air. Out of the same receptacle he pulled a hare, that ran away up along the thread; a little beagle, which when it was slipped at the hare pursued it in full cry; last of all a small dogboy, whom he commanded to follow both hare and hound up the thread. From another bag that he had he extracted a winsome young woman, at all points well adorned, and instructed her to follow after hound and dogboy.'
She laughed to see them gazing after her
She clapped her hands and vanished in thin air
To reappear upon the other bank
Among the restless traffic of the quays
Her silhouette against the dusty sky
Her shadow falling on the hungry stones
Where sat the pilot dressed in mud-stained rags
He knocked the fragile statue down
And ate her sugar head
And then the witnesses all gathered round
And pointed at the chasm at his feet:
Clouds of blue smoke, sometimes mixed with black, were being emitted from the exhaust pipe. The smoke was of sufficient density to be an annoyance to the driver following the vehicle or to pedestrians.
The whispering of unseen flames
A sharp taste in the mouth."
627,Emotion,TruthPoemsSonnet138WhenMyLoveSwearsThatSheIsMadeOfTruthPoembyWilliamShakespeare,"When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her, though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
Unlearnèd in the world's false subtleties.
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
Although she knows my days are past the best,
Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue;
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed.
But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
And wherefore say not I that I am old?
O, love's best habit is in seeming trust,
And age in love, loves not to have years told.
Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,
And in our faults by lies we flattered be."

Never hiding nor holding back,

Powerful light energy,

Or sleep by the brook?

Don't blame it on Fate,
Take control of your future
Before it's too late."

But can cause the hearer to wince

With all being accepted now.

637,Emotion,TruthPoemsBluntTruthOrSweetLiesPoembyRajaramRamachandran,"Quite often sweet lies,
Almost every one likes
And a blunt truth
Leads one to wrath.
Every one, guilt-free,
Any time, wants to be.
So they resort to lies,
To cover their faults.
'Me, the thorn pricked, '
Thus, the thorn is blamed,
And not the one stepped
O'er it, enroute, unnoticed.
'My Lord, a coin you spare, '
Prays a beggar to a miser,
Praising him as a donor
Just to fill up his hunger.
'Oh, you're a source of joy'
Says a henpecked hubby
Facing her usual fry
That makes him almost cry.
Can he stay with his wife,
Peacefully under one roof?
Lie comes to his rescue here,
For him to live sans any fear.
A lie saves a nation sometime,
Be it diplomacy, its other name.
One can lie to save a life
From falling into a strife.
How many lies under an oath
Do come up to cover the truth
In His Lordship's Court,
To save a guilty from guilt?
Thanks to all the sweet lies
For saving many battles
And keeping all souls happy,
Under the cloud of hypocrisy."

Beauty through the eye's beholder made

shine well beyond the veil where night and day
frame shadow-shapes that slip away, afraid.
Beyond time's rhyme shines Beauty as obeyed

each unique however short their stay,
yet each to each conjoined as love, light weighed
Between life's lines as silk skein all adore,
Beauty's theme whose waves wash timeless shore.
Modest maiden bashful blinks,
blushing beauty cream the rose

cannot compete with light that links
across time lines as life-force flows
to ransom Time while Brahma winks.
Beauty spans life's cycle spinning through
word, deed, and act, both outer, inner, form,
may, drawn though space, enchant, and thus inform
the common mortal magic must ring true.
Beauty spirals through straight lines to cue
into life's circus circle, shine and storm,
night, day, rest play, surpass codes cuniform.
All may show glow's flow, flow's glow, renew

we knew before, will after know, as norm

In my clever world it’s lying which rules
Why opt for something as silly as sincerity
When you can easily choose dishonesty
Then you can tell lies upon lies upon lies
So many out there for you to devise
And believe them yourself, very nearly, why not
You weaved such an interesting, exciting plot
The truth, big deal, the truth is nothing but lies
My truth’s so much better, at least in my eyes
My lies versus the truth, so easy to win
Because I can keep lying ad nauseum
I’ll just spout out a lie, how easy was that
Don’t look for the truth in my kind of chat
You think I’ll be discovered, I’m way too smart
I’ll never say what’s there in my heart
My heart was stunted a long time ago
All this lying stopped any chance it could grow
When you don’t speak from your heart, it’s hard to see
The difference between truth and dishonesty

Too soon lonely in the darkness of the night.
Afraid, crying, hurting out of sight.
No one knows how hard one must fight.
Brave they are to those around them, trying
not to break the silence of what is really
haunting them. A pillar of strength for all to be
in awe, when deep inside there is a flaw.
They walk with dignity for all to see, but
oh too soon will fall to their knees
Sobbing uncontrollably, with such anxiety.
Quivering, not wanting to mix with society
Out of their shell, they crawl in early morn
To show a facade that can be adored
The truth must not prevail, what life really
does entail.
Their fear of truth must never be told.
It is a secret, hidden deep within the soul.

Thy boundless love can give.

About my path to shine;
But chiefly long to walk with Thee,
And only trust in Thine.
In holy expectation held,
Thy strength my heart shall stay,
For Thy right hand will never let
My trust be cast away.
Yea, Thou hast kept me near Thy feet,
In many a deadly strife,
By the stronghold of hope in Thee,
The hope of endless life.
Thou knowest that I am not blest
As Thou wouldst have me be,
Till all the peace and joy of faith
Possess my soul in Thee
And still I seek ’mid many fears,
With yearnings unexpressed,
The comforts of Thy strengthening love,
Thy soothing, settling rest.
It is not as Thou wilt with me,
Till, humbled in the dust;
I know no place in all my heart
Wherein to put my trust.
Until I find, O Lord, in Thee,
The Lowly and the Meek,
That fullness which Thy own redeemed
Go nowhere else to seek.
Then, O my Savior, on my soul,
Cast down, but not dismayed,
Still be Thy chastening, healing hand

My yearning heart to fill,
Teach me to walk and work with Thee,
And at Thy feet sit still."

In vain I've sought thee all around,
But thy unfashionable sound
In crowds was never heard,
Nor ever has thy form in town or court appear'd.
The sanctuary is not safe to thee,
Chas'd thence by endless mystery;
Thy own professors chase thee thence,
And wage eternal war with thee and sense;
Then in perplexing comments lost,
E'en when they would be thought to show the most.

There thou may'st reign, unrivall'd and alone,

654,Emotion,TruthPoemsTruthPoembyFrancesEllenWatkinsHarper,"A rock, for ages, stern and high,
Stood frowning 'gainst the earth and sky,
And never bowed his haughty crest
When angry storms around him prest.
Morn, springing from the arms of night,
Had often bathed his brow with light.
And kissed the shadows from his face
With tender love and gentle grace.
Day, pausing at the gates of rest,
Smiled on him from the distant West,
And from her throne the dark-browed Night
Threw round his path her softest light.
And yet he stood unmoved and proud,
Nor love, nor wrath, his spirit bowed;
He bared his brow to every blast
And scorned the tempest as it passed.
One day a tiny, humble seed --
The keenest eye would hardly heed --
Fell trembling at that stern rock's base,
And found a lowly hiding-place.
A ray of light, and drop of dew,
Came with a message, kind and true;
They told her of the world so bright,
Its love, its joy, and rosy light,
And lured her from her hiding-place,
To gaze upon earth's glorious face.
So, peeping timid from the ground,
She clasped the ancient rock around,
And climbing up with childish grace,
She held him with a close embrace;
Her clinging was a thing of dread;
Where'er she touched a fissure spread,
And he who'd breasted many a storm
Stood frowning there, a mangled form;
A Truth, dropped in the silent earth,
May seem a thing of little worth,
Till, spreading round some mighty wrong,
It saps its pillars proud and strong,
And o'er the fallen ruin weaves
The brightest blooms and fairest leaves."

From some other God, perhaps a friend of his

Because it would mean, that he was in that case
Just one of  two or three Gods out there in space
Raising the question of who was there first
Where did the others come from?
Perhaps near Chislelhurst?
And then one could ask, where did the others go?
But that's a very difficult question to answer, you know

656,Emotion,TruthPoemsTheSimpleTruthPoembyPhilipLevine,"I bought a dollar and a half's worth of small red potatoes,
took them home, boiled them in their jackets
and ate them for dinner with a little butter and salt.
Then I walked through the dried fields
on the edge of town.  In middle June the light
hung on in the dark furrows at my feet,
and in the mountain oaks overhead the birds
were gathering for the night, the jays and mockers
squawking back and forth, the finches still darting
into the dusty light.  The woman who sold me
the potatoes was from Poland; she was someone
out of my childhood in a pink spangled sweater and sunglasses
praising the perfection of all her fruits and vegetables
at the road-side stand and urging me to taste
even the pale, raw sweet corn trucked all the way,
she swore, from New Jersey.  ""Eat, eat"" she said,
""Even if you don't I'll say you did.""
Some things
you know all your life.  They are so simple and true
they must be said without elegance, meter and rhyme,
they must be laid on the table beside the salt shaker,
the glass of water, the absence of light gathering
in the shadows of picture frames, they must be
naked and alone, they must stand for themselves.
My friend Henri and I arrived at this together in 1965
before I went away, before he began to kill himself,
and the two of us to betray our love.  Can you taste
what I'm saying?  It is onions or potatoes, a pinch
of simple salt, the wealth of melting butter, it is obvious,
it stays in the back of your throat like a truth
you never uttered because the time was always wrong,
it stays there for the rest of your life, unspoken,
made of that dirt we call earth, the metal we call salt,
in a form we have no words for, and you live on it."
657,Emotion,TruthPoemsMaskingTheTruthPoembyceceliawarner,"My life was based
on masking the truth,
not allowed to express feelings
buried throughout my youth.
'Don't tell others
what goes on behind closed doors, '
still masking the truth
and developing sores.
As time passed,
as time always does,
what was masking the truth,
still is, as it was...
I'm not talking about
telling big or even little white lies,
I'm tallking about masking pain
through silence and lying eyes.
If all this seems too confusing
then try walking in my shoes...
It feels just as confusing
because these are not the feelings I'd choose!
Most of my life,
the reason or situation didn't matter,
the mask would go up
as I feel my sanity shatter."
658,Emotion,TruthPoemsAllIsTruthPoembyWaltWhitman,"O ME, man of slack faith so long!
Standing aloof--denying portions so long;
Only aware to-day of compact, all-diffused truth;
Discovering to-day there is no lie, or form of lie, and can be none,
but grows as inevitably upon itself as the truth does upon
itself,
Or as any law of the earth, or any natural production of the earth
does.
(This is curious, and may not be realized immediately--But it must be
realized;
I feel in myself that I represent falsehoods equally with the rest,
And that the universe does.)
Where has fail'd a perfect return, indifferent of lies or the truth?
Is it upon the ground, or in water or fire? or in the spirit of man?
or in the meat and blood?                                    10
Meditating among liars, and retreating sternly into myself, I see
that there are really no liars or lies after all,
And that nothing fails its perfect return--And that what are called
lies are perfect returns,
And that each thing exactly represents itself, and what has preceded
it,
And that the truth includes all, and is compact, just as much as
space is compact,
And that there is no flaw or vacuum in the amount of the truth--but
that all is truth without exception;
And henceforth I will go celebrate anything I see or am,
And sing and laugh, and deny nothing."
659,Emotion,TruthPoemsALegendOfTruthPoembyRudyardKipling,"Once on a time, the ancient legends tell,
Truth, rising from the bottom of her well,
Looked on the world, but, hearing how it lied,
Returned to her seclusion horrified.
There she abode, so conscious of her worth,
Not even Pilate's Question called her forth,
Nor Galileo, kneeling to deny
The Laws that hold our Planet 'neath the sky.
Meantime, her kindlier sister, whom men call
Fiction, did all her work and more than all,
With so much zeal, devotion, tact, and care,
That no one noticed Truth was otherwhere.
Then came a War when, bombed and gassed and mined,
Truth rose once more, perforce, to meet mankind,
And through the dust and glare and wreck of things,
Beheld a phantom on unbalanced wings,
Reeling and groping, dazed, dishevelled, dumb,
But semaphoring direr deeds to come.
Truth hailed and bade her stand; the quavering shade
Clung to her knees and babbled, ""Sister, aid!
I am--I was--thy Deputy, and men
Besought me for my useful tongue or pen
To gloss their gentle deeds, and I complied,
And they, and thy demands, were satisfied.
But this--"" she pointed o'er the blistered plain,
Where men as Gods and devils wrought amain--
""This is beyond me! Take thy work again.""
Tablets and pen transferred, she fled afar,
And Truth assumed the record of the War...
She saw, she heard, she read, she tried to tell
Facts beyond precedent and parallel--
Unfit to hint or breathe, much less to write,
But happening every minute, day and night.
She called for proof. It came. The dossiers grew.
She marked them, first, ""Return. This can't be true.""
Then, underneath the cold official word:
""This is not really half of what occurred.""
She faced herself at last, the story runs,
And telegraphed her sister: ""Come at once.
Facts out of hand. Unable overtake
Without your aid. Come back for Truth's own sake!
Co-equal rank and powers if you agree.
They need us both, but you far more than me!"""
660,Emotion,TruthPoemsAnAdmissionOfTruthPoembyDavidTaylor,"Now here’s a short poem
that I oft thought of showing.
A bit of a lark,
or a thing of the dark?
Above all an admission of truth.
Now I’ve joined you all here
for less than a year.
On this journey so dear,
of poems diverse and astute.
Of feelings sublime that sometimes do rhyme.
Of anger and angst, or a grievance to hoot.
Well I have to admit
that I sometimes do dream,
of the style and the wit,
to make you all swoon, and to gasp,
with each brilliant line that I’ve writ.
I think to myself in a self centred way,
what have I to say that can give,
you all an experience, you’ll never forget.
A verse so sublime
that never with time
will it loose its importance.
Not even in death!
Well if I find it I’m sure
you’ll be the first to endure
the full force of its eloquent depth.
But until then and for now the best I can do
is this sorry attempt, at a poem with serious intent.
And if it cannot aspire to set you on fire,
I hope that at least you’re content.
And perhaps, well maybe, you have to admit,
there’s a poem, or two, you wish you had writ."
661,Emotion,TruthPoemsTheOneFalseTruthPoembyMatthewHyatt,"The darkness surrounds me
fills the void and caresses my skin
encouraging me to rise and sin
my mind turns ashen and corrupts my thoughts
gossiping about would be not
I was once revered by the sick and the old
now all I have left is the cold
The darkness engulfs me
In my wake I drain happy thoughts
Leaving morals to sit and rot
dealing with those who would rather not.
'Your a monster' they say with a mob at their side
alone by themselves they would run and hide
A wake of destruction follows me by my stride
lands charred black, rivers boiled
The hard work of man soiled
My rise to the top is bloody and fast
The public knowing my reign will not last
Those who oppse are often bloodied
I have been extensively studied
The darkness becomes me
They fear me, hate me, want to destroy me
All because I took away their lives that were free
A bullet to the head,
I rise from the dead
Proclaimed as the one
Deeds like mine are rarely done
So begins my apocalyptic reign
I am the darness"
662,Emotion,TruthPoemsTheTruthPoembyRavenKeller,"Theres no sense in running
You cant hide from the nightmare forever
Don't you feel the breathe of death?
Don't you understand that you'll never get better?
Can you feel the world watching?
Accusing eyes, plotting your demise
Can you tell that no ones listening?
No gentle hand, to help you stand
Learn to laugh when you're fading
Learn to lie when you're in pain
Learn to smile when you're drowning
Learn to be pretend when you're no longer sane"
663,Emotion,TruthPoemsTheTruthOfWomanPoembySirWalterScott,"Woman's faith, and woman's trust -
Write the characters in the dust;
Stamp them on the running stream,
Print them on the moon's pale beam,
And each evanescent letter
Shall be clearer, firmer, better,
And more permanent, I ween,
Than the thing those letters mean.
I have strain'd the spider's thread
'Gainst the promise of a maid;
I have weigh'd a grain of sand
'Gainst her plight of heart and hand;
I told my true love of the token,
How her faith proved light, and her word was broken:
Again her word and truth she plight,
And I believed them again ere night."
664,Emotion,TruthPoemsMasksOfTruthPoembyMatthewHyatt,"I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
Cast off the masks and let emotions fly
Let the false self die
Hear the sound of the falling rain
The rain to cleanse the brain
Everyone has a mask
To perform a different task
Hiding misery, regret, and pain
With a forced smile or gleam
Hoping it's only a bad dream
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives"

to that place of lesser resistance,
where inertia rests,
and there is no danger.
Places with our names written on them.
We think they are the things we love,
our lullabies.
But dreams chase us,
they wear costumes,
they call us “ liar ”, “coward”.
They shout our misery.
They are beasts waiting
for their freedom
or their banquet
under our pillows"
667,Emotion,TruthPoemsTruthIsWhatTruthIsPoembyGajananMishra,"Truth is what truth is
Truth is feeling, truth is living
Truth is the realization of life.
Let us live in Truth
Truth in quality and in quantity
Let us discover truth in entire forming.
It is a fact, nothing lacks in Truth
Truth is the beginning and truth is the ending
And in between we find only truth
Nothing but the truth.
It is the vision that is truth
It is the knowledge that is truth
The path is the truth, the opinion is the truth
And we find the love and the life-drama in love is only Truth."
668,Emotion,TruthPoemsTheTruthInYouPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"I seek the truth in you
The weak lie is not you
So speak up, yes you
The truth hurts but it works
The truth simplifies and dignifies
The truth sooths preserving your youth
I ask the truth of you
Cry now, take a tissue
So speak up, yes you
The truth signifies and modifies
The truth is within and the best way to begin
The truth is a good start especially for sweethearts
I need the truth of you
Simply choose your venue
So speak up, yes you
The truth to any degree
Is a starting point to be free
Just like one and two make three
So speak up, yes you
If you agree

669,Emotion,TruthPoemsIfTruthInHeartsThatPerishPoembyAlfredEdwardHousman,"If truth in hearts that perish
Could move the powers on high,
I think the love I bear you
Should make you not to die.
Sure, sure, if stedfast meaning,
If single thought could save,
The world might end to-morrow,
You should not see the grave.
This long and sure-set liking,
This boundless will to please,
--Oh, you should live for ever,
If there were help in these.
But now, since all is idle,
To this lost heart be kind,
Ere to a town you journey
Where friends are ill to find."

No one can defame it,

So, there is nothing to worry,
Be happy and joyous,
Truth is definitely prevailing in this beautiful world."

673,Emotion,TruthPoemsNightmareInTruthPoembyLauraCummings,"When the darkness creeps in,
And I can feel the cool wind breathing on the back of my neck,
I think of you to keep sane,
My life
My steady rock.
Then sleep overwhelms me,
And things are happening which I do not control,
Although being aware that I am only sleeping,
I can not force myself to wake,
I can not move,
The fear is overwhelming,
I’m frozen
Unable to move
Unable to scream
Unable to even close my eyes.
So I have to watch,
Unable to do anything to save you,
Blood once innocent flows free,
Suddenly there are other people around while all of this is happening,
But they’re not helping you
They’re not even looking at you
They’re looking at me
Looking with dark accusing eyes
‘How could you let this happen’
How could I let this happen
Again."
674,Emotion,TruthPoemsTruthQuotWithAnApologyToShakespearePoembyDrElbertRMosesJr,"To see, or not to see, that is the problem;
Whether 'tis easier in this life to suffer
The barbs and jabs of unthinking citizens,
Or to marshal your forces against your foes,
And by resisting stop them? To struggle to weep;
No more; and by struggle to say to assuage
The heartache and the thousand inward struggles
That man is heir to, 'tis culmination
Fervently to be desired. To struggle to weep;
To weep; maybe to think: ay, there's the rub;
For in the weeping that drowns the sorrow
When you succumb to life here on earth,
Must present our cause; There's truth's impact
That makes chaos of so long a life;
For who is left to bear the taunts and jibes of time,
The abuser of power, the educators pleas,
The pangs of trampled truth, the endless trails,
The decisions in smoke filled rooms and the cries
Of those unworthy to think.
Truth will out! Truth will out!
But what is to be, will be.
Just what is transpiring at the Congressional level in our government! I thought that this poem might be worth considering."

Total merger of benevolence!"

Truth cannot expound
Everything is vanity

with ebony tusks uncover
wounds that would not heal"
678,Emotion,TruthPoemsTheTruthPoembyScarlet,"the truth is what you ask for
you ask if I’m ok
you ask why I’m so distant
so, what should I say
should I tell you I’m suffering
or should I just say im ok
because that would be a lie
to say I’m ok
I’m far from ok
you say you want the truth
but I know you won; t understand the truth
I just don; t know if I can tell you the truth
or if I should
for the last person I had this conversation with
blow up in  my face
I thought she would understand
she said she would but she didn’t
I haven't seen her since that day
you turn to me again
and ask again
for the truth
I turn and tell you I don't know why I’m so distant
but I’m ok
I say its just me
its just how I am
what a lie I think to myself
you say ok and tell me you’re here if I need to talk
yeah right that is what she said when I wouldn't tell her
but when I told her she freaked and I lost her
the only person I trusted
now  I think to myself
'I can always come and talk to you'
yeah right
so you can leave me to
I start to think what is the truth?
well first off I know I; m not ok
I’m suffering
I’m stressed
I’m depressed
I’m suicidal
I feel alone
there is a nice short summary
I’m in pain everyday
and I’m so confused"
679,Emotion,TruthPoemsDoYouKnowTheTruthPoembyBobGotti,"Know the Truth, it will set you free, Christ is that Truth, and It is He.
To know the Truth is personally, do you know The God of Eternity?
The real truth is more than fact; it is Our Lord, who is coming back.
Today are you free in The Truth, or will you see His strong reproof?
This Truth that you come to know, goes with you wherever you go.
Will you have Truth by your side, the very day after you have died?
And this Truth that sets men free, also helps the blind men to see.
Did you receive the sight to see, the only Truth that rules Eternity?
When you see The Eternal Truth, you will be Christ’s living proof,
That God truly sets men free, as a changed man is what men see.
They’re freed from a darkened past, given a freedom that will last.
Freedom offered to both you and me, in Christ through all Eternity.
Christ is the only Truth you need, in this life to be set free indeed.
Do you have this freedom friend, that in Christ Jesus will not end?
His freedom always brings peace, even as other freedoms cease.
Will all your earthly freedom end, when you see our Savior friend?
God’s plans never fail my friend, as Satan learned way back when.
Are you still under Satan’s guise, or has Christ opened your eyes?
God sent the Savior Jesus Christ, as the freedom men need in life,
Will you embrace The Truth and be, free in Christ for all of Eternity?

680,Emotion,TruthPoemsTheTruthAboutHhoracePoembyEugeneField,"It is very aggravating
To hear the solemn prating
Of the fossils who are stating
That old Horace was a prude;
When we know that with the ladies
He was always raising Hades,
And with many an escapade his
Best productions are imbued.
There's really not much harm in a
Large number of his carmina,
But these people find alarm in a
Few records of his acts;
So they'd squelch the muse caloric,
And to students sophomoric
They d present as metaphoric
What old Horace meant for facts.
We have always thought 'em lazy;
Now we adjudge 'em crazy!
Why, Horace was a daisy
That was very much alive!
And the wisest of us know him
As his Lydia verses show him,--
Go, read that virile poem,--
It is No. 25.
He was a very owl, sir,
And starting out to prowl, sir,
You bet he made Rome howl, sir,
Until he filled his date;
With a massic-laden ditty
And a classic maiden pretty
He painted up the city,
And Maecenas paid the freight!"

For like a child that some fair book doth find,
With gilded leaves or colored vellum plays,
Or at the most on some find picture stays,
But never heeds the fruit of writer's mind:
So when thou saw'st in Nature's cabinet
Stella, thou straight lookst babies in her eyes,
In her cheek's pit thou didst thy pitfall set:
And in her breast bopeep or couching lies,
Playing and shining in each outward part:
But, fool, seekst not to get into her heart."

684,Emotion,TruthPoems0023TheTruthAboutTruthEtcPoembyMichaelShepherd,"Suppose the Greeks were right –
that, though some of us
may seek to climb Olympus
(the rocky scramble exhilarating
in the moist fresh morning,
the scent of coffee, baking bread,
rising from the valley below,
the occasional shout of shepherd to his dog,
up higher, the tiptilt goats surprised,
and then the mist, the thinning air,
the inner urge, ambition
fading, as humility, surrender, grow)
that all of us, fully although seemingly  in some degree,
yearn for the True, the Good, the Beautiful,
perhaps not in that order, or at least at first,
and believing or not believing
that ultimately, we may know the state
when in their glory, all these three
might merge, be indistinguishable;
for this, no climb is needed, since
the gods - the Greeks were sure of this -
dwell ever in our hearts; at rest, but
waiting for their call, or ours,
to show us to ourselves, and bursting forth
in what we recognise as enthusiasm..
but for those who love to climb,
who love the view, the upper air,
the risk, the challenge and the sport -
the topmost crags surmounted,
the scree no longer playing its game
of snakes and ladders with our feet and  hearts and minds,
the clouds like a white, concealing mystery,
now below us; the gods invisible to ground level eyes
run eagerly to greet us in our hearts; we now
pure oxygen for the others still visible
through  breaks in the white clouds of poetry,
climbing on their way; our hearts breathing pure oxygen for them
saying yes the climb is worth it,
the Greeks were right."

refusing the stiff procession to the grave,
letting the dead ride alone in the hearse.
It is June.  I am tired of being brave.
We drive to the Cape.  I cultivate
myself where the sun gutters from the sky,
where the sea swings in like an iron gate
and we touch.  In another country people die.
My darling, the wind falls in like stones
from the whitehearted water and when we touch
we enter touch entirely.  No one's alone.
Men kill for this, or for as much.
And what of the dead?  They lie without shoes
in the stone boats.  They are more like stone
than the sea would be if it stopped.  They refuse
to be blessed, throat, eye and knucklebone."

yourself, to imagine –
this dream; dream
this imaging:
the water’s so far, far below
it’s beyond this dark imagining, this dream;
all your attention is required
by this rope bridge,
swayed by nature to some immediate, vibrating laws
of this way, that way, more complex
than steel or concrete bear in mind –
five lines of rope, that’s all,
bound from time to time
but only every few and fearful steps
so that they do not part
unless you tread without remembering
all five of them; toe, heel, as you place your foot…
and now it seems, in the illogical
precision of this dream – which is in
league with some dark inner truth
and so, it must be walked – now,
it’s not five ropes, any more,
but five strings of some instrument
vibrating, low and high; while tense, taut mind
looks for firm frets to tune each step;
or can you trust their tuning?
is the tuning now the fingers of your feet?
each fallible or faulty foothold
will send its string’s own warning of uncertainty:
this bass string, booming failure between the valley’s two high cliffs;
this treble string, nerve-searing scream of pain;
ahead, this firm support that holds the strings, now
drops away; the hollow soundbox that’s all space,
all sound, all air, all touch and light and flow of sound;
the sound of judgment’s stern and justly-tempered final chord –
now you awake: relieved, yet with a question,
born of night, to be resolved by day;
what does the dream tell to the waking thought?
what does the waking thought tell of the dream?
some metaphor for life inhabited your dream;
some knowledge passed, wrapped in a metaphor;
you only know, that it was watched – by whom?"

And how my clothes always stunk
I’m sorry for not believing in you
I’m sorry that we never talked
It seemed as if we were just a couple of strangers wouldn’t you say?
I’m sorry for being hard on you even when you had a bad day
I’m sorry for never trying

The world still in motion.
People walking, but I’m the only one who has stopped.
I see me and I feel discussed.
I’m not what people want,
I’m as if handicapped, helpless.
I cry yet no one seems to care,
I try to fit in the worlds puzzle, but I seem too different to fit.
I look deep inside myself and there is pain,
New and old still there growing,
Yet no one sees that part of my fairly tale life.
I want the life that these so called humans have,
But they just won’t allow me as myself.
I want to just jump out of this ugly body of mine,
And stop my pretend life and live my true soul.
Till I start moving in motion with the world,
I will curl up as I am now,
Separated."

This side of the truth,
You may not see, my son,
King of your blue eyes
In the blinding country of youth,
That all is undone,
Under the unminding skies,
Of innocence and guilt
Before you move to make
One gesture of the heart or head,
Is gathered and spilt
Into the winding dark
Like the dust of the dead.
Good and bad, two ways
Of moving about your death
By the grinding sea,
King of your heart in the blind days,
Blow away like breath,
Go crying through you and me
And the souls of all men
Into the innocent
Dark, and the guilty dark, and good
Death, and bad death, and then
In the last element
Fly like the stars' blood
Like the sun's tears,
Like the moon's seed, rubbish
And fire, the flying rant
Of the sky, king of your six years.
And the wicked wish,
Down the beginning of plants
And animals and birds,
Water and Light, the earth and sky,
Is cast before you move,
And all your deeds and words,
Each truth, each lie,
Die in unjudging love."

Truth! If you are Joseph's beloved I shall love dreaming you.
Truth! If you are love I am ready to die being insane for you,
Truth! I promise I shall not held you responsible for my death.
Truth! If you are a reality why you appear as a superstition?
Truth! Though I am your image but I shall not hide myself behind the screens of lies."
693,Emotion,JusticePoemsJusticeIsDelayedPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"Laws are after all laws
With lot many lacuna and flaws
As counter system works
It is battle with clever words
“We, in the name of lord” lawyers argue
The accused stand silently in queue
The battle is fought without army
The client is in hurry and unhappy
No poor can afford such battle
He has no guts to carry on struggle
So they avoid such wrangle
It is as good as adding to more troubles
We hear conflicting reports in public
“The justice is sold” says alcoholic
No one believes his words
We have to wait only and look forwards
The cases are dragged on for years
This creates lots of agony and fear
Whole is life is spent in waiting
You get extension with more dating
Drug carriers and mafias invite
Most of the time to fight
Politicians carry importance
Their cases are heard at once
“Justice delayed is justice denied”
The sentence is alright but hopes are bellied
Justice if for rich and for those who can afford
You just take oath to speak right word"
694,Emotion,JusticePoemsRageForJusticePoembyDavidHarris,"Sometimes we seethe with rage
over some heinous crime committed.
Our voices are raised with thousands of others
for justice to prevail, and then watch in disbelief
as a nominal sentence is incurred.
Although the courts think,
they decide the fate of the individual
it is inside the walls of prison
that really seals their fate.
Sex offenders and child abusers
are never welcome there.
The prisoners welter out
their own brand of punishment for them.

695,Emotion,JusticePoemsJusticeForAllStorypoemPoembyivororivorehogg,"The bards of old their stories told.
In rhyming verse they had writ,
to entertain the young and old.
Sometimes they stretched the truth a bit.
To please their current lordly host
They would extol his bravery
and of his prowess loudly boast.
Although their words lacked verity.
They spread the news from far and near.
Tailored to suit their audience.
Some news which they were glad to hear.
The bards received in recompense.
The recognition and respect
accorded to them for their skill.
A place to sleep as you’d expect
and food and drink enough to fill.
Always treated as a welcome guest
in manor house or lordly hall
They could fulfil their host’s requests
with stories suitable for all.
Love stories for the ladies ears
and  tales of war to suit the men
Old tales for those advanced in years
which could recall their youth again.
The bards were guardians of the lore
which was passed down from bard to bard.
The masters of bryhonic law
Which they had studied long and hard.
It took them one and twenty years
to earn the title of a bard.
Long years of travel sweat and tears.
Authority was their reward.
All men were subject to the law
from kitchen churl to lordly knight
All disputes then were brought before
a bard to judge as was their right.
He listened to the evidence
then made his judgement openly
Applied the law with common sense
but always judged impartially.
But that was then unlike today.
When every man obeyed the law.
But sadly we have gone astray
There is no justice any more.
The laws today are not applied
to rich and poor men equally.
All thoughts of justice cast
aside in our corrupt society.
A guilty man can go Scott free
when clever lawyers twist the laws
and find some technicality.
For which they are well paid of course.
There are no bryhon bards today
and poets get but scant respect
But still we try to show the way
We must protest poetically.
The conscience of society
that has to be our modern role.
To outline with our poetry
Justice for all should be our goal.

696,Emotion,JusticePoemsHymneALaJusticePoembyAndreMariedeChenier,"A LA FRANCE
France! ô belle contrée, ô terre généreuse,
Que les dieux complaisants formaient pour être heureuse,
Tu ne sens point du nord les glaçantes horreurs,
Le midi de ses feux t'épargne les fureurs.
Tes arbres innocents n'ont point d'ombres mortelles;
Ni des poisons épars dans tes herbes nouvelles
Ne trompent une main crédule; ni tes bois
Des tigres frémissants ne redoutent la voix;
Ni les vastes serpents ne traînent sur tes plantes
En longs cercles hideux leurs écailles sonnantes.
Les chênes, les sapins et les ormes épais
En utiles rameaux ombragent tes sommets,
Et de Beaune et d'Aï les rives fortunées,
Et la riche Aquitaine, et les hauts Pyrénées,
Sous leurs bruyants pressoirs font couler en ruisseaux
Des vins délicieux mûris sur leurs coteaux.
La Provence odorante et de Zéphire aimée
Respire sur les mers une haleine embaumée,
Au bord des flots couvrant, délicieux trésor,
L'orange et le citron de leur tunique d'or,
Et plus loin, au penchant des collines pierreuses,
Forme la grasse olive aux liqueurs savoureuses,
Et ces réseaux légers, diaphanes habits,
Où la fraîche grenade enferme ses rubis.
Sur tes rochers touffus la chèvre se hérisse,
Tes prés enflent de lait la féconde génisse,
Et tu vois tes brebis, sur le jeune gazon,
Épaissir le tissu de leur blanche toison.
Dans les fertiles champs voisins de la Touraine,
Dans ceux où l'Océan boit l'urne de la Seine,
S'élèvent pour le frein des coursiers belliqueux.
Ajoutez cet amas de fleuves tortueux:
L'indomptable Garonne aux vagues insensées,
Le Rhône impétueux, fils des Alpes glacées,
La Seine au flot royal, la Loire dans son sein
Incertaine, et la Saône, et mille autres enfin
Qui, nourrissant partout, sur tes nobles rivages,
Fleurs, moissons et vergers, et bois et pâturages,
Rampent au pied des murs d'opulentes cités
Sous les arches de pierre à grand bruit emportés.
Dirai-je ces travaux, source de l'abondance,
Ces ports où des deux mers l'active bienfaisance
Amène les tributs du rivage lointain
Que visite Phoebus le soir ou le matin?
Dirai-je ces canaux, ces montagnes percées,
De bassins en bassins ces ondes amassées
Pour joindre au pied des monts l'une et l'autre Téthys,
Et ces vastes chemins en tous lieux départis,
Où l'étranger, à l'aise achevant son voyage,
Pense au nom des Trudaine et bénit leur ouvrage?
Ton peuple industrieux est né pour les combats.
Le glaive, le mousquet n'accablent point ses bras.
Il s'élance aux assauts, et son fer intrépide
Chassa l'impie Anglais, usurpateur avide.
Le ciel les fit humains, hospitaliers et bons,
Amis des doux plaisirs, des festins, des chansons;
Mais, faibles, opprimés, la tristesse inquiète
Glace ces chants joyeux sur leur bouche muette,
Pour les jeux, pour la danse appesantit leurs pas,
Renverse devant eux les tables des repas,
Flétrit de longs soucis, empreinte douloureuse,
Et leur front et leur âme. O France! trop heureuse
Si tu voyais tes biens, si tu profitais mieux
Des dons que tu reçus de la bonté des cieux!
Vois le superbe Anglais, l'Anglais dont le courage
Ne s'est sentais qu'aux lois d'un sénat libre et sage,
Qui t'épie, et, dans l'Inde éclipsant ta splendeur,
Sur tes fautes sans nombre élève sa grandeur.
Il triomphe, il t'insulte. Oh! combien tes collines
Tressailliraient de voir réparer tes ruines,
Et pour la liberté donneraient sans regrets
Et leur vin, et leur huile, et leurs belles forêts!
J'ai vu dans tes hameaux la plaintive misère,
La mendicité blême et la douleur amère.
Je t'ai vu dans tes biens, indigent laboureur,
D'un fisc avare et dur maudissant la rigueur,
Versant aux pieds des grands des larmes inutiles,
Tout trempé de sueurs pour toi-même infertiles,
Découragé de vivre, et plein d'un juste effroi
De mettre au jour des fils malheureux comme toi.
Tu vois sous les soldats les villes gémissantes;
Corvée, impôts rongeurs, tributs, taxes pesantes,
Le sel, fils de la terre, ou même l'eau des mers,
Sources d'oppression et de fléaux divers;
Mille brigands, couverts du nom sacré du prince,
S'unir à déchirer une triste province,
Et courir à l'envi, de son sang altérés,
Se partager entre eux ses membres déchirés!
O sainte Égalité! dissipe nos ténèbres,
Renverse les verrous, les bastilles funèbres.
Le riche indifférent, dans un char promené,
De ces gouffres secrets partout environné,
Rit avec les bourreaux, s'il n'est bourreau lui-même,
Près de ces noirs réduits de la misère extrême,
D'une maîtresse impure achète les transports,
Chante sur des tombeaux, et boit parmi des morts.
Malesherbes, Turgot, ô vous en qui la France
Vit luire, hélas! en vain, sa dernière espérance;
Ministres dont le coeur a connu la pitié,
Ministres dont le nom ne s'est point oublié,
Ah! si de telles mains, justement souveraines,
Toujours de cet empire avaient tenu les rênes!
L'équité clairvoyante aurait régné sur nous;
Le faible aurait osé respirer près de vous;
L'oppresseur, évitant d'armer d'injustes plaintes,
Sinon quelque pudeur, aurait ou quelques craintes;
Le délateur impie, opprimé par la faim,
Serait mort dans l'opprobre, et tant d'hommes enfin,
A l'insu de nos lois, à l'insu, du vulgaire,
Foudroyés sons les coups d'un pouvoir arbitraire,
De cris non entendus, de funèbres sanglots,
Ne feraient point gémir les voûtes des cachots.
Non, je ne veux plus vivre en ce séjour servile!
J'irai, j'irai bien loin me chercher un asile,
Un asile à ma vie en son paisible cours,
Une tombe à ma cendre à la fin de mes jours,
Où d'un grand au coeur dur l'opulence homicide
Du sang d'un peuple entier ne sera point avide,
Et ne me dira point, avec un rire affreux,
Qu'ils se plaignent sans cesse et qu'ils sont trop heureux;
Où, loin des ravisseurs, la main cultivatrice
Recueille les dons d'une terre propice;
Où mon coeur, respirant sous un ciel étranger,
Ne verra plus des maux qu'il ne peut soulager;
Où mes yeux, éloignés des publiques misères,
Ne verront plus partout les larmes de mes frères,
Et la pâle indigence à la mourante voix,
Et les crimes puissants qui font trembler les lois.
Toi donc, Équité sainte, ô toi, vierge adorée,
De nos tristes climats pour longtemps ignorée,
Daigne du haut des cieux goûter le libre encens
D'une lyre au coeur chaste, aux transports innocents,
Qui ne saura jamais, par des voeux mercenaires,
Flatter, à prix d'argent, des faveurs arbitraires,
Mais qui rendra toujours, par amour et par choix,
Un noble et pur hommage aux appuis de tes lois.
De voeux pour les humains tous ses chants retentissent:
La vérité l'enflamme, et ses cordes frémissent
Quand l'air qui l'environne auprès d'elle a porté
Le doux nom des vertus et de la liberté."
697,Emotion,JusticePoemsJusticePoembyArchieGreenidge,"Justice, justice, justice!
Where art thou? ye Stewarth?
Justice is the very warmth of an inn,
When interred from the bitter slippery, frosty storm.
Justice is the norm.
It's illusive to the door, like a very fastened door,
Cannot be entrusted to flurry mind.
Justice must be mandated.
With justice the waves are calm,
There is never a harm.
No one needs justice until
They themselves are imprisoned.
Justice is not heresy,
It's the healing of the soul."
698,Emotion,JusticePoemsTruthAndJusticePartSixPoembyEricCockrell,"i'm not trying to make people angry
this morning... an intelligent person
know anger is but a symptom of the
disease...
i do state this firmly:
you are a human being.
i dont care about your skin color,
your religious views, whether
you're male or female...
whether you're gay or straight...
you deserve the right to be who
you are, to your own dignity,
to work, to be fed and sheltered,
to raise your families,
to believe in your dreams.
and all of the people around
this old world deserve the same...
you deserve to be free...
inequality, greed, and apathy
wont cut it.
the truth is, we're all human!
and this is the truth that sets us free!"

Is Better Than No Justice

Full Justice
Not Pull The Wool Justice
She’s Already Been Blindfolded Enough
We Accuse Justice
But To Lose Justice
Is To Unlock Chaos’ Cuffs
Justice …
Is Lustrous
In Pearls Of Conviction Displayed
Justice …
The Huntress
Were Wild-Wily-Wrongs Are Caged
A Cry For Justice
Is Why Justice’s
Scales-Weights Shouldn’t Be In Doubt
Legal Justice
Be Equal Justice
With Rules To Balance It Out
Honest Justice

And Even Quick Justice
Should Be A Standard, Silvered Process
Raw Justice
Shouldn’t Be Flawed Justice
But Free To All Everywhere
The Power Of Justice
Is That The Hour Of Justice
Doesn’t Run Out Of Time Anywhere
Men Must Court Justice
And Support Justice
To Qualify For Her ‘Your’ Honor
And Seek Justice
And Speak Justice
And Be A Worthy Defender Word-Warrior
Some Have Burned Justice
Some Have Spurned Justice
In The Lies That They Have Sworn
Some Have Raped Justice
Then Gaped At Justice
Laid Bare Like Loss Innocence In Porn
Oh Sweet Justice
Don’t Beat Justice
We Are In Races But We Shouldn’t Fight
Some System Of Justice
Has Idealism Of Justice
But The Whole World Needs To Get It Right …
Then True Justice
And Overdue Justice
Will Be The Law Of Every Land & Life
Without Justice
You Can Count Justice’s
Tears Rolling Down In Strife
The Hope Of Justice
And Scope Of Justice
Is That Justice Answers To GOD
The Mercy Of Justice
And Courtesy Of Justice
Will Be The Final Plea Bargain LORD …

700,Emotion,JusticePoemsSocialJusticeGirlPoembyJulieASmith,"She is passionate about
fairness and equality.
Justice is not just a store,
but rather a progressive and important social concept.
Rosa Parks and Mother Teresa
are role models who inspire her.
She likes how February is
Black History month
and March is
Women's History month,
but yet she still ponders
how women have only had
the right to vote
since 1920 in America.
Not even 100 years
have passed
and there has never been
a woman President.
She doubts some men
would ever vote
for a woman President
and that makes her sad.
She likes when women
do not hit the glass ceiling
and instead rise
to positions of leadership.
She thinks pay inequality
based on gender
is grossly unfair.
She ponders how can men still be
paid vastly more
for the exact same job as a woman
in a progressive society?
She is a social justice girl."
701,Emotion,JusticePoemsJusticeEqualityCompassionHumanPoembyEricCockrell,"i spit hammers and nails,
can taste bullets and swords.
my eyes are the bodies
of the innocent that lay dying.
my fingers touch the ribs
of small children starving.
my tongue's made of coal dust,
oil, and death by profit!
my ears hear the cry of freedom
from the cells of the oppressor.
my heart sleeps neath the bridge
with the homeless family at night.
my fists smash the lie and the liar both,
my arms carry the weight
of the working class's lives.
covered with the stink of poverty,
i shed the clothes of pretensions,
apathy, and human greed.
and my desire grows hard
when i see a better day...
my back bears the stripes
of man's mistakes and failures...
i cry justice, i am equality,
i breathe compassion, i am human!"
702,Emotion,JusticePoemsAShoutOutForJusticePoembyReginaldWalker,"The unfair injury burdened upon the shoulders of the African men and women.
The echoes of slavery constantly overshadows America’s path to the future.
Memories of yesterdays gone; times that we hope will never return again.
The cries from the hurt, forced, chained and scared treading waters to places untold.
Tossed up and down upon the waves in the belly of the smelly wooden beast,
Chained up together and stacked so tight, there is no more hope for a safe retreat.
Longing and hoping for just a few moments of quietness and rest to escape.
Quietly yearning for the days past before this humiliating enslavement of defeat.
The dreadful hours turn into days; then suddenly followed by weeks and months.
The stench of former kings and queens mingles with the rotten flesh of the dead.
The useless cargo is buried without ceremony into the darkness of the deep sea.
Days later, the wooden beast unloads its scared cargo and is paid for each live head.
The dark skinned children of Africa forced to survive upon a distant hateful land.
Slaves nightly beaten until just can not take any more so quickly submit instead.
Fed like hogs; treated worse than dogs, force to sleep with the master or the wife.
If not obedient, the slave might be starved, beaten or have a bullet put in the head.
Oh, the scars run so deep through many descendants of the former kings and queens.
Forced to survive and fend for themselves; their forced servitude no longer is needed.
Required to hide in the dark backwoods of society like a secret no one wanted to be told.
Bowing and scraping just so Mr. Johnnie will feel good and hoping not to be mistreated.
Life off the plantation, faced with the promises of reconciliation never to be delivered.
It was just a lie to make them feel good about their wrongs committed to the African.
Promises made were quickly broken and any hope for equality was chased quickly away.
The seeds of the American slave should not speak up for fear of the dread white man’s hand.
Time progressed as the dreaded years turned into frightening decades of a different century.
Multitudes died as racist countrymen hunted them down just because they wanted the right to vote.
Politicians and preachers stood idle while the children of African-American slaves were hunted down.
Some were brave enough to speak the truth; he got shot and she ended up dangling from the end of a rope.
Decades later, things misleadingly seem to have changed a little except the plantation has gotten bigger.
No longer shipped over on the wooden beast; can forget freezing inside the plantation cold, battered shed.
Life has become more complicated, the necessity has now made every American an unwilling slave.
Working hard hoping to make the American dream come true then the job relocates oversees instead.
Today, no work, crime is rising and no one is living well on the great American corporate plantation.
The greed of the masters overshadows the prosperity dreamed of as new slaves willingly came ashore.
To be ground like meat for sausage some sold their very soul on the auction block of aspiration.
Only to sadly realize they are really slaves when instead of losing profit, they are often shown the door.
The unfair injury once burdened upon the shoulders of the African men and women.
The echoes of a slave's past rapidly overtakes America’s path to the unsure future.
Memories of yesterdays gone; prosperous times that we hope will somehow return again.
The past crimes done, now, cry out for justice because the need for reconciliation still exists."
703,Emotion,JusticePoemsJusticeWithNoLiePoembyDaveAlanWalker,"An innocent man
lies his head down to rest
not wanting to wake
to the morning sun
Instead wanting to wake
in a parallel universe
where truth and justice
is number one
In the real world
his days seem like years
they eat away at his
mind body and soul
If a witness would lie
he knows he might die
before truth and justice
Would see the light
but he's got to keep up the fight
All he wants
is justice with no lie
so come forward
and let truth and justice
shine it's light"

i am the minister
who joined the protest for peace,
dignity, and equality,
his face bashed in by the officer's club,
handcuffed in the back of the van...

for standing up for individual rights.

their future teetering...

705,Emotion,JusticePoemsJusticePoembyAmbroseBierce,"Jack Doe met Dick Roe, whose wife he loved,
And said: 'I will get the best of him.'
So pulling a knife from his boot, he shoved
It up to the hilt in the breast of him.
Then he moved that weapon forth and back,
Enlarging the hole he had made with it,
Till the smoking liver fell out, and Jack
Merrily, merrily played with it.
Then he reached within and he seized the slack
Of the lesser bowel, and, traveling
Hither and thither, looked idly back
On that small intestine, raveling.
The wretched Richard, with many a grin
Laid on with exceeding suavity,
Curled up and died, and they ran John in
And charged him with sins of gravity.
The case was tried and a verdict found:
The jury, with great humanity,
Acquitted the prisoner on the ground
Of extemporary insanity."

707,Emotion,JusticePoemsJusticePoembyPraveenKumarinUnknownHorizons,"Justice begotten in exchange is no justice,
For, exchange is trade,
A distressing gain through loss;
Justice is inherent right,
Though wrapped in black packs
In dark hall of race for survival
Like gold strains bound in mud
Till exploited;
She is cool like ice
And still like rock;
No easy road to charm her soul
While hardship makes her no more justice.
She, in inaccessible moon,
She, in inaccessible moon,
She, in inaccessible moon,
A charming dream of undying hopes.
She appears by disappearance
And cracks confidence;
You feel her flight outward
While strange shadows dull your Self;
You cannot catch her back,
You cannot catch her back,
For, in outward flight, she sinks to darkness
Where eyes blind
And distance rises;
Your hands, raised for justice,
Grope in hopeless void till strain
And give up unending fight forever
As dreams never win realities of deceits;
You see her in shades
In gloom's dark sea;
She surfaces from night's unending darkness
Like hopeless inaccessible mirage
In your eyes
While the world sees there plain darkness;
She is unseen to all
She is unseen to all, but,
You, who lost her out;
Men seek justice
In passion's thousand hues,
As she is invisible otherwise;
Aye, justice hides from justice
And breeds injustice.
Why justice is shackled to greed and bribe?
Why justice is fished out from popular mood?
Lost in thick jungle of lightless night,
Like rat, caught in the sack of death,
Like deer, caught in lion's lair,
She never reaches Self by herself.
Justice is the just haunt of nature's all games
What man for his crave molests and tames.
Justice must be just for all to see
In glow of crystal brightness
And impose herself in natural ease
Like flood seizes low-lying lands
And fill all pits of man's callousness;
It is justice of course,
It is justice in natural haunt,
That none gain by trade
Nor lose ever.
For, justice that limps in darkness is justice dead,
A corps you can never infuse life with.
Alas, justice lives feeble life
And yields to injustice in comfort;
It haunts as ghost after death
As if seeking rebirth
To live again weightless life
With no passion for just path,
Nor for anything just and fair.
Justice with no heart for truth,
Justice with no dash for right cause
Is justice dead indeed."
708,Emotion,JusticePoemsJusticeOrPeacePoembySossiKhachadourian,"How can be  a difference between peace and justice
I never knew there could be a difference
Among these  two essential points for survival our world's
I always thought they complete each other
Humanity's world has got destroyed
How can the world bear all these woes
But if ill be asked to choose among those
Justice or the peace
I would choose the peace
Because without peace lives stop surviving
As well as the world
But what's the meaning of justice
It's the difference among our thoughts
Thoughts if neglected lives will be survived
But when the peace deserts our lives
No one will stay alive
So for what is your justice when it will take lives"
709,Emotion,JusticePoemsJusticePart1PoembyDaveAlanWalker,"It was
Just another day
Or so I thought
But madness
Had got me
I didn't even know
I was walking
Through the city
Minding my own
When I saw a man
Hurt someone
I should have known
I should have turned away
I should have gone another way
But my mind
Wouldn't let me
It was too far away
I'm chasing
I'm chasing
I'm gaining
But I'm losing
I'm fighting
But I'm not moving
I'm chasing
My dreams away
I catch him
I beat him
I take the blame for him
Then I pay
For what he done
Twenty years of pain
Justice never done"

Her bandage hides two festering sores

711,Emotion,JusticePoemsJusticePoembyGavinButtar,"Justice is revenge for those who have suffered loses,
And for others it’s a punishment
It involves the truth, not the lies
If you want Justice you must be able to stand up for the truth.
It is not just going to come and knock on your door
You must be able to listen to the truth
What is justice really?
Is it truth, or revenge?
What is truth?
What is revenge?"

If you're hellbent on dark intrigue!
Don't seek to harm, to kill or maim!
Don't think that you'll escape the blame!
They'll hunt you down by night and day!
They'll turn the tables! You're their prey!
They'll not give in like others do!
They'll cross the Cosmos just for you!
No secret hideout stops their quest!
They'll persevere! They'll do their best!
They'll scan, they'll plan, they'll wear you down!
They'll make you fret and fear and frown!
They'll use brute force! They'll fight to win!
They'll brave all odds to conquer sin!
You'll rue the day crime came to tempt!
They'll give you nightmares yet undreamt!
They'll chase you here, they'll chase you there!
They'll chase you, land, or sea, or air!
They'll make you sick! You'll spit and curse!
For you, there's no safe universe!
There's nothing that defeats their power!
They'll make you cringe and crawl and cower!
So don't be foolish! Don't be brave!

They are giving their lives for you and for me,
On land, in the air, and out on the sea.
They are brave and strong, and have faith in God.
And are fighting for the land their forefathers trod.
If they can fight for justice and peace.
Let's not let our efforts cease. Let us back home, toil-from light to dark
So our boys, can hit their mark,
This justice and peace, although it is old,
Is a tale that years and centuries unfold.
Our country was founded upon this claim,
And it's our privilege to keep it the same.
This was and conflict, I know will soon end.
For justice and peace; to God are akin."
716,Emotion,JusticePoemsPersonalJusticePoembyCristinaGeanta,"i have my personal justice written across my pulse
constant thoughts and very clear needs
my personal justice is just that: personal
like a thief whose money you're carrying
that's me..
if only luck didn't have so much to do with it
or time, or life
who says i'm not better?
life has its own will and it does not care about your plans
or secrets or hopes you bury inside.. counting minutes, days, months
for your justice to have its turn
it does not have a turn
time couldn't care less
you can be your own prisonner, if you like
life won't even bother
still... when will you surrender?"

718,Emotion,JusticePoemsGeorgeZimmermanNotGuiltyATravestyOfJusticePoembyLukeEaster,"What happened to Trayvon Martin shouldn’t happen to any 1,
And yet, this killing is not the worse thing that has been done,
Weekend before George Zimmerman’s not guilty of any & all,
51 Black on Black gunshots 40 wounded 11 would fatally fall.
City of Chicago, where Blacks kill more Blacks, George who?
Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton don’t they have enough to do?
Rainbow Coalition & Operation P.U.S.H. is the head quarters,
Hey Reverend Jackson first clean up within your own borders.
This tragedy is being protested by thousands of American Blacks,
With not one single rally regarding those deadly Chicago attacks,
Detroit, South Central, Philly, Harlem, Houston, Gary & Buffalo,
The tip of the Iceberg for the killing of Blacks if you didn’t know.
Trayvon is one, in the above cities hundreds may die every week,
For a single case the DOJ is asked to investigate, truth we seek?
Truth is, Black on Black murders should be a more heinous crime,
Is it so commonplace that Blacks expect it as it’s done all the time?
Rap videos depict violence common as Chevrolet & Mom’s apple pie?
Inner city neighborhoods you’re not expected to graduate but to die?
Oh, Carl and Louis Stokes, Lawyers, Mayor, Congress, Judge but who?
Instead strive to be drug dealers, pimps, rappers, instead of you two?
DOJ investigates anything it should re-open the case of LaVena Lynn,
Think Trayvon was an atrocity? Read what happened to PFC Johnson,
Find it then forward the information to Obama, he’s had nothing to say,
Because he’s too busy making personal phone calls congratulating Gays."

Then they go and lie
Put people in prison

Why would they lie
Is it in their mind
How can they live
knowing this
Has their soul

Will it eat them away
until one day they will have to say
what they saw that day
Maybe they are traumatized
by dismay
But it doesn't mean
they have to put innocent people away
The lies must stop
Why should the guilty get away
While innocent people
rot away"

only the fool hearted,
will contemplate pursuing even the most just of causes,
when justice stands still,
the brave only will seek retribution
for sins committed against them and their kinsman,
can any gleamse of sovereignty  exist
where justice takes a tea break,
and when justice decides to stand still
will any sanity prevail,
where justice once stood still,
can any unity ever be restored
once upon a time the jews were slandered and abused
but they had the courage to stand up and refuse,
when justice stands still,
the supposed saviours become the enslavers,
who then will stand up to refuse for the people
when justice stands still,
the law makers become peace detractors,
creating laws meant not to ensure harmony,
but to bring woo to the masses,
when justice stands still,
they will seek to devour,
those they once vowed to protect,
justice stands still,

A person was born
After lots of stories and the morbid things,
He decided to sing,
To sing a song of a dirty world,
A world full of lies and fake words
A world of lust and stupid joys
A world that consist of different girls and boys
A world of nags and nasty actions to some of us
A world that nothing inside it is true bust loss
A world that we live in
A world that lives with no mean
A world for rich guys with their colorful cars
A world of giant wars
A world full of words, full of verses, full of hope
Where young saint children have no hope
There is no world for those children that I saw
I hate those fake words and speeches about the laws
Look around please. Think a little. What do we miss? !
For sure lots of things. And one of them is justice!
Justice of those old times I think you know,
Justice that a man done, and what about now?
How can all the cruelties happen in a world?
How a human can breaks the rules in a world?
How can we make the wrong decisions about our dears in a world?
How can we forget the justice, how do we forget the justice in a world?

728,Emotion,JusticePoems0311EternalJusticePoembyMichaelShepherd,"I was just staggering in the gate
with two heavy bags
from an exhausting week’s conference
when the conman and his accomplice
got me right at my own front door –
I’m mortified by the memory –
they could replace my missing roof tiles
in a moment, look, the ladder’s
already up there, the accomplice
is halfway up, now he’s already
on the roof in his plimsolls, now he's
shaking the chimney-stack, look, it's loose
.... no cash? oh,
they’d drive me to the nearest cash-point…
well, you can guess the rest –
anything for a quiet life…
as I dozed off that evening,
flushed with anger, blushed with stupidity,
too tired to crawl to bed,
realizing that conmen have
all the skills of hypnotists,
enlightenment struck:
the next morning, I would wake up
150 dollars the poorer but morning-fresh;
‘they’ would wake up with the urgent need
to seek another mug each day.
And I realised that sublime, ruthless,
beautiful, tragic, comic, eternal justice
is - to be – to live it through  as -
just as we are; right now…

729,Emotion,JusticePoemsAKillerWantsJusticePoembyHerbertNehrlich,"My aunt was old and very weak
but rich up to her ears.
She had much gold and silver, too
and therefore many fears.
One night I snuck up in her house,
I'd made a special key.
I was as quiet as a mouse,
and she did not hear me.
I carried a knife, an eighteen incher
and was about to thrust it down,
when Max, that awful Scottish pincher
began to bark and growl and frown.
I killed them both in expert manner,
the knife with both hands (for extra strength) .
I wasn't sure about how deep,
that's why I slid them width and length.
When all was quiet  save my teeth
I dragged them down toward the cellar.
And dug one hole to put them in
and said 'good work there, feller'.
The gold and silver and the money
where heavy but I took it all.
And then I thought it might be funny
to give the cops a little call.
A handkerchief on the receiver,
I spoke with accent and quite loud
to the confused 'not-quite-believer'.
I told him what it was about.
And finally, before good bye
I couldn't help myself to yell
that he should look now for the guy.
That's why I'm sitting  in a cell.
My aunt was old and very weak
and rich up to her ears.
Now you, the jury, all you seek
is truth you know no fears.
You want my life but I am young,
and I was poor, you know.
Of all the laws you look among
find one and let me go!

730,Emotion,JusticePoemsTheHallOfJusticePoembyGeorgeCrabbe,"Part I
VAGRANT.
Take, take away thy barbarous hand,
And let me to thy Master speak;
Remit awhile the harsh command,
And hear me, or my heart will break.
MAGISTRATE.
Fond wretch! and what canst thou relate,
But deeds of sorrow, shame, and sin?
Thy crime is proved, thou know'st thy fate;
But come, thy tale!--begin, begin! -
VAGRANT.
My crime!--This sick'ning child to feed.
I seized the food, your witness saw;
I knew your laws forbade the deed,
But yielded to a stronger law.
Know'st thou, to Nature's great command
All human laws are frail and weak?
Nay! frown not--stay his eager hand,
And hear me, or my heart will break.
In this, th' adopted babe I hold
With anxious fondness to my breast,
My heart's sole comfort I behold,
More dear than life, when life was blest;
I saw her pining, fainting, cold,
I begg'd--but vain was my request.
I saw the tempting food, and seized -
My infant-sufferer found relief;
And in the pilfer'd treasure pleased,
Smiled on my guilt, and hush'd my grief.
But I have griefs of other kind,
Troubles and sorrows more severe;
Give me to ease my tortured mind,
Lend to my woes a patient ear;
And let me--if I may not find
A friend to help--find one to hear.
Yet nameless let me plead--my name
Would only wake the cry of scorn;
A child of sin, conceived in shame,
Brought forth in woe, to misery born.
My mother dead, my father lost,
I wander'd with a vagrant crew;
A common care, a common cost;
Their sorrows and their sins I knew;
With them, by want on error forced,
Like them, I base and guilty grew.
Few are my years, not so my crimes;
The age which these sad looks declare,
Is Sorrow's work, it is not Time's,
And I am old in shame and care.
Taught to believe the world a place
Where every stranger was a foe,
Train'd in the arts that mark our race,
To what new people could I go?
Could I a better life embrace,
Or live as virtue dictates? No! -
So through the land I wandering went,
And little found of grief or joy;
But lost my bosom's sweet content
When first I loved the Gipsy-Boy.
A sturdy youth he was and tall,
His looks would all his soul declare;
His piercing eyes were deep and small,
And strongly curl'd his raven-hair.
Yes, AARON had each manly charm,
All in the May of youthful pride,
He scarcely fear'd his father's arm,
And every other arm defied. -
Oft, when they grew in anger warm,
(Whom will not love and power divide?)
I rose, their wrathful souls to calm,
Not yet in sinful combat tried.
His father was our party's chief,
And dark and dreadful was his look;
His presence fill'd my heart with grief,
Although to me he kindly spoke.
With Aaron I delighted went,
His favour was my bliss and pride;
In growing hope our days we spent,
Love's growing charms in either spied;
It saw them all which Nature lent,
It lent them all which she denied.
Could I the father's kindness prize,
Or grateful looks on him bestow,
Whom I beheld in wrath arise,
When Aaron sunk beneath his blow?
He drove him down with wicked hand,
It was a dreadful sight to see;
Then vex'd him, till he left the land,
And told his cruel love to me;
The clan were all at his command,
Whatever his command might be.
The night was dark, the lanes were deep,
And one by one they took their way;
He bade me lay me down and sleep,
I only wept and wish'd for day.
Accursed be the love he bore,
Accursed was the force he used,
So let him of his God implore
For mercy, and be so refused!
You frown again,--to show my wrong
Can I in gentle language speak?
My woes are deep, my words are strong, -
And hear me, or my heart will break.
MAGISTRATE.
I hear thy words, I feel thy pain;
Forbear awhile to speak thy woes;
Receive our aid, and then again
The story of thy life disclose.
For, though seduced and led astray,
Thou'st travell'd far and wander'd long;
Thy God hath seen thee all the way,
And all the turns that led thee wrong.
Part II
MAGISTRATE.
Come, now again thy woes impart,
Tell all thy sorrows, all thy sin;
We cannot heal the throbbing heart
Till we discern the wounds within.
Compunction weeps our guilt away,
The sinner's safety is his pain;
Such pangs for our offences pay,
And these severer griefs are gain.
VAGRANT.
The son came back--he found us wed,
Then dreadful was the oath he swore;
His way through Blackburn Forest led, -
His father we beheld no more.
Of all our daring clan not one
Would on the doubtful subject dwell;
For all esteem'd the injured son,
And fear'd the tale which he could tell.
But I had mightier cause for fear,
For slow and mournful round my bed
I saw a dreadful form appear, -
It came when I and Aaron wed.
Yes! we were wed, I know my crime, -
We slept beneath the elmin tree;
But I was grieving all the time,
And Aaron frown'd my tears to see.
For he not yet had felt the pain
That rankles in a wounded breast;
He waked to sin, then slept again,
Forsook his God, yet took his rest.
But I was forced to feign delight,
And joy in mirth and music sought, -
And mem'ry now recalls the night,
With such surprise and horror fraught,
That reason felt a moment's flight,
And left a mind to madness wrought.
When waking, on my heaving breast
I felt a hand as cold as death:
A sudden fear my voice suppress'd,
A chilling terror stopp'd my breath.
I seem'd--no words can utter how!
For there my father-husband stood,
And thus he said: --'Will God allow,
The great Avenger just and Good,
A wife to break her marriage vow?
A son to shed his father's blood?'
I trembled at the dismal sounds,
But vainly strove a word to say;
So, pointing to his bleeding wounds,
The threat'ning spectre stalk'd away.
I brought a lovely daughter forth,
His father's child, in Aaron's bed;
He took her from me in his wrath,
'Where is my child?'--'Thy child is dead.'
'Twas false--we wander'd far and wide,
Through town and country, field and fen,
Till Aaron, fighting, fell and died,
And I became a wife again.
I then was young: --my husband sold
My fancied charms for wicked price;
He gave me oft for sinful gold,
The slave, but not the friend of vice: -
Behold me, Heaven! my pains behold,
And let them for my sins suffice.
The wretch who lent me thus for gain,
Despised me when my youth was fled;
Then came disease, and brought me pain: -
Come, Death, and bear me to the dead!
For though I grieve, my grief is vain,
And fruitless all the tears I shed.
True, I was not to virtue train'd,
Yet well I knew my deeds were ill;
By each offence my heart was pain'd
I wept, but I offended still;
My better thoughts my life disdain'd,
But yet the viler led my will.
My husband died, and now no more
My smile was sought, or ask'd my hand,
A widow'd vagrant, vile and poor,
Beneath a vagrant's vile command.
Ceaseless I roved the country round,
To win my bread by fraudful arts,
And long a poor subsistence found,
By spreading nets for simple hearts.
Though poor, and abject, and despised,
Their fortunes to the crowd I told;
I gave the young the love they prized,
And promised wealth to bless the old.
Schemes for the doubtful I devised,
And charms for the forsaken sold.
At length for arts like these confined
In prison with a lawless crew,
I soon perceived a kindred mind,
And there my long-lost daughter knew;
His father's child, whom Aaron gave
To wander with a distant clan,
The miseries of the world to brave,
And be the slave of vice and man.
She knew my name--we met in pain;
Our parting pangs can I express?
She sail'd a convict o'er the main,
And left an heir to her distress.
This is that heir to shame and pain,
For whom I only could descry
A world of trouble and disdain:
Yet, could I bear to see her die,
Or stretch her feeble hands in vain,
And, weeping, beg of me supply?
No! though the fate thy mother knew
Was shameful! shameful though thy race
Have wander'd all a lawless crew,
Outcasts despised in every place;
Yet as the dark and muddy tide,
When far from its polluted source,
Becomes more pure and purified,
Flows in a clear and happy course;
In thee, dear infant! so may end
Our shame, in thee our sorrows cease,
And thy pure course will then extend,
In floods of joy, o'er vales of peace.
Oh! by the GOD who loves to spare,
Deny me not the boon I crave;
Let this loved child your mercy share,
And let me find a peaceful grave:
Make her yet spotless soul your care,
And let my sins their portion have;
Her for a better fate prepare,
And punish whom 'twere sin to save!
MAGISTRATE.
Recall the word, renounce the thought,
Command thy heart and bend thy knee;
There is to all a pardon brought,
A ransom rich, assured and free;
'Tis full when found, 'tis found if sought,
Oh! seek it, till 'tis seal'd to thee.
VAGRANT.
But how my pardon shall I know?
MAGISTRATE.
By feeling dread that 'tis not sent,
By tears for sin that freely flow,
By grief, that all thy tears are spent,
By thoughts on that great debt we owe,
With all the mercy God has lent,
By suffering what thou canst not show,
Yet showing how thine heart is rent,
Till thou canst feel thy bosom glow,
And say, 'MY SAVIOUR, I REPENT!'"
731,Emotion,JusticePoemsTheCountryJusticePoembyJeanDeLaFontaine,"TWO lawyers to their cause so well adhered,
A country justice quite confused appeared,
By them the facts were rendered so obscure
With which the truth remained he was not sure.
At length, completely tired, two straws he sought
Of diff'rent lengths, and to the parties brought.
These in his hand he held:--the plaintiff drew
(So fate decreed) the shortest of the two.
On this the other homeward took his way,
To boast how nicely he had gained the day.
THE bench complained: the magistrate replied
Don't blame I pray--'tis nothing new I've tried;
Courts often judge at hazard in the law,
Without deciding by the longest straw."

Love too has fruit to bear
United must become all four
And practiced everywhere
True justice cannot stand alone
It needs of truth and peace
When love becomes the corner stone
Sweet fruit will never cease
Let's drink The Truth as sweet old wine
Let love live not in vane
Mix justice now with peace divine
Allow harmony reign
For justice without love is nought
Peace without truth’s a lie
Until the world this fact is taught
Condemned she’s bound to die
To facts of life she must be wise
Her children need to see
Until they look with open eyes
Salvation cannot be
When truth and peace they understand
When love becomes her root
When justice lifts her outstretched hand
She’ll bear the sweetest fruit
Let candour be a constant guide
Integrity wear a crown
Impartiality reign inside
With love as wedding gown
Allow love’s wisdom steadfast rule
Truth’s knowledge change one’s heart
Let peace become our daily tool
Let justice play her part"

736,Emotion,JusticePoemsFreedomJusticeAndEqualityPoembyLonnieHicks,"Freedom, Justice and Equality
sat down to discuss their differences
as to who in the final differentiation
was best for the Citizens.
Equality spoke stating 'Every human being
is to be seen as equal.
Classes, Kings, and Robber Barons
have mounted historically over-weening excesses.
From them sprung oppression, slavery,
disease and poverty
other multiple negatives
in the sad human panoply.
Society rebelled against them
all hoisting my banner
which reads:
'What We Need is Equality'
All agreed this was so
for a time
with Justice finally noting
'Well Equality all you say is true
but also mark
how easy it is to confuse Economic Opportunity
with Political Equality.
Some systems have one
but surely not the other.
These two, of course, are not the same;
in fact you Equality are perfectly
compatible with Perfect Slavery.
All you have to is treat
all the slaves the same!
'Besides' Justice said 'Economic Opportunity
merely addresses the beginning of the race.
What of the middle and the end;
is Perfect Inequality tolerated there
as millions sink into poverty? '
'No' Justice sighed, 'Equality you are a good plank
but you do not over-arc and don't really solve
important problems.
I, Justice, am needed to balance all the ills
you're not able to address.'
Justice shifted slightly in her dark robes
and spoke of that need to protect Citizens
utilizing legal and governing rules.
'Rule by law
not women or men is better
grafted to all systems:
Balancing and adjusting many of the
the ills Undemocracy brings.'
'Justice is centerpiece
where all the values of the citizens
are sifted and set aright-
enforcements of the Covenants.
It is I,
through which
all society is possible.'
Freedom spoke slowly
gathering verbal momentum:
'Justice you are mystical
but in the end precisely note that
laws are made by men and women
and is therefore rule by Judges.
This does not seem to me
to be much better than rule by Kings.'
'No mere Justice
does not work for me.
Clearly the object we all seek,
is Freedom- Me.
Justice merely refers to
misdeeds but not the essence
of what we seek.
That would be me Freedom.
For here is where all potential is protected,
the Cauldron of the Probabilities.
Freedom is what we fight for,
you, Justice, we merely sue for-
if we have the money
to pay your attorneys! '
Equality smiled wryly at Freedom's joke saying
'but you Freedom have many aliases
many definitions labeled;
which Freedom are you today:
Freedom From
or Freedom to
Free speech
or the Freedom of the Road
or merely Freedom From All Rules?
And I would note you proclaim
Liberty For All
while tolerating
Tyranny while at Work.
You Americans define Freedom
as Freedom for Yourself
what of Freedom for Others,
in fact, the Freedom of the World.
You fall silent there.'
Outside a crowd gathered,
Justice leaned to part the curtains,
describing the outside scene.
There was Ethics and Morality,
Nature
God and Divinity
the usual crowd all clamoring
to be heard
or to gain entry.
Freedom said
'they have right to their say.'
Equality mused 'they all make equal claims.'
Justice said 'if given the chance
like vigilante villagers
they'll be pounding closed-fisted
at every citizens door.'
They all agreed
and sipped their tea
until at the appointed hour
when key in lock
admitted the rightful owner of the house.
Citizens Us
was framed in the doorway Portal
with her constant companion Social Covenant;
They entered
with Citizen saying
'You get all three of you
if you chose Citizen Community
because there you get all of you
plus me."

That I swore ne'er to rest till I'd settled some plan
Whereby in the Lockup to cleverly cram him!
And so to my Super the matter I put,
Who thereupon 'found' a sheep's head near his hut,
And the 'how came it there?' was sufficient to damn him,
The Beak before who I then lugg'd him, as you
May suppose, being neck-deep in Squattery too.
'Twas a beautiful Hearing, as noted at large
By the Clerk (who was bonuss'd)-sheep-stealing the charge;
'Twould make your hearts laugh in the Records to see
How we bullied him out of his wits! -I say we,
Because while on this side against him 1 banged,
On the other the Beak said he ought to be hanged,
For a gallows-grained, scandalous son of transgression!
And committing him then-the case being so plain,
We sent him three hundred miles 'down on the chain'
To his Trial-and eke to his 'acquittal', at Session!
For what care we Squatters for Law on a push?
And for Justice! what has she to do with the Bush?"
740,Emotion,JusticePoemsApplyingForJusticePoembyMoutasemAlgharati,"This has something to do with whom it may concern
Dear all I know, ordinary and close, new or old
Because of you, is the answer of all what happen?
I am writing, in response of what inner voice told?
By knowing all, mind is shaped with unknown pieces of ice
As well as earth's, yet earth's has its own tourist guide
He, who shows directions, guides skiing after sunrise
For mine, default memory abroad navigates with a boat guy
Remember? The first sight lesson you taught me to judge!
Even unjust court listens to convicts, who grabbed living right
Jealous friends you were! Inspiring with fibs, but those large!
Though you are many, only very few fed my life with light
I am looking forward to hearing a persuasive reply soon
Yours sincerely, CC; My cynosure and loyal friend: moon"
741,Emotion,JusticePoemsJusticePoembykafiluddinraihan,"We can never create a single life,
So we shouldn't have right to take it,
But what is going on all around a society,
Some psychotic man have been serial killer,
Some are killing people for so called revenge,
Some are killing as a victim of a situation,
Intentionally and unintentionally we are killing,
Now any one can say that for this we have laws,
But what is our law doing in the sake of justice?
Hanging a person, or electrocuting him on a chair,
In the name of painless death injecting poisons,
But are not these the way of killing a person?
Are not these the excuses to hide our failures?
This is us, Who give birth these sick murderers,
This is us, who let a man to be a killer,
Whatever that is, so called legal or illegal,
Are not these both killing processes sin?
Are not these bot about taking a life?
Can we say this justice a justice,
Which allows to take a life empowering a badge?
Think man...Humanity is crying in the door of justice..."
742,Emotion,JusticePoemsJusticeOfTheExternalMindPoembyDaveAlanWalker,"Slaves to the powers
of the external mind
If your innocent or guilty
they do not mind
Watching and waiting
to make their strike
They'll take you down
and watch you drown
As long as they get somebody
to make themselves proud
They won't care
that your mind is not all there
All over the world
The powers of the external mind
is watching you"
743,Emotion,JusticePoemsIsItReallyJusticeOrJustRevengePoembyAmyFifita,"Is capital punishment justice or is it revenge?
This is the question that I want to defend.
Is it really justice if you have to kill someone?
Or is the killing of a being just for your fun?
Is a murder really justified if the culprit spends less time in jail?
If so then it seems capital punishment is just easy bail.
They should be punished and not given an out of jail card,
All capital punishment is doing is spending money, cold and hard.
Wanting them to die doesn’t seem like justice but revenge?
It leaves blood on your hands when there life ends.
Life is full of trials and tribulations this is a must,
But if you kill a man then it won’t make life any more just.
Justice is using authority to give a fair decree,
But intended death to a being doesn’t seem fair to me.
Revenge is to satisfy in retaliation,
But death’s your one hit wonder, one satisfaction.
So I will always choose the criminals to defend,
Leaving you with your decision: justice or revenge?"

Supreme Court
lacks creditable
determinable
unity of purpose.
Guantanamo Bay
is a geographical
miscarriage of justice.
Guantanamo Bay
sanctioned sanitized
political spin styled military;
‘is a detainment facility
of the United States
located in (Castro)   Cuba.’
The Boy Scouts
honour badges
ran summer camps
detainment areas
three Gitmo resorts
Camp Delta/ Echo
Camp Iguana but
Camp X-Ray was;
closed due to naughty
torture techniques
that’s human rights

ok boys and girls?
The Justice Department?
Said its ok because
Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp
is our sneaky hidy-hole
outside U.S. legal jurisdiction!
Fuhrer Reich
Chancellor Bush
declared detainees;
were not allowed
not allowed
any protections
under humane
Geneva Conventions!
January 11,2002
the first twenty
prisoners arrived
ghost prisoners
held in hall of shame.
June 29,2006
the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld;
prisoners are entitled

listed under
Common Article 3
Geneva Conventions.
July 7,2006
Department of Defense

are entitled to protection
under Common Article 3.
June,2008

for 120 days

to be shut down
within the year.
But oh dear
to date

President Barack Obama
Presidential Memorandum;
orders preparation of
Thomson Correctional Center
in Thomson Illinois
to prepare for transferred
Guantanamo prisoners.
The first ammendment
protects the rights

There is no greater
singular unity

than protecting
homeland security.
Three gangsters
international bully boys
Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld;

unique overwhelming
in untried innocence.
The Definitive List
The Guantánamo Files
history has proven to date;
‘at least 93 percent
of the 779 men and boys
imprisoned in total’
were completely
innocent people!
Or Taliban foot soldiers
fighting an internal
inter-Muslim civil war;
with no connection to
Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda
or international terrorism!
A war that started long
before the terrorist attacks
of September 11,2001.
Prisoners seized
as a result of
dubious intelligence;
or sold for
bounty payments!
The Motown

prisoners remained?
What future for the untried?
January 25,2010
Guantanamo Detainee
Review Task Force
is recommending...
nearly 50 detainees
be held indefinitely
without charge!
Washington Post claims
task force determined
Gitmo prisoners;
facing indefinite detention
are too dangerous
catch twenty-two
too dangerous
to be released;
not enough evidence
for a criminal trial.
Wow nine years on
the panel recommends
35 prisoners be brought;
to the U.S. to face military
or civilian fair trials!
Attorney General Eric Holder
‘decided five will be tried in
New York federal court;
for their alleged roles in
the 2001 terror attacks’!
Six to be tried by military commissions
Thomson Correctional Center
will likely house terrorism-era detainees!
Their crimes?
Allegedly spent time
at al Qaeda training;
camps in Afghanistan
prior to the 9/11 attacks!
Luckily being a marine
or a navy seal is not a crime
but linked to Taliban is!
Held without due process is legal?
In the Land of the Free
where imprisonment is double;
the next country at number two.
America has gotta be number one!
And our winners in our
State Lottery are Task Force (zap zap)
divided into three groups
‘35 who should be prosecuted  (fair trial?)
in federal or military courts’ (yea 9 years ago)
‘110 who can be released, (pardon the yawn)
either immediately or eventually’ (no hurry)
‘50 who must be detained without trial’
Apparently Gitmo detainees
‘perhaps others suspected
terrorists and war fighters
taken into U.S. custody
will now have a difficult
time challenging
their detention.’
No shit! Really?
‘Guantanamo Bay detainees
officially have limited rights in court
and presidential war powers to detain;
suspected terrorists trump the
international law of war.’
‘Officials said the detainees
cleared for release
will be repatriated or transferred to;
other countries for
possible release? ’
Is this the way we fight the war,
fight the war fight the war,
fight the war, on terrorism?
When you declare war
on words apparently it is
however it is not the way;
to win hearts and minds
to a just honourable cause!
Could it be said
the world’s policeman
has over stepped;
the boundary
of his jurisdiction?
That a few statutes
of liberty
have been transgressed?
Empire America
no longer fears
divine retribution;
God was outlawed
in public places!
Oh modern Babaylon
the Great, once so admired,
the eagle is falling;
the writing is on the wall
or on Wall Street?
Repent of your Hubris Oh America
‘M’ne! M’ne! T’kel ufarsin P’res’
‘ME’NE, ME’NE, TE’KEL, PAR’SIN’
This writing is not yet written on your wall!

747,Emotion,JusticePoemsModernJusticePoembyHerbertNehrlich,"A jury sat around a tree
to judge a man for treason.
The foreman said 'how can it be
this fellow had no reason.
A patriot who, for his land
stood deep in Flanders' trenches,
today is forced to take a stand
and face Justitia's benches.
Then tea was served and little snacks,
one of the jurors fainted,
she found it hard to just relax
when evidence was tainted.
They shot the fellow near the tree,
'twas sanctioned by the nation.
They had no proof that one could see,
did no investigation.
It often happens in this world
where imbeciles now rule,
and when their ugly lies are hurled
it's  you who   plays the fool.
They put you down, just like a dog
and laugh when you expire.
Then toast each other with their grog,
it's  JUSTICE  they admire.
The little word  INTEGRITY
has fallen out of favour.
The tea served underneath the tree
does have a modern flavour."

Yet I'm an honest wife.
To whom I'm wedded, ye ne'er shall be told,

749,Emotion,JusticePoemsEternalJusticePoembyCharlesMackay,"The man is thought a knave, or fool.
Or bigot, plotting crime,
Who, for the advancement of his kind.
Is wiser than his time.
For him the hemlock shall distil;
For him the axe be bared;
For him the gibbet shall be built;
For him the stake prepared.
Him shall the scorn and wrath of men
Pursue with deadly aim;
And malice, envy, spite, and lies,
ShaU desecrate his name.
But Truth shall conquer at the last.
For round and round we run;
And ever the Right comes uppermost,
And ever is Justice done.
Pace through thy cell, old Socrates,
Cheerily to and fro;
Trust to the impulse of thy soul,
And let the poison flow.
They may shatter to earth the lamp of clay
That holds a light divine,
But they cannot quench the fire of thought
By any such deadly wine.
They cannot blot thy spoken words
From the memory of man
By all the poison ever was brew'd
Since time its course began.
To-day abhorred, to-morrow adored,
So round and round we run;
And ever the Truth comes uppermost.
And ever is Justice done.
Plod in thy cave grey anchorite;
Be wiser than thy peers;
Augment the range of human power,
And trust to coming years.
They may call thee wizard, and monk accursed,
And load thee with dispraise;
Thou wert bom five hundred years too soon
For the comfort of thy days;
But not too soon for humankind.
Time hath reward in store;
And the demons of our sires become
The saints that we adore.
The blind can see, the slave is lord,
So round and round we run;
And ever the wrong is proved to be wrongs
And ever is Justice done.
Keep, Galileo, to thy thought,
And nerve thy soul to bear;
They may gloat o'er the senseless words they wring
From the pangs of thy despair;
They may veil their eyes, but they cannot hide
The sun's meridian glow;
The heel of a priest may tread thee down.
And a tyrant work thee woe;
But never a truth has been destroy'd;
They may curse it and call it crime;
Pervert and betray, or slander and slay,
Its teachers for a time;
Bat the sunshine aye shall light the sky.
As round and round we run;
And the Truth shall ever come uppermost,
And Justice shall be done.
And live there now such men as these-
With thoughts like the great of old?
Many have died in their misery,
And left their thought untold;
And many live, and are rank'd as mad,
And placed in the cold world's ban.
For sending their bright far-seeing souls
Three centuries in the van.
They toil in penury and grief,
Unknown, if not malign'd;
Forlorn, forlorn, hearing the scorn
Of the meantest of mankind!
But yet the world goes round and round,
And the genial seasons run;
And ever the Truth comes uppermost.
And ever is Justice done."
750,Emotion,JusticePoemsJusticeIsAMaidSoPrudePoembyAniruddhaPathak,"A Corolla came speeding, half asleep,
Right on pavement— a family's sole home
Under the sky's wide open dome,
And killed a few right in their sleep.
There was much that the media said
On the pitfalls of partying,
Of too much drinking,
As on drunken driving,
On dangers of heedless speeding,
But li'le was said in victim's aid.
In today's times truth is a helpless maid,
Not fair that flies on legal wings.
And much was said and argued
In favour and against,
But justice is a maid so prude
That truth must be red-handed best.
So after much was said,
The issue was threadbare laid,
When all that came went home,
Few thought of the hapless few
Sleeping under open dome,
And none alas had a clue.

754,Emotion,JusticePoemsJusticeDeniedInMassachusettsPoembyEdnaStVincentMillay,"Let us abandon then our gardens and go home
And sit in the sitting-room
Shall the larkspur blossom or the corn grow under this cloud?
Sour to the fruitful seed
Is the cold earth under this cloud,
Fostering quack and weed, we have marched upon but cannot
conquer;
We have bent the blades of our hoes against the stalks of them.
Let us go home, and sit in the sitting room.
Not in our day
Shall the cloud go over and the sun rise as before,
Beneficent upon us
Out of the glittering bay,
And the warm winds be blown inward from the sea
Moving the blades of corn
With a peaceful sound.
Forlorn, forlorn,
Stands the blue hay-rack by the empty mow.
And the petals drop to the ground,
Leaving the tree unfruited.
The sun that warmed our stooping backs and withered the weed
uprooted—
We shall not feel it again.
We shall die in darkness, and be buried in the rain.
What from the splendid dead
We have inherited —
Furrows sweet to the grain, and the weed subdued —
See now the slug and the mildew plunder.
Evil does overwhelm
The larkspur and the corn;
We have seen them go under.
Let us sit here, sit still,
Here in the sitting-room until we die;
At the step of Death on the walk, rise and go;
Leaving to our children's children the beautiful doorway,
And this elm,
And a blighted earth to till
With a broken hoe."
755,Emotion,JusticePoemsJusticeArnettPoembyEdgarLeeMasters,"It is true, fellow citizens,
That my old docket lying there for years
On a shelf above my head and over
The seat of justice, I say it is true
That docket had an iron rim
Which gashed my baldness when it fell --
(Somehow I think it was shaken loose
By the heave of the air all over town
When the gasoline tank at the canning works
Blew up and burned Butch Weldy) --
But let us argue points in order,
And reason the whole case carefully:
First I concede my head was cut,
But second the frightful thing was this:
The leaves of the docket shot and showered
Around me like a deck of cards
In the hands of a sleight of hand performer.
And up to the end I saw those leaves
Till I said at last, ""Those are not leaves,
Why, can't you see they are days and days
And the days and days of seventy years?
And why do you torture me with leaves
And the little entries on them?"
756,Emotion,JusticePoemsASenseOfJusticePoembyHerbertNehrlich,"A timid boy, that's what he was.
A nerd in school, though into sports,
observing all his hometown laws
but drifting laterally, of sorts.
His senses had developed well,
but with his parents being strict
he felt dependent  (all could tell) ,
much like a dog that has been kicked.
But something ripened in his mind,
it was a curious mix of fairness
and urgent need of being kind,
in conflict with acute awareness
that justice always must be done.
One day, while riding his new bike
in sweltering midsummer sun
he came upon a skinny tyke
in confrontation with a brute,
much older and more muscular.
The situation looked acute
and had progressed to vascular,
traumatic force, I mean red blood,
dripped from his nose into the mud.
The pair were totally mismatched,
the brute was known in town as tough.
The little guy, he must have hatched
twelve years before, it was enough!
Our nerd put on the stand his bike
and ordered Brute to stop the fight.
The answer was 'go take a hike
or I will crush you with my might.'
For those of you who've ever felt
the presence of adrenalin,
you would have loved that first quick belt,
which landed on the big guy's chin.
Without assistance from the kid
the daylights were then beaten out
of one who worked and lived amid
God-fearing people as a stout,
and tough and overbearing fellow.
His failing was lack of respect,
his colour as of then bright yellow.
He'd seek the weak and then select
the time and place where he could meet
his victims for a knuckle dusting.
Had never once met with defeat,
and on that day his eyes were lusting
for blood and glory, lots of tears.
But his opponent had decided
to shed all shyness and his fears,
and, from that moment he was guided
by Justice and the rights of man.
There was a rather quick conclusion,
our hero mumbled 'Yes, I can',
the case was clear, with no confusion.
The Brute had lost his reputation,
for, in the villages and valleys
the outcome had been a sensation.
And in the dark, sinister alleys,
the Brute was never seen again.
He had become a laughing stock
and never scared another man.
Much later Nerd became a Doc."
757,Emotion,JusticePoemsOnAFigureOfJusticeWithBoundEyesPoembyRobertLaurenceBinyon,"Unhappy goddess! Has then envious earth
Denied thine eyes the radiance of thy birth?
Have mortals, that still need thy voice to school
Their wrangling lives, their daily feuds to rule,
That thou might'st judge with stern and equal mind,
Swayed by no fear or favour, made thee blind?
Immortal, yet with bound and vacant eye,
How sad an emblem of humanity!
Thou bearest the poised scales, the uplifted sword,
Dealing to each his sentence and award.
Infinite acts in tedious array,
Their petty quarrels, at thy feet they lay.
Thou hearest: and dost thou require no more,
No subtler knowledge, no profounder lore?
Hast thou searched out the individual heart?
Or deem'st thou each its fellow's counterpart?
Ah, what wronged mind might not those eyes have read,
With light and with compassion visited,
Let the soiled page of obscure lots unroll,
Nor from deeds judged, but from the striving soul!
Teased by such strife, and yet, 'mid all its din,
Conscious and proud of heavenly rays within,
Know'st thou no hour when thy long labours seem
Fruitless as foolish, a preposterous dream!
When some imperious impulse bids thee scorn
The bonds of use, no longer to be borne,
And with indignant tears at tasks so vain,
Dash down thy scales, and snap thy sword in twain;
Leave man to end his wrongs from his own store
Of wisdom, and revisit earth no more?"

Delayed justice is better than no justice.
The world will always be round.
Facts cannot be altered; prejudice
Is a major impediment to reach sound
Justice. Justice is all we want,
Fairness is what we fight for,
Justice is what we cry for,
Fairness is what we want.
All lives are special.
All God's children are beautiful.
All colors are essential,
To make the rainbow normal.
Justice, Justice is what we want,
Fairness is what we fight for.
Equality under the law is critical.
Equal shade can only make the rainbow
More beautiful and more impartial;
No justice will always be a Big No, No.
Justice is what we cry for,
Fairness is what we want.
The world will always be round.
Finally, we can hear the sound
Of the bells. Justice is around
The corner; she is upward bound.
Delayed justice is better than no justice."
759,Emotion,JusticePoemsForgetNotDivineJusticePoembyRameshTA,"Forget Not Divine Justice!
What discrepancies
Be corrected by what measures
We don't know,
But divine justice sure will
Do rectify them one day or other!
Man made justice
May be duped by loop holes of law,
But divine justice
Will surely take revenge
To bring order to world one day!
Till then the boat
Will only go with the stream current
And who can render
Justice to all the crimes
That are piling up on?
We can only
Just wait and watch ever
What's going on
Before our own eyes here to
learn lessons from experience!"
760,Emotion,JusticePoemsJusticePoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"For those who reap us of thousands of grand’s
Lavish their wealth on treasures of the land
Justice often does us no right on this stand
For it gives the culprits only a helping hand
Justice is sometimes wrong
Justice is meant to be honour
Justice is sometimes strong
Justice is meant to be society’s formidable cure
With words I can create drama
With written words I cannot stammer
But Justice will do us no right in this drama
For I am called black but I got a white mama
In vain I see no reasonable sense
In this precluded abstract nonsense
And as Justice wears again its white robes
I sincerely hope that it will always accurately probe

Check out my latest 'Justice & If I were a girl'"
761,Emotion,JusticePoemsJusticePoembyHerbertNehrlich,"An eighteen-legged female spider
had fallen in a vat of cider.
She struggled with her puny legs
and lost, due to the fear, her eggs.
The spiderwife began to panic
and feared she would, like the Titanic,
end at the bottom, thus deep down,
(non-swimming spiders often drown) .
She pledged to be a brave example,
to struggle while she still had ample
tenacity and strong reserves.
She would ignore her fraying nerves.
The spider's movements now were slowing
as all her glycogen was going.
But, just before the final minute
she yelled: 'The cider, aren't I in it? '
And, within seconds she had found
that she now stood on solid ground.
That moment, when the farmer's mother
checked on the cider and said  'BROTHER! '
It had become a solid mess,
the why was anybody's guess.
The eggs had dropped into the cider,
been agitated by the spider,
eventually it had become
eggnog without a hint of rum.
Relieved, the spiderwoman rested
outside the vat, when (hairy-chested) ,
a frog hopped over, just to see.
He asked 'To Be Or Not To Be? '
Of course he ate the little spider,
then stuck his tongue into the cider

763,Emotion,JusticePoemsLiveWithJusticePoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"I assumed him wrong
He was not to be taken for real song
It was my greatest error
He was unlucky for ever
I had starved for him to be one
But he cared for nothing or none
He proved black sheep in real sense
It made me worrisome and tense
I was rushing in daytime
To see him anywhere anytime
I never bothered about hot sun
I was ready to go to any length or run
He has taken every inch of me
I have been made scapegoat to flee
With no place to go for safety
He has caused me lot of worries
I am no small chicken
I shall fight it out even
I know how to face each angle!
I can never be pushed to fail
I know I have been wronged
Yet it is fully managed
I shall survive and show
That life still can have easy water flow
He took me simply for sex object
Even though I knew it was tricky act
I had idea of withering storm
But let it go on reality term
I raise my head with honor
Even if he proved deserter
I want each woman folk to live with justice
So no one can break word or promise"

Provide us just scales
with which to measure
determine the truth
provide no displeasure
be objective and distant
make sure you're blindfolded
mete out the verdict
swift and without fail.
But for the value of life
remember your own
Each breath you take
opportunities blown
Justice is never served
for the dead remain dead
their chances forfeited
memories defaulted
punitive arrangements
may placate the bereaved
but the dead remain deceased.

765,Emotion,JusticePoemsScalesOfJusticePoembyivororivorehogg,"There is a law which guarantees
that as you sow so shall you reap,
there’s no point in not guilty pleas.
The record keeper never sleeps.
That which you give you will receive.
The correct balance must be kept
just simple justice I believe.
You have no choice you must accept
The punishment that you deserve.
Forget the lies you have been taught
repenting misdeeds will not serve.
Your protestations count for nought.
The scales must balance exactly.
The  credit and the debit side,
no one is punished unjustly.
The law is equally applied.
There’s only you gives evidence
before a jury of your peers,
with wisdom and experience
to understand your hopes and fears
They will advise you that’s what they do.
About the things you need to learn
but the decisions left to you.
To choose to rest or quick return.
To start again with a clean sheet.
Another chance for you to earn
the merits needed to complete
the lessons which you need to learn.
Each life we live a step towards
a destination still unknown
Where we receive our just rewards
because we are at last full grown.

not waiting for the transports to board,
just searching the peace that is lost,
opportunities missed and the destiny tainted.
rugs are cleaner and not with punctures,
in certain place, but looking at these juncture,
why are these people let to wear such attires,
Why aren't they cared and seen as equal?
When sugar, grains and spices are procured,
value their sweat to value these commodities,
Why do the rich want to buy these necessities,
at the price of these poor countries?
The beautiful blouse that we wear,
the elegant shirts that covered with the coats,
branded ties, meticulous belts and shoes,
believe me, might have been made,
with 25 cents per hour petty salary,
their children are alive half empty,
while our children are obese and naughty,
these people do not have to go to hell,
as they already live a life of hell,
where they drink untreated water,
frequent power cuts, clogged drains,
herbal remedies, god given diseases,
entertained by the music of mosquitoes."

Mock the hungry and the destitute
And when we disregard the plight of the poor
And return home to our feasts and our comfy furniture

Big it was, with white teeth.
As soon as he beckoned, I ran.
I ran untill I found you.

Once more before I die.

Who threatened my gardener.

At different rates according to
the differing of circumstance
When he knew freedom the time flew
But when confines there’s little chance
Of happiness that once knew.

For something which he had not done.

when facing death. Though he will try
to show that he is not afraid.
There is still chance of a reprieve
Which would correct the error made.
He has no choice but to believe.
That some last minute miracle
will save him from the hangman’s noose.
He knows it is illogical

and pour them out
on the side of the road
where families are dying...
or you can take them
to any street corner
in the world, where young
boys and girls are sold like meat,
and take your hands
and rub them on their ashen faces...

772,Emotion,JusticePoemsTheWorldsJusticePoembyEmmaLazarus,"If the sudden tidings came
That on some far, foreign coast,
Buried ages long from fame,
Had been found a remnant lost
Of that hoary race who dwelt
By the golden Nile divine,
Spake the Pharaoh's tongue and knelt
At the moon-crowned Isis' shrine-
How at reverend Egypt's feet,
Pilgrims from all lands would meet!
If the sudden news were known,
That anigh the desert-place
Where once blossomed Babylon,
Scions of a mighty race
Still survived, of giant build,
Huntsmen, warriors, priest and sage,
Whose ancestral fame had filled,
Trumpet-tongued, the earlier age,
How at old Assyria's feet
Pilgrims from all lands would meet!
Yet when Egypt's self was young,
And Assyria's bloom unworn,
Ere the mythic Homer sung,
Ere the gods of Greece were born,
Lived the nation of one God,
Priests of freedom, sons of Shem,
Never quelled by yoke or rod,
Founders of Jerusalem-
Is there one abides to-day,
Seeker of dead cities, say!
Answer, now as then, THEY ARE;
Scattered broadcast o'er the lands,
Knit in spirit nigh and far,
With indissoluble bands.
Half the world adores their God,
They the living law proclaim,
And their guerdon is-the rod,
Stripes and scourgings, death and shame.
Still on Israel's head forlorn,
Every nation heaps its scorn."

Those convicts whose lives that came on the fleets.
Whose lives were full of suffering were tough.
No one cares, no one helps, no one can see,
To live life being homeless is not swell,
Not a choice, as sometimes we need to flee,
From our present lives, not die in a well.
No food, no shelter, no blankets at night,
To try to find a way to stay alive,
And even sometimes get into a fight,
Some may suffer, but there are some who thrive.
We are normal people, but none can tell,
That we are human and all should be well.

We adulated you, my God, impatiently then.
Requesting you to allow rains to rain,

Hungry we were and in search of bread,
In search of water, tears we had to shed.
Nothing we could do other than devotion,
Expiating always for all the committed sins.
No one could stop the harsh man slaughter
No one could bring on dry lips a laughter.
Then came a day, the day of your glory,
Every side fainted with cats and dogs raining.
What is this unjust justice, I could'nt guess,
Oh God, do you want us only difficulties to face."

The load our sons must bear."
778,Emotion,JusticePoemsWanderingJusticePoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"Wandering Justice
O! Dear, have I hit a miss?
With wandering justice
When society systems fail
And someone goes to jail
Without any chance of bail
Or ever setting out again on sea to sail
For something they did not do; it is a sad tale
When there is war instead of peace
And dignified people are looking for ass to kiss
Where is justice?
Countries are suffering in health and poverty
Whilst others are enjoying wealth and property
Where is justice?
O! Dear, have I hit a miss?
With wandering justice
When someone you love
Is taken away to the skies above
Where is the justice?
When you read endlessly to take exams
Another passes it with some fraudulent scam
Where is the justice?
When all your life you work so hard
Doesn’t it get you viciously mad?
When the jackpot hits another who is bad
Where is the justice?
When life takes away your child
Because you ignored health symptoms as mild
Where is the justice?
At work when your original innovations
Reward your boss with a standing ovation
Followed by a double or triple promotion
And all you get from the boss is a caution
Where is the justice?
When living a healthy life is nothing but a trick
As destiny picks on you for the sake of a kick
With illnesses for the unhealthy and the weak
All the same you are the one who ends up sick
Where is the justice?
O! Dear, have I hit a miss?
With wandering justice
Fair for all is what I call justice
Moments of rewarding bliss
When a man plants his seeds
Creating numerous mouths to feed
And he provides them with all their needs
I call it Justice!
When you work hard
Indulging in good not bad
And life rewards make you so glad
I call it Justice!
Yet justice often wanders away
Before you have your chance of say
When it wanders, the price is often high to pay
O! Dear, have I hit a miss?
With wandering justice
As it leaves behind a trail of flaws
That is not within the confinement of fair law!"

For a long time and even now,
Justice
Is never irrelevant to us.
Very often, we wonder how
Come we are always
The victims, the culprits,
The ones who get dumped in the pits
In the shallow graves.
We get killed by being in the wrong place
At the wrong time.
We get mace on our face
For no reasons.
A horrendous crime
Is being perpetrated this season
By the namby pamby warden,
Who should be in jail, in prison.
This is high treason
For not respecting valor,
Uniforms, candor
And peers.
No one cheers,
Once ignorance
And malfeasance
Show up at the door
Of the poor
Victims.
Everyone screams,
Because the injustice
Is blatantly obvious.
This is somewhat peculiar.
The skin color
Of the Scholar
Is the matter.
The brother and the sister
Finally got a job,
But when the stock broker
Can no longer rob
The poor clients;
The brother and the sister,
Who were last hired,
Are the first saints
To be fired.
Our offspring is profiled
From the crib;
Our progenitor is defiled
Anon, at the bottom of the crypt.
Justice
Is never irrelevant to us.

780,Emotion,JusticePoemsVictimWasKilledJusticeTooPoembyAniruddhaPathak,"O shy maiden, cooking a time-torn dish,
You sail on high seas, always far from beach,
Ensconced in thine lofty principled niche,
When arrive, is not it too late to reach?
I feel thine conscience is still alive,
Ye show lady justice blind. But she's lame.
Stays and delays her single most ill-fame,
What good, in two decades should she arrive?
If there be wrong that whole world has well seen,
The court it seems is not satisfied still,
No crime leaves confession, nor yet signed will,
Time, justice contemplates and looks within.
A victim of justice is good as killed,
But there's one more— whole legal edifice,
And the system, with bureaucracy filled,
And true victim is the very justice.
Ye bank too much on the letter of law,
But letter's fine if it carries spirit,
Blindfolded, justice can still be in awe,
Too much process makes justice no more fit.
Thine chairs sticky seem of privileges,
Ready to threaten with contempt of court,
Lofty chairs too serve public on wages,
No one need sit in an isolate fort.
And here the courts woke up by public noise;
I wish it'd kept its own alarm warnings,
But was reposed on procedural poise,
When stirred it walked when should fly on all wings.
Let courts rid old baggage, all the vain load,
It should still run, let jagged get the rough road.

The killers of Jessica Lall virtually walked away free. Let's not blame just the powerful and rich perpetrators of the crime. The real culprit here seems to be our legal and judicial system, and the law enforcers. She scarce is the only victim. The true Victim is justice itself. Victim, is our collective conscience as well, and our collective heart hardening fast.

This unapparent fairness
Supposed to combine rather than divide
Just a word that likes to hide
This unapparent fairness
What is justice?
Justice, is between you and if you are righteous
And you might just be righteous,
But you don’t have the intelligence of the truths of real justice.
Justice, is merely impossible because we have created injustice.
And just this.
It may be a tongue twister to read
But justice is a twist of the tongue indeed
A twist of the lung, you can’t breathe
A twist of the fun, full of hypocrisy and greed
A fake term misused, abused of its creed
Our mouths say justice, but injustice is what we really speak
And just this.
What is justice?
This unapparent fairness
Supposed to combine rather than divide
Just a word that likes to hide
This unapparent fairness
What is justice?
Just a word, and just this.

784,Emotion,JusticePoemsJusticeDelayedPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"Can justice be delayed under any circumstances?
Numerous cases can be sighted for instances
Can that not be amounted as justice denied?
Well, conscious should always bite if it is laid
Constitution enshrined for liberty and freedom
Forefathers too considered and thought it as wisdom
Sacrifice made for freedom struggle should not go as waste
To live with true freedom was need of an hour and taste
Still many loop holes remain to be plugged
System is facing criticism and it is wholly bugged
Justice is sold as revealed with emergence of new facts
it is cleverly wrapped in words with simple tact
Under official ret act, nothing can be made public or revealed
Under the oath of secrecy it is cleverly concealed
Normal man can’t dream for getting immediate relief
Loosing faith and trust as mark of disbelief
Innocents are sometimes hung for nothing
Trial summary drags on for years to prove something
History teeters and goons rule the scene
it has been  made laughing stock which is never witnessed or seen
Conscience like things has remained on paper
Evidences or approver turn hostile and proof is tempered
Solitary examples shine and keep the system alive
Does the system require honest trial for self and to be revived?
Politicians have corrupted and citizens too have favored
Easy ill gotten money plays part with fragrance and flavor
who would not want to become rich and famous?
Leading lavish life with style and look so glamorous
Death sentence can’t be implemented for simple reason
Wrong move for computation of term for person tried under treason
Still some of us praise the system and sing for liberty
How can it grow amidst the illiteracy and poverty?
Nothing can l change under the light and sun
we will tear it apart by making mockery and fun
Streets will have deserted look under the shadow of gun
People may seek refuge under constant fear and run
Such may be the scene in coming days
You will be caught in cross fire in strange ways
You will have no high hope in bright rays
It may be altogether different if we don’t pay (attention)
No one should be deprived of his/her legitimate dues
System should not be meant for only few
Why is it so that only influential get scoot free
Why other have to sit recite the hymns under the tree?
Let holy principles of justice be upheld
Let innocents be not prosecuted and held
It may or can have legitimate delay
This may send the message across and relay"

Decayed hamlet; dark shapes,
Singing mothers in the evening wind;
At windows Angelus and hands fold.
Still birth; on green ground
Mystery and stillness of blue flowers.
Insanity opens the purple mouth:
Dies irae - grave and stillness.
Groping along green thorns;
In the sleep: blood-vomit, hunger and laughter;
Fire in the village, awakening in the green;
Fear and swaying on gurgling boat.
Or in wooden staircase again
The white shadow of the strange woman leans.-
Poor sinner longing away in the blueness
Left his putrefaction behind for lilies and rats."

Stands dazed by the pyre,
Waiting for the next victims,
To be put on pyre.

Shrouded in fear, numb,
Wailing widows, children orphaned,
Flashed across the streets like lambs.
Up on a platform,
A wolf in whites, roaring,
Loudspeaker blowing,

Nation salutes the resolute spirit.
Living race can’t wait five years,
Think and decide today.

their sense
what justice is and how it should be dispensed like a blindfolded lady
that you misunderstand with her scales on one hand and a sword
on the other,
do not be shaken, do not lose hope, heave a sigh and breathe
the remaining clean air,
there are still those who in silence still remain steadfast
holding on to truth
and keeping their hands clean and hearts pure and minds active
to the pursuit of this eternal approximation
of fairness
there are still those whose eyes still daze to the glitters not of gold
but of truth, beauty, and goodness,
i will count you in
please count me in too
and how about you?
i ask, please be counted
we shall stand on the good side of things
we shall look for the brightest star

Or I their force should know;
And, if thou strike me into dust,
My soul approves the blow.
The heart, that values less its ease
Than it adores thy ways,
In thine avenging anger sees
A subject of its praise.
Pleased I could lie, concealed and lost,
In shades of central night;
Not to avoid thy wrath, thou know'st,
But lest I grieve thy sight.
Smite me, O thou, whom I provoke!
And I will love thee still:
The well deserved and righteous stroke
Shall please me, though it kill.
Am I not worthy to sustain
The worst thou canst devise;
And dare I seek thy throne again,
And meet thy sacred eyes?
Far from afflicting, thou art kind;
And, in my saddest hours,
An unction of thy grace I find,
Pervading all my powers.
Alas! thou sparest me yet again;
And, when thy wrath should move,
Too gentle to endure my pain,
Thou soothest me with thy love.
I have no punishment to fear;
But, ah! that smile from thee
Imparts a pang far more severe
Than woe itself would be."

But love with peace and justice only decades away
In fifty years or less from now there won't be mistrust and hate
The war lords and the men of war will have passed their use by date.
Those who love peace and justice are beginning to unite
And for the men who worship war their loss of power in sight
Soon war jets will not fly the sky under the cloak of night
And those who promote harmony will be the men of might.
The yearn for peace is spreading getting stronger by the day
And those who are divisive will not have a part to play
In the World of the future the racist and the cruel
Will not have any power at all only the just will rule.
The children who are born today will surely live to see
A World of peace and harmony and of war and hatred free
For the yearn for peace is spreading and with each passing day it grow
And war will be unheard of in forty years or so."

Jesus! whose blood so freely stream'd
To satisfy the law's demand;
By Thee from guilt and wrath redeem'd,
Before the Father's face I stand.
To reconcile offending man,
Make Justice drop her angry rod;
What creature could have form'd the plan,
Or who fulfil it but a God?
No drop remains of all the curse,
For wretches who deserved the whole;
No arrows dipt in wrath to pierce
The guilty, but returning soul.
Peace by such means so dearly bought,
What rebel could have hoped to see?
Peace by his injured Sovereign wrought,
His Sovereign fasten'd to a tree.
Now, Lord, Thy feeble worm prepare!
For strife with earth and hell begins;
Conform and gird me for the war;
They hate the soul that hates his sins.
Let them in horrid league agree!
They may assault, they may distress;
But cannot quench Thy love to me,
Nor rob me of the Lord my peace."
796,Emotion,PeacePoemsIFindNoPeacePoembySirThomasWyatt,"I find no peace, and all my war is done.
I fear and hope. I burn and freeze like ice.
I fly above the wind, yet can I not arise;
And nought I have, and all the world I season.
That loseth nor locketh holdeth me in prison
And holdeth me not--yet can I scape no wise--
Nor letteth me live nor die at my device,
And yet of death it giveth me occasion.
Without eyen I see, and without tongue I plain.
I desire to perish, and yet I ask health.
I love another, and thus I hate myself.
I feed me in sorrow and laugh in all my pain;
Likewise displeaseth me both life and death,
And my delight is causer of this strife."
797,Emotion,PeacePoemsOSunOfRealPeacePoembyWaltWhitman,"O SUN of real peace! O hastening light!
O free and extatic! O what I here, preparing, warble for!
O the sun of the world will ascend, dazzling, and take his height--
and you too, O my Ideal, will surely ascend!
O so amazing and broad--up there resplendent, darting and burning!
O vision prophetic, stagger'd with weight of light! with pouring
glories!
O lips of my soul, already becoming powerless!
O ample and grand Presidentiads! Now the war, the war is over!
New history! new heroes! I project you!
Visions of poets! only you really last! sweep on! sweep on!
O heights too swift and dizzy yet!                                 10

798,Emotion,PeacePoemsTheBankruptPeaceMakerPoembyVachelLindsay,"I opened the ink-well and smoke filled the room.
The smoke formed the giant frog-cat of my doom.
His web feet left dreadful slime tracks on the floor.
He had hammer and nails that he laid by the door.
He sprawled on the table, claw-hands in my hair.
He looked through my heart to the mud that was there.
Like a black-mailer hating his victim he spoke:
""When I see all your squirming I laugh till I choke
Singing of peace. Railing at battle.
Soothing a handful with saccharine prattle.
All the millions of earth have voted for fight.
You are voting for talk, with hands lily white.""
He leaped to the floor, then grew seven feet high,
Beautiful, terrible, scorn in his eye:
The Devil Eternal, Apollo grown old,
With beard of bright silver and garments of gold.
""What will you do to end war for good?
Will you stand by the book-case, be nailed to the wood?""
I stretched out my arms. He drove the nails deep,
Silently, coolly. The house was asleep,
I hung for three years, forbidden to die.
I seemed but a shadow the servants passed by.
At the end of the time with hot irons he returned.
""The Quitter Sublime"" on my bosom he burned.
As he seared me he hissed: ""You are wearing away.
The good angels tell me you leave them today.
You want to come down from the nails in the door.
The victor must hang there three hundred years more.
If any prig-saint would outvote all mankind
He must use an immortally resolute mind.
Think what the saints of Benares endure,
Through infinite birthpangs their courage is sure.
Self-tortured, self-ruled, they build their powers high,
Until they are gods, overmaster the sky.""
Then he pulled out the nails. He shouted ""Come in.""
To heal me there stepped in a lady of sin.
Her hand was in mine. We walked in the sun.
She said: ""Now forget them, the Saxon and Hun.
You are dreary and aged and silly and weak.
Let us smell the sweet groves. Let the summertime speak.""
We walked to the river. We swam there in state.
I was a serpent. She was my mate.
I forgot in the marsh, as I tumbled about,
That trial in my room, where I did not hold out.
Since I was a serpent, my mate seemed to me
As a mermaiden seems to a fisher at sea,
Or a whisky soaked girl to a whisky soaked king.
I woke. She had turned to a ravening thing
On the table — a buzzard with leperous head.
She tore up my rhymes and my drawings. She said:
""I am your own cheap bankrupt soul.
Will you die for the nations, making them whole?
We joy in the swamp and here we are gay.
Will you bring your fine peace to the nations today?"""
799,Emotion,PeacePoemsPeaceBeWithYouLatinPaxVobiscumPoembyRajaramRamachandran,"Oh God! I need a quiet place,
Where flows the nectar of peace,
Not that kind of dead peace,
In the grave, one finds with ease.
I went to the Himalayas Mountain,
But peace there was no certain,
As the solitude tore my mind,
A little peace when I tried to find.
I heard good spiritual lectures,
Those from eminent preachers,
For peace, I left no place unturned,
But with a perturbed mind I returned.
Tell me, oh God, that unknown place,
Where lies that elusive peace,
What I need, now I can find,
So, I’ll have peace of mind.
God answered, “Hey you fool,
First learn to keep yourself cool,
Don’t search elsewhere out,
But dive deep into your heart.”
“Peace isn’t an object that lies outside,
But it’s a feeling that’s generated inside.
Learn to cultivate peace in your heart.
To enjoy this peace, better you now start.”
“Know this I’m in your heart.
I fill it up with peace quite a lot.
This divine peace when you merit,
No need to go elsewhere for it.”"

I marvel at what I see and hear.
Why, I ponder , is the world at war?
Why, I lament, should the world know no peace?
You world Powers! Put your ammunition in its arsenal.
Enough of nuclear wars, enough of threats of war.
The Lilliputian Third World walking under your Gangatuan feet,
Was created by God just as God created you.
Your duty, it is to help it outgrow its groping stage.
There should be no re-occurrence of the war in Vietnam,
No more fracas in Surinam,
No repeat performance of the Soweto imbroglio.
Rwanda should not be put asunder.
Enough of the Somalia saga.
Ethiopia and Liberia experience we want no more.
Let peace reign in Bosnia Herzegovina.
'No' to war I say, 'Yes' to peace I maintain.
War does no good to anyone.
War kills, war maims, war annihilates.
Turmoil and tribulation all characterize war.
Famine and deprivation are all babies of war.
Wars tear families apart, refugees abound everywhere.
Many are rendered homeless, a lot become hopeless.
Causalities of war in the scenes of ravage and wreck,
Letter the ground in their hundreds and thousands.
Let's have a new world order.
Let's make peace our watchword.
Let peace reign supreme in the world.
Peace brings joy; peace puts the mind at rest.
The world must embrace peace, not war.
The world must live, in peace, not in pieces.
'No' to war I say, 'Yes' to peace I maintain."

Trembling of purple banners in the fight,
Wild neigh of horses in destruction's path,
Howling of trumpets answering yells of wrath,
Dim eyes where slowly fades the living light;
And on the plains, the ghastly heaped up death
O'er which the guns thunder their dull refrain;
And summer is shamed and autumn grieves in rain,
And carnage breathes abroad a hateful breath.
Back! O thou nightmare of the tired world's rest!
The Spring sees blooming at the mother's breast
Pink mouths of babes with cooing laughter rife;
While from the valley to the mountain springs,
Amid the rustle of zephyrs and of wings,
Sound, like young heart-beats, all the bells of Life."

811,Emotion,PeacePoemsThePeaceOfJerusalemPoembyBobGotti,"We as Believers are admonished to pray for the peace of Jerusalem,
But how or when, to this troubled city, could true peace ever come?
It has had more bloodshed than any other city in the history of man,
But Jerusalem remains the central focus of The Lord's Eternal Plan.
Dialog with both sides will lead to peace is the world's deduction,
When they say peace and safety they'll only see sudden destruction.
The Arabs talk of peace with Israel, as they desire to destroy them,
And they even talk about making their capital the city of Jerusalem.
True Peace in Israel is not being discussed in any Arab Convention,
But peace my friend will only come through The Lord's intervention.
Israel is seeking peace with her enemies by diplomatic negotiations,
While ignoring God's command not to make a treaty with the nations.
For they need not man in time of need but only for God to intercede,
But again, they lean to others just like Egypt that splintered reed,
Now Christ enthroned in Heaven laughs as the nations plot in vain,
For God's Eternal Plan for His City Jerusalem will remain the same.
Jerusalem has been the capital of Israel for three thousand years,
And through history it's been the focus of Prophets and many seers.
They all pointed to a glorious time, for the greatest to the least,
When Messiah will finally reign on David's Throne to be their Peace.

And all life's ripening harvest-fields await
The restless sickle of relentless fate.
But I, sweet Soul, rejoice that I was born,
When from the climbing terraces of corn
I watch the golden orioles of Thy morn.
What care I for the world's desire and pride,
Who know the silver wings that gleam and glide,
The homing pigeons of Thine eventide?
What care I for the world's loud weariness,
Who dream in twilight granaries Thou dost bless
With delicate sheaves of mellow silences?
Say, shall I heed dull presages of doom,
Or dread the rumoured loneliness and gloom,
The mute and mythic terror of the tomb?
For my glad heart is drunk and drenched with Thee,
O inmost wind of living ecstasy!
O intimate essence of eternity!"

This morning.
They did not know what to do!
Had I flew the 'coop' with scorning?
I had always come to toss
To them popcorn or chips...
Something they ate I would leave them with!
They usually would peck and be on their way.
But this morning they sat as if to say:
'There's not a thing we can do with these!
Of that all of us pigeons have come to agree!
We expected at least a twig or stick thrown
A chicken bone or something sniffed and left alone!
Something to huddle around over...
To peck and pick!
Is this some kind of joke?
We protest this different shit!
Hey? Are you listening?
Do we have to fight over this? '
And as I began to leave this scene behind...
I pulled from my pocket a new minted dime.
I threw it and watched them trying to lift it together.
Believing the sparkling would bring them a peace,
They would find even better!
Bringing them with curiousity,
And touching each others' feathers!
It worked!"

waiting for their light. For a time
I rest in the grace of the world, and am free."
818,Emotion,PeacePoemsOnTheProspectOfPeacePoembyThomasTickell,"______ Sacerdos
Fronde super mitram, & felici comptus oliva.
Virg.
To the Lord Privy Seal
Contending kings, and fields of death, too long
Have been the subject of the British song.
Who hath not read of fam'd Ramillia's plain,
Bavaria's fall, and Danube choak'd with slain!
Exhausted themes! a gentler note I raise,
And sing returning peace in softer lays.
Their fury quell'd, and martial rage allay'd,
I wait our heroes in the sylvan shade:
Disbanding hosts are imag'd to my mind,
And warring powers in friendly leagues combin'd,
While ease and pleasure make the nations smile,
And Heaven and Anna bless Britannia's isle.
Well sends our queen her mitred Bristol forth,
For early counsels fam'd, and long-try'd worth;
Who, thirty rolling years, had oft withheld
The Swede and Saxon from the dusty field;
Completely form'd to heal the Christian wounds,
To name the kings, and give each kingdom bounds;
The face of ravag'd Nature to repair,
By leagues to soften Earth, and Heaven by prayer,
To gain by love, where rage and slaughter fail,
And make the crosier o'er the sword prevail.
So when great Moses, with Jehovah's wand,
Had scatter'd plagues o'er stubborn Pharaoh's land,
Now spread an host of locusts round the shore,
Now turn'd Nile's fattening streams to putrid gore;
Plenty and gladness mark'd the priest of God,
And sudden almonds shot from Aaron's rod.
O thou, from whom these bounteous blessings flow,
To whom, as chief, the hopes of peace we owe,
(For next to thee, the man whom kings contend
To style companion, and to make their friend,
Great Strafford, rich in every courtly grace,
With joyful pride accepts the second place)
From Britain's isle, and Isis' sacred spring,
One hour, oh! listen while the Muses sing.
Though ministers of mighty monarchs wait,
With beating hearts to learn their masters' fate,
One hour forbear to speak thy queen's commands,
Nor think the world, thy charge, neglected stands;
The blissful prospects, in my verse display'd
May lure the stubborn, the deceiv'd persuade:
Ev'n thou to peace shalt speedier urge the way,
And more be hasten'd by this short delay.
On the Prospect of Peace
The haughty Gaul, in ten campaigns o'erthrown,
Now ceas'd to think the western world his own.
Oft had he mourn'd his boasting leaders bound,
And his proud bulwarks smoking on the ground:
In vain with powers renew'd he fill'd the plain,
Made timorous vows, and brib'd the saints in vain;
As oft his legions did the fight decline,
Lurk'd in the trench, and skulk'd behind the line.
Before his eyes the fancied javelin gleams,
At feasts he starts, and seems dethron'd in dreams;
On glory past reflects with secret pain,
On mines exhausted, and on millions slain.
To Britain's queen the scepter'd suppliant bends,
To her his crowns and infant race commends,
Who grieves her fame with Christian blood to buy,
Nor asks for glory at a price so high.
At her decree, the war suspended stands,
And Britain's heroes hold their lifted hands,
Their open brows no threatening frowns disguise,
But gentler passions sparkle in their eyes.
The Gauls, who never in their courts could find
Such temper'd fire with manly beauty join'd,
Doubt if they 're those, whom, dreadful to the view,
In forms so fierce their fearful fancies drew;
At whose dire names ten thousand widows prest
Their helpless orphans clinging to the breast.
In silent rapture each his foe surveys;
They vow firm friendship, and give mutual praise.
Brave minds, howe'er at war, are secret friends;
Their generous discord with the battle ends;
In peace they wonder whence dissension rose,
And ask how souls so like could e'er be foes.
Methinks I hear more friendly shouts rebound,
And social clarions mix their sprightly sound.
The British flags are furl'd, her troops disband,
And scatter'd armies seek their native land.
The hardy veteran, proud of many a scar,
The manly charms and honours of the war,
Who hop'd to share his friends' illustrious doom,
And in the battle find a soldier's tomb,
Leans on his spear to take his farewell view,
And, sighing, bids the glorious camp adieu.
Ye generous fair, receive the brave with smiles,
O'erpay their sleepless nights, and crown their toils;
Soft beauty is the gallant soldier's due,
For you they conquer, and they bleed for you.
In vain proud Gaul with boastful Spain conspires,
When English valour English beauty fires;
The nations dread your eyes, and kings despair
Of chiefs so brave, till they have nymphs so fair.
See the fond wife in tears of transport drown'd,
Hugs her rough lord, and weeps o'er every wound,
Hangs on the lips that fields of blood relate,
And smiles, or trembles, at his various fate.
Near the full bowl he draws the fancy'd line,
And marks feign'd trenches in the flowing wine,
Then sets th' invested fort before his eyes,
And mines, that whirl'd battalions to the skies:
His little listening progeny turn pale,
And beg again to hear the dreadful tale.
Such dire achievements sings the bard, that tells
Of palfrey'd dames, bold knights, and magic spells,
Where whole brigades one champion's arms o'erthrow,
And cleave a giant at a random blow,
Slay paynims vile, that force the fair, and tame
The goblin's fury, and the dragon's flame.
Our eager youth to distant nations run,
To visit fields, their valiant fathers won;
From Flandria's shore their country's fame they trace,
Till far Germania shows her blasted face.
Th' exulting Briton asks his mournful guide,
Where his hard fate the lost Bavaria try'd:
Where Stepney grav'd the stone to Anna's fame,
He points to Blenheim, once a vulgar name;
Here fled the Household, there did Tallard yield,
Here Marlborough turn'd the fortune of the field,
On those steep banks, near Danube's raging flood:
The Gauls thrice started back, and trembling stood:
When, Churchill's arm perceiv'd, they stood not long,
But plung'd amidst the waves, a desperate throng,
Crowds whelm'd on crowds dash'd wide the watery-bed,
And drove the current to its distant head.
As, when by Raphael's, or by Kneller's hands
A warlike courser on the canvas stands,
Such as on Landen bleeding Ormond bore,
Or set young Ammon on the Granic shore;
If chance a generous steed the work behold,
He snorts, he neighs, he champs the foamy gold:
So, Hocstet seen, tumultuous passions roll,
And hints of glory fire the Briton's soul,
In fancy'd fights he sees the troops engage,
And all the tempest of the battle rage.
Charm me, ye powers, with scenes less nobly bright,
Far humbler thoughts th' inglorious Muse delight,
Content to see the honours of the field
By plough-shares levell'd, or in flowers conceal'd.
O'er shatter'd walls may creeping ivy twine,
And grass luxuriant clothe the harmless mine.
Tame flocks ascend the breach without a wound,
Or crop the bastion, now a fruitful ground;
While shepherds sleep, along the rampard laid,
Or pipe beneath the formidable shade.
Who was the man? Oblivion blast his name,
Torn out, and blotted from the list of Fame!
Who, fond of lawless rule, and proudly brave,
First sunk the filial subject to a slave,
His neighbour's realms by frauds unkingly gain'd,
In guiltless blood the sacred ermine stain'd,
Laid schemes for death, to slaughter turn'd his heart,
And fitted murder to the rules of art.
Ah! curst Ambition, to thy lures we owe
All the great ills, that mortals bear below.
Curst by the hind, when to the spoil he yields
His year's whole sweat, and vainly ripen'd fields;
Curst by the maid, torn from her lover's side,
When left a widow, though not yet a bride;
By mothers curst, when floods of tears they shed,
And scatter useless roses on the dead.
Oh, sacred Bristol! then, what dangers prove
The arts, thou smil'st on with paternal love?
Then, mixt with rubbish by the brutal foes,
In vain the marble breathes, the canvas glows;
To shades obscure the glittering sword pursues
The gentle poet, and defenceless Muse.
A voice like thine, alone, might then asswage
The warrior's fury, and control his rage;
To hear thee speak, might the fierce Vandal stand,
And fling the brandish'd sabre from his hand.
Far hence be driven to Scythia's stormy shore
The drum's harsh music, and the cannon's roar;
Let grim Bellona haunt the lawless plain,
Where Tartar clans and grizly Cossacks reign;
Let the steel'd Turk be deaf to matrons' cries,
See virgins ravish'd with relentless eyes,
To death grey heads and smiling infants doom,
Nor spare the promise of the pregnant womb,
O'er wasted kingdoms spread his wide command,
The savage lord of an unpeopled land.
Her guiltless glory just Britannia draws
From pure religion, and impartial laws,
To Europe's wounds a mother's aid she brings,
And holds in equal scales the rival kings:
Her generous sons in choicest gifts abound,
Alike in arms, alike in arts renown'd.
As when sweet Venus (so the fable sings)
Awak'd by Nereids, from the ocean springs,
With smiles she sees the threatening billows rise,
Spreads smooth the surge, and clears the louring skies.
Light, o'er the deep, with fluttering Cupids crown'd,
The pearly couch and silver turtles bound;
Her tresses shed ambrosial odours round.
Amidst the world of waves so stands serene
Britannia's isle, the ocean's stately queen;
In vain the nations have conspired her fall,
Her trench the sea, and fleets her floating wall:
Defenceless barks, her powerful navy near,
Have only waves and hurricanes to fear.
What bold invader, or what land opprest,
Hath not her anger quell'd, her aid redrest!
Say, where have e'er her union-crosses sail'd,
But much her arms, her justice more prevail'd!
Her labours are, to plead th' Almighty's cause,
Her pride to teach th' untam'd barbarian laws:
Who conquers wins by brutal strength the prize;
But 'tis a godlike work to civilize.
Have we forgot how from great Russia's throne
The king, whose power half Europe's regions own,
Whose sceptre waving, with one shout rush forth
In swarms the harness'd millions of the north,
Through realms of ice pursued his tedious way
To court our friendship, and our fame survey!
Hence the rich prize of useful arts he bore,
And round his empire spread the learned store:
(T' adorn old realms is more than new to raise,
His country's parent is a monarch's praise.)
His bands now march in just array to war,
And Caspian gulphs unusual navies bear;
With Runick lays Smolensko's forests ring,
And wondering Volga hears the Muses sing.
Did not the painted kings of India greet
Our queen, and lay their sceptres at her feet?
Chiefs who full bowls of hostile blood had quaff'd,
Fam'd for the javelin, and envenom'd shaft,
Whose haughty brows made savages adore,
Nor bow'd to less than stars or sun before.
Her pitying smile accepts their suppliant claim,
And adds four monarchs to the Christian name.
Blest use of power! O virtuous pride in kings!
And like his bounty, whence dominion springs!
Which o'er new worlds makes Heaven's indulgence shine,
And ranges myriads under laws divine!
Well bought with all that those sweet regions hold,
With groves of spices, and with mines of gold.
Fearless our merchant now pursues his gain,
And roams securely o'er the boundless main.
Now o'er his head the polar Bear he spies,
And freezing spangles of the Lapland skies;
Now swells his canvas to the sultry line,
With glittering spoils where Indian grottos shine,
Where fumes of incense glad the southern seas,
And wafted citron scents the balmy breeze.
Here nearer suns prepare the ripening gem,
To grace great Anne's imperial diadem,
And here the ore, whose melted mass shall yield
On faithful coins each memorable field,
Which, mix'd with medals of immortal Rome,
May clear disputes, and teach the times to come.
In circling beams shall godlike Anna glow,
And Churchill's sword hang o'er the prostrate foe;
In comely wounds shall bleeding worthies stand,
Webb's firm platoon, and Lumley's faithful band.
Bold Mordaunt in Iberian trophies drest,
And Campbell's dragon on his dauntless breast,
Great Ormond's deeds on Vigo's spoils enroll'd,
And Guiscard's knife on Harley's Chili gold.
And if the Muse, O Bristol, might decree,
Here Granville noted by the lyre should be,
The lyre for Granville, and the cross for thee.
Such are the honours grateful Britain pays;
So patriots merit, and so monarchs praise.
O'er distant times such records shall prevail,
When English numbers, antiquated, fail:
A trifling song the Muse can only yield,
And sooth her soldiers panting from the field.
To sweet retirements see them safe convey'd,
And raise their battles in the rural shade.
From fields of death to Woodstock's peaceful glooms,
(The poet's haunt) Britannia's hero comes --
Begin my Muse, and softly touch the string:
Here Henry lov'd; and Chaucer learn'd to sing.
Hail, fabled grotto! hail, Elysian soil!
Thou fairest spot of fair Britannia's isle!
Where kings of old, conceal'd, forgot the throne,
And Beauty was content to shine unknown;
Where Love and War by turns pavilions rear,
And Henry's bowers near Blenheim's dome appear;
The weary'd champion lull in soft alcoves,
The noblest boast of thy romantic groves.
Oft, if the Muse presage, shall he be seen
By Rosamonda fleeting o'er the green,
In dreams be hail'd by heroes' mighty shades,
And hear old Chaucer warble through the glades,
O'er the fam'd echoing vaults his name shall bound,
And hill to hill reflect the favourite sound.
Here, here at least thy love for arms give o'er,
Nor, one world conquer'd, fondly wish for more.
Vice of great souls alone! O thirst of fame!
The Muse admires it, while she strives to blame.
Thy toils be now to chase the bounding deer,
Or view the coursers stretch in wild career.
This lovely scene shall sooth thy soul to rest,
And wear each dreadful image from thy breast.
With pleasure, by thy conquests shalt thou see
Thy queen triumphant, and all Europe free.
No cares henceforth shall thy repose destroy,
But what thou giv'st the world, thyself enjoy.
Sweet Solitude! when life's gay hours are past
Howe'er we range, in thee we fix at last:
Tost through tempestuous seas (the voyage o'er)
Pale we look back, and bless thy friendly shore.
Our own strict judges our past life we scan,
And ask if glory hath enlarg'd the span:
If bright the prospect, we the grave defy,
Trust future ages, and contented die.
When strangers from far distant climes shall come,
To view the pomp of this triumphant dome,
Where, rear'd aloft, dissembled trophies stand,
And breathing labours of the sculptor's hand,
Where Kneller's art shall paint the flying Gaul,
And Bourbon's woes shall fill the story'd wall;
Heirs of thy blood shall o'er their bounteous board
Fix Europe's guard, thy monumental sword,
Banners that oft have wav'd on conquer'd walls,
And trumps, that drown'd the groans of gasping Gauls.
Fair dames shall oft, with curious eye, explore
The costly robes that slaughter'd generals wore,
Rich trappings from the Danube's whirlpools brought,
(Hesperian nuns the gorgeous broidery wrought)
Belts stiff with gold, the Boian horseman's pride,
And Gaul's fair flowers, in human crimson dy'd.
Of Churchill's race perhaps some lovely boy
Shall mark the burnish'd steel that hangs on high,
Shall gaze transported on its glittering charms,
And reach it struggling with unequal arms,
By signs the drum's tumultuous sound request,
Then seek, in starts, the hushing mother's breast.
So in the painter's animated frame,
Where Mars embraces the soft Paphian dame,
The little Loves in sport his fauchion wield,
Or join their strength to heave his ponderous shield:
One strokes the plume in Tytion's gore embrued,
And one the spear, that reeks with Typhon's blood:
Another's infant brows the helm sustain,
He nods his crest, and frights the shrieking train.
Thus, the rude tempest of the field o'erblown,
Shall whiter rounds of smiling years roll on,
Our victors, blest in peace, forget their wars,
Enjoy past dangers, and absolve the stars.
But, oh! what sorrows shall bedew your urns,
Ye honour'd shades, whom widow'd Albion mourns!
If your thin forms yet discontented moan,
And haunt the mangled mansions, once your own;
Behold what flowers the pious Muses strow,
And tears, which in the midst of triumph flow;
Cypress and bays your envy'd brows surround,
Your names the tender matron's heart shall wound,
And the soft maid grow pensive at the sound.
Accept, great Anne, the tears their memory draws,
Who nobly perish'd in their sovereign's cause:
For thou in pity bid'st the war give o'er,
Mourn'st thy slain heroes, nor wilt venture more.
Vast price of blood on each victorious day!
(But Europe's freedom doth that price repay.)
Lamented triumphs! when one breath must tell
That Marlborough conquer'd, and that Dormer fell.
Great queen! whose name strikes haughty monarchs pale,
On whose just sceptre hangs Europa's scale,
Whose arm like Mercy wounds, decides like Fate,
On whose decree the nations anxious wait:
From Albion's cliffs thy wide-extended hand
Shall o'er the main to far Peru command;
So vast a tract whose wide domain shall run,
Its circling skies shall see no setting sun.
Thee, thee an hundred languages shall claim,
And savage Indians swear by Anna's name;
The line and poles shall own thy rightful sway,
And thy commands the sever'd globe obey.
Round the vast ball thy new dominions chain
The watery kingdoms, and control the main;
Magellan's straits to Gibraltar they join,
Across the seas a formidable line;
The sight of adverse Gaul we fear no more,
But pleas'd see Dunkirk, now a guiltless shore;
In vain great Neptune tore the narrow ground,
And meant his waters for Britannia's bound;
Her giant genius takes a mighty stride,
And sets his foot beyond the encroaching tide;
On either bank the land its master knows,
And in the midst the subject ocean flows.
So near proud Rhodes, across the raging flood,
Stupendous form! the vast Colossus stood,
(While at one foot their thronging gallies ride,
A whole hour's sail scarce reach the further side)
Betwixt his brazen thighs, in loose array,
Ten thousand streamers on the billows play.
By Harley's counsels, Dunkirk, now restor'd
To Britain's empire, owns her ancient lord,
In him transfus'd his godlike father reigns,
Rich in the blood which swell'd that patriot's veins,
Who, boldly faithful, met his sovereign's frown,
And scorn'd for gold to yield th' important town.
His son was born the ravish'd prey to claim,
And France still trembles at an Harley's name.
A fort so dreadful to our English shore,
Our fleets scarce fear'd the sands or tempests more,
Whose vast expenses to such sums amount,
That the tax'd Gaul scarce furnish'd out th' account,
Whose walls such bulwarks, such vast towers restrain,
Its weakest ramparts are the rocks and main,
His boast great Louis yields, and cheaply buys
Thy friendship, Anna, with the mighty prize.
Holland repining, and in grief cast down,
Sees the new glories of the British crown:
Ah! may they ne'er provoke thee to the fight,
Nor foes, more dreadful than the Gaul, invite.
Soon may they hold the olive, soon asswage
Their secret murmurs, nor call forth thy rage
To rend their banks, and pour, at one command,
Thy realm, the sea, o'er their precarious land.
Henceforth be thine, vice-gerent of the skies,
Scorn'd worth to raise, and vice in robes chastise,
To dry the orphan's tears, and from the bar,
Chace the brib'd judge, and hush the wordy war,
Deny the curst blasphemer's tongue to rage,
And turn God's fury from an impious age.
Blest change! the soldier's late destroying hand
Shall rear new temples in his native land;
Mistaken zealots shall with fear behold,
And beg admittance in our sacred fold;
On her own works the pious queen shall smile,
And turn her cares upon her favourite isle.
So the keen bolt a warrior angel aims,
Array'd in clouds, and wrapt in mantling flames;
He bears a tempest on his sounding wings,
And his red arm the forky vengeance flings;
At length, Heaven's wrath appeas'd, he quits the war,
To roll his orb, and guide his destin'd star,
To shed kind fate, and lucky hours bestow,
And smile propitious on the world below.
Around thy throne shall faithful nobles wait,
These guard the church, and those direct the state.
To Bristol, graceful in maternal tears,
The Church her towery forehead gently rears;
She begs her pious son t' assert her cause
Defend her rights, and reenforce her laws,
With holy zeal the sacred work begin,
To bend the stubborn, and the meek to win.
Our Oxford's earl in careful thought shall stand,
To raise his queen, and save a sinking land.
The wealthiest glebe to ravenous Spaniards known
He marks, and makes the golden world our own,
Content with hands unsoil'd to guard the prize,
And keep the store with undesiring eyes.
So round the tree, that bore Hesperian gold,
The sacred watch lay curl'd in many a fold,
His eyes up-rearing to th' untasted prey,
The sleepless guardian wasted life away.
Beneath the peaceful olives, rais'd by you,
Her ancient pride, shall every art renew,
(The arts with you fam'd Harcourt shall defend,
And courtly Bolingbroke the Muse's friend.)
With piercing eye some search where Nature plays,
And trace the wanton through her darksome maze,
Whence health from herbs; from seeds how groves begun,
How vital streams in circling eddies run.
Some teach why round the Sun the spheres advance,
In the fix'd measures of their mystic dance,
How tides, when heav'd by pressing moons, o'erflow,
And sun-born Iris paints her showery bow,
In happy chains our daring language bound,
Shall sport no more in arbitrary sound,
But buskin'd bards henceforth shall wisely rage,
And Grecian plans reform Britannia's stage:
Till Congreve bids her smile, Augusta stands
And longs to weep when flowing Rowe commands.
Britain's Spectators shall their strength combine
To mend our morals and our taste refine,
Fight virtue's cause, stand up in wit's defence,
Win us from vice, and laugh us into sense.
Nor, Prior, hast thou hush'd the trump in vain,
Thy lyre shall now revive her mirthful strain,
New tales shall now be told; if right I see,
The soul of Chaucer is restor'd in thee.
Garth, in majestic numbers, to the stars
Shall raise mock heroes, and fantastic wars;
Like the young spreading laurel, Pope, thy name
Shoots up with strength, and rises into fame;
With Philips shall the peaceful vallies ring,
And Britain hear a second Spenser sing.
That much-lov'd youth, whom Utrecht's walls confine,
To Bristol's praises shall his Strafford's join:
He too, from whom attentive Oxford draws
Rules for just thinking, and poetic laws,
To growing bards his learned aid shall lend,
The strictest critic, and the kindest friend.
Ev'n mine, a bashful Muse, whose rude essays
Scarce hope for pardon, not aspire to praise,
Cherish'd by you, in time may grow to fame,
And mine survive with Bristol's glorious name.
Fir'd with the views this glittering scene displays,
And smit with passion for my country's praise,
My artless reed attempts this lofty theme,
Where sacred Isis rolls her ancient stream;
In cloister'd domes, the great Philippa's pride,
Where Learning blooms, while Fame and Worth preside,
Where the fifth Henry arts and arms was taught,
And Edward form'd his Cressy, yet unfought,
Where laurel'd bards have struck the warbling strings,
The seat of sages, and the nurse of kings.
Here thy commands, O Lancaster, inflame
My eager breast to raise the British name,
Urge on my soul, with no ignoble pride,
To woo the Muse, whom Addison enjoy'd,
See that bold swan to Heaven sublimely soar,
Pursue at distance, and his steps adore."

821,Emotion,PeacePoemsThePeaceOfDivesPoembyRudyardKipling,"The Word came down to Dives in Torment where he lay:
'Our World is full of wickedness, My Children maim and slay,
'And the Saint and Seer and Prophet
'Can make no better of it
'Than to sanctify and prophesy and pray.
'Rise up, rise up, thou Dives, and take again thy gold,
'And thy women and thy housen as they were to thee of old.
'It may be grace hath found thee
'In the furnace where We bound thee,
'And that thou shalt bring the peace My Son foretold.'
Then merrily rose Dives and leaped from out his fire,
And walked abroad with diligence to do the Lord's desire;
And anon the battles ceased,
And the captives were released,
And Earth had rest from Goshen to Gadire.
The Word came down to Satan that raged and roared alone,
'Mid rhe shouring of the peoples by the cannon overthrown
(But the Prophets, Saints, and Seers
Set each other by the ears,
For each would claim the marvel as his own) :
'Rise up, rise up, thou Satan, upon the Earth to go,
'And prove the Peace of Dives if it be good or no:
'For all that he hath planned
'We deliver to thy hand,
'As thy skill shall serve, to break it or bring low.'
Then mightily rose Satan, and about the Earth he hied,
And breathed on Kings in idleness and Princes drunk with pride.
But for all the wrong he breathed
There was never sword unsheathed,
And the fires he lighted flickered out and died.
Then terribly 'rose Satan, and darkened Earth afar,
Till he came on cunning Dives where the money-changers are;
And he saw men pledge their gear
For the bold that buys the spear,
And the helmet and the habergeon of war.
Yea, to Dives came the Persian and the Syrian and the Mede -
And their hearts were nothing altered, nor their cunning nor their greed -
And they pledged their flocks and farms
For the King-compelling arms,
And Dives lent according to their need.
Then Satan said to Dives: -  'Return again with me,
'Who hast broken His Commandment in the day He set thee free,
'Who grindest for thy greed
'Man's belly-pinch and need,
'And the blood of Man to filthy usury! '
Then softly answered Dives where the money-changers sit: -
'My Refuge is Our Master, O My Master in the Pit.
'But behold all Earth is laid
'In the Peace which I have made,
'And behold I wait on thee to trouble it! '
Then angrily turned Satan, and about the Seas he fled,
To shake the new-sown peoples with insult, doubt, and dread;
But, for all the sleight he used,
There was never squadron loosed,
And the brands he flung flew dying and fell dead.
But to Dives came Atlantis and the Captains of the West -
And their hates were nothing weakened nor their angers unrest -
And they pawned their utmost trade
For the dry, decreeing blade;
And Dives lent and took of them their best.
Then Satan said to Dives: -  'Declare thou by The Name,
'The secret of thy subtlety that turneth mine to shame.
'It is knowvn through all the Hells
'How my peoples mocked my spells,
'And my faithless Kings denied me ere I came.'
Then answvered cunning Dives: 'Do not gold and hate abide
'At the heart of every Magic, yea, and senseless fear beside?
'With gold and fear and hate
'I have harnessed state to state,
'And by hate and fear and gold their hates are tied.
'For hate men seek a weapon, for fear they seek a shield -
'Keener blades and broader targes than their frantic neighbours wield -
'For gold I arm their hands,
'And for gold I buy their lands,
'And for gold I sell their enemies the yield.
'Their nearest foes may purchase, or their furthest friends may lease,
'One by one from Ancient Accad to the Islands of the Seas.
'And their covenants they make
'For the naked iron's sake,
'But I -  I trap them armoured into peace.
'The flocks that Egypt pledged me to Assyria I drave,
'And Pharaoh hath the increase of the herds that Sargon gave.
'Not for Ashdod overthrown
'Will the Kings destroy their own,
'Or their peoples wake the strife they feign to brave.
'Is not Carchemish like Calno? For the steeds of their desire
'They have sold me seven harvests that I sell to Crowning Tyre;
'And the Tyrian sweeps the plains
'With a thousand hired wains,
'And the Cities keep the peace and -  share the hire.
'Hast thou seen the pride of Moab? For the swords about his path,
'His bond is to Philistia, in half of all he hath.
'And he dare not draw the sword
'Till Gaza give the word,
'And he show release from Askalon and Gath.
'Wilt thou call again thy peoples, wilt thou craze anew thy Kings?
'Lo! my lightnings pass before thee, and their whistling servant brings,
'Ere the drowsy street hath stirred,
'Every masked and midnight word,
'And the nations break their fast upon these things.
'So I make a jest of Wonder, and a mock of Time and Space,
'The roofless Seas an hostel, and the Earth a market-place,
'Where the anxious traders know
'Each is surety for his foe,
'And none may thrive without his fellows' grace.
'Now this is all my subtlety and this is all my Wit,
'God give thee good enlightenment. My Master in the Pit.
'But behold all Earth is laid
'In the Peace which I have made,
'And behold I wait on thee to trouble it! '"

A mind-blowing beautiful East West imagery
The central topography high up on the hill
To left and east amazing views, hard wood forests
Mature soaring and stately red maples, buckeyes
Black cherries, silver-bells, pignuts, red oaks, hemlocks
Several hundred feet below a snaking Powell

Monumental Cumberland Mountain Chains in full
View, just over those peaks views of old Kentucky
The peninsular surrounded in Tennessee
Valley Authority’s glistening assignment
Remote, isolated, secluded and gorgeous
Multicolored green quilts lay far out beyond
Revealing one gray and weathered century old barn
A distant farmhouse’s chimney sends out kisses of peace
Amazing graces to our country’s history, Indians
Of past hunted noble buffalo and became
Cast away savages sent away from sacred lands
Fortune seeking immigrants slowly worked bands
Of great covered wagon teams in Westward dreams
An animation filled in spirit and courage
Sometimes catalogued property of Kentucky
Both Grant and Lee captured the Cumberland Gap
Prized the ability to see great distances
Into wilderness, both raw pain and grand beauty
Intermingle in ancient earth, a warriors’ path,
A settler’s hopeful promise, a rich hunting ground,
A perilous place of adventure, a Union’s grace
All steeped in an awe inspiring beauty

Let it not be a death but completeness.
Let love melt into memory and pain
into songs.
Let the flight through the sky end
in the folding of the wings over the

Let the last touch of your hands be

Stand still, O Beautiful End, for a

825,Emotion,PeacePoemsPeaceOrPovertyPoembySonaliShah,"Their skin soaks up the heat
Leaving it as black as the midnight sky,
Their eyes wide, white, pleading
Begging to the passersby.
They litter the street
Half naked bodies,
Red and colouring their feet
Searching for a entrance
A door out of the circle of poverty.
Poverty means destruction
Destruction means fear
Behind locked doors we sit in early evening
Too scared to see a black face
Terrified of black feet crossing the threshold.
But why be fearful of your slaves,
Those you whip and beat
Treating like the dirt from the doormat
Where you wipe your feet.
Role diversity causes poverty
Poverty destroys peace
But peace minus poverty
Means Equality should increase."

And our young men are answering the call.
They are giving their lives for you and for me,
On land, in the air, and out on the sea.
They are brave and strong, and have faith in God.
And are fighting for the land their forefathers trod.
If they can fight for justice and peace.
Let's not let our efforts cease. Let us back home, toil-from light to dark
So our boys, can hit their mark,
This justice and peace, although it is old,
Is a tale that years and centuries unfold.
Our country was founded upon this claim,
And it's our privilege to keep it the same.
This was and conflict, I know will soon end.
For justice and peace; to God are akin."

829,Emotion,PeacePoemsPeaceOnEarthPoembyEdwinArlingtonRobinson,"He took a frayed hat from his head,
And “Peace on Earth” was what he said.
“A morsel out of what you’re worth,
And there we have it: Peace on Earth.
Not much, although a little more
Than what there was on earth before
I’m as you see, I’m Ichabod,—
But never mind the ways I’ve trod;
I’m sober now, so help me God.”
I could not pass the fellow by.
“Do you believe in God?” said I;
“And is there to be Peace on Earth?”
“Tonight we celebrate the birth,”
He said, “of One who died for men;
The Son of God, we say. What then?
Your God, or mine? I’d make you laugh
Were I to tell you even half
That I have learned of mine today
Where yours would hardly seem to stay.
Could He but follow in and out
Some anthropoids I know about,
The god to whom you may have prayed
Might see a world He never made.”
“Your words are flowing full,” said I;
“But yet they give me no reply;
Your fountain might as well be dry.”
“A wiser One than you, my friend,
Would wait and hear me to the end;
And for his eyes a light would shine
Through this unpleasant shell of mine
That in your fancy makes of me
A Christmas curiosity.
All right, I might be worse than that;
And you might now be lying flat;
I might have done it from behind,
And taken what there was to find.
Don’t worry, for I’m not that kind.
‘Do I believe in God?’ Is that
The price tonight of a new hat?
Has he commanded that his name
Be written everywhere the same?
Have all who live in every place
Identified his hidden face?
Who knows but he may like as well
My story as one you may tell?
And if he show me there be Peace
On Earth, as there be fields and trees
Outside a jail-yard, am I wrong
If now I sing him a new song?
Your world is in yourself, my friend,
For your endurance to the end;
And all the Peace there is on Earth
Is faith in what your world is worth,
And saying, without any lies,
Your world could not be otherwise.”
“One might say that and then be shot,”
I told him; and he said: “Why not?”
I ceased, and gave him rather more
Than he was counting of my store.
“And since I have it, thanks to you,
Don’t ask me what I mean to do,”
Said he. “Believe that even I
Would rather tell the truth than lie—
On Christmas Eve. No matter why.”
His unshaved, educated face,
His inextinguishable grace.
And his hard smile, are with me still,
Deplore the vision as I will;
For whatsoever he be at,
So droll a derelict as that
Should have at least another hat."
830,Emotion,PeacePoemsPeacePoembyFlorenceMJones,"Peace is letting life's cares
Roll over your head while
Stamping on them with both feet.
It is daily maintaining control
Of the body, mind and soul.
Peace is steering away from snares
And not taking on life's gloomy cares.
It is being like falling snowflakes
Wonderfully resting serenely as you
Lie on your bed when sick or well.
Peace is letting God have complete control
Of troubles, misery and gloom.
Peace never entertains sorrow
But firmly grips hope for each tomorrow.
Sometimes, peace says speak.
Frequently, peace says be silent.
Peace dwells deep within you and me
Where no mortal being can reach.
Peace cries, ""Never let me go
For I am yours to forever keep."""
831,Emotion,PeacePoemsThePeacePipePoembyHenryWadsworthLongfellow,"On the Mountains of the Prairie,
On the great Red Pipe-stone Quarry,
Gitche Manito, the mighty,
He the Master of Life, descending,
On the red crags of the quarry
Stood erect, and called the nations,
Called the tribes of men together.
From his footprints flowed a river,
Leaped into the light of morning,
O'er the precipice plunging downward
Gleamed like Ishkoodah, the comet.
And the Spirit, stooping earthward,
With his finger on the meadow
Traced a winding pathway for it,
Saying to it, ""Run in this way!""
From the red stone of the quarry
With his hand he broke a fragment,
Moulded it into a pipe-head,
Shaped and fashioned it with figures;
From the margin of the river
Took a long reed for a pipe-stem,
With its dark green leaves upon it;
Filled the pipe with bark of willow,
With the bark of the red willow;
Breathed upon the neighboring forest,
Made its great boughs chafe together,
Till in flame they burst and kindled;
And erect upon the mountains,
Gitche Manito, the mighty,
Smoked the calumet, the Peace-Pipe,
As a signal to the nations.
And the smoke rose slowly, slowly,
Through the tranquil air of morning,
First a single line of darkness,
Then a denser, bluer vapor,
Then a snow-white cloud unfolding,
Like the tree-tops of the forest,
Ever rising, rising, rising,
Till it touched the top of heaven,
Till it broke against the heaven,
And rolled outward all around it.
From the Vale of Tawasentha,
From the Valley of Wyoming,
From the groves of Tuscaloosa,
From the far-off Rocky Mountains,
From the Northern lakes and rivers
All the tribes beheld the signal,
Saw the distant smoke ascending,
The Pukwana of the Peace-Pipe.
And the Prophets of the nations
Said: ""Behold it, the Pukwana!
By the signal of the Peace-Pipe,
Bending like a wand of willow,
Waving like a hand that beckons,
Gitche Manito, the mighty,
Calls the tribes of men together,
Calls the warriors to his council!""
Down the rivers, o'er the prairies,
Came the warriors of the nations,
Came the Delawares and Mohawks,
Came the Choctaws and Camanches,
Came the Shoshonies and Blackfeet,
Came the Pawnees and Omahas,
Came the Mandans and Dacotahs,
Came the Hurons and Ojibways,
All the warriors drawn together
By the signal of the Peace-Pipe,
To the Mountains of the Prairie,
To the great Red Pipe-stone Quarry,
And they stood there on the meadow,
With their weapons and their war-gear,
Painted like the leaves of Autumn,
Painted like the sky of morning,
Wildly glaring at each other;
In their faces stem defiance,
In their hearts the feuds of ages,
The hereditary hatred,
The ancestral thirst of vengeance.
Gitche Manito, the mighty,
The creator of the nations,
Looked upon them with compassion,
With paternal love and pity;
Looked upon their wrath and wrangling
But as quarrels among children,
But as feuds and fights of children!
Over them he stretched his right hand,
To subdue their stubborn natures,
To allay their thirst and fever,
By the shadow of his right hand;
Spake to them with voice majestic
As the sound of far-off waters,
Falling into deep abysses,
Warning, chiding, spake in this wise :
""O my children! my poor children!
Listen to the words of wisdom,
Listen to the words of warning,
From the lips of the Great Spirit,
From the Master of Life, who made you!
""I have given you lands to hunt in,
I have given you streams to fish in,
I have given you bear and bison,
I have given you roe and reindeer,
I have given you brant and beaver,
Filled the marshes full of wild-fowl,
Filled the rivers full of fishes:
Why then are you not contented?
Why then will you hunt each other?
""I am weary of your quarrels,
Weary of your wars and bloodshed,
Weary of your prayers for vengeance,
Of your wranglings and dissensions;
All your strength is in your union,
All your danger is in discord;
Therefore be at peace henceforward,
And as brothers live together.
""I will send a Prophet to you,
A Deliverer of the nations,
Who shall guide you and shall teach you,
Who shall toil and suffer with you.
If you listen to his counsels,
You will multiply and prosper;
If his warnings pass unheeded,
You will fade away and perish!
""Bathe now in the stream before you,
Wash the war-paint from your faces,
Wash the blood-stains from your fingers,
Bury your war-clubs and your weapons,
Break the red stone from this quarry,
Mould and make it into Peace-Pipes,
Take the reeds that grow beside you,
Deck them with your brightest feathers,
Smoke the calumet together,
And as brothers live henceforward!""
Then upon the ground the warriors
Threw their cloaks and shirts of deer-skin,
Threw their weapons and their war-gear,
Leaped into the rushing river,
Washed the war-paint from their faces.
Clear above them flowed the water,
Clear and limpid from the footprints
Of the Master of Life descending;
Dark below them flowed the water,
Soiled and stained with streaks of crimson,
As if blood were mingled with it!
From the river came the warriors,
Clean and washed from all their war-paint;
On the banks their clubs they buried,
Buried all their warlike weapons.
Gitche Manito, the mighty,
The Great Spirit, the creator,
Smiled upon his helpless children!
And in silence all the warriors
Broke the red stone of the quarry,
Smoothed and formed it into Peace-Pipes,
Broke the long reeds by the river,
Decked them with their brightest feathers,
And departed each one homeward,
While the Master of Life, ascending,
Through the opening of cloud-curtains,
Through the doorways of the heaven,
Vanished from before their faces,
In the smoke that rolled around him,
The Pukwana of the Peace-Pipe!"
832,Emotion,PeacePoemsPromiseOfPeacePoembyRobinsonJeffers,"The heads of strong old age are beautiful
Beyond all grace of youth. They have strange quiet,
Integrity, health, soundness, to the full
They've dealt with life and been tempered by it.
A young man must not sleep; his years are war,
Civil and foreign but the former's worse;
But the old can breathe in safety now that they are
Forgetting what youth meant, the being perverse,
Running the fool's gauntlet and being cut
By the whips of the five senses. As for me,
If I should wish to live long it were but
To trade those fevers for tranquillity,
Thinking though that's entire and sweet in the grave
How shall the dead taste the deep treasure they have?"
833,Emotion,PeacePoemsNotPeaceButASwordPoembyBobGotti,"On the scene came Christ The Lord, not with peace but with a sword.
The sword was The Word of Truth, and to many it became a reproof.
To many hearts Truth would come, to acknowledge God’s Only Son.
But many just wouldn’t believe, and The Truth they would not receive.
For many tradition plays a part, following old ways that sway the heart.
Christ came with the New Covenant, fulfilling the Word prophets sent.
But many men would only dispute, Christ’s teaching on Eternal Truth.
His teaching would have men opposed, to others in their own homes.
A father would oppose his own son, about Christ Jesus being the One,
Who was sent from God above, sent to demonstrate His Father’s Love.
A man’s daughter would cause strife, as she too would oppose his wife.
She also would contest the life, which men would found through Christ.
Truth alone as one’s ultimate source, was for many the dividing force.
Many would turn away from Christ, while they embrace this earthly life.
While others would find true unity, through Christ’s teaching on Eternity.
And Jesus is The Prince of Peace, whose Eternal reign will never cease.
Today He reigns in the heart of men, who through faith are Born Again.
Born Again through The Spirit above, who by faith receive God’s Love.
And today if you embrace your sin, you too, will stand opposed to Him.
But you don’t have to fear the sword, if you will accept Christ as Lord.

834,Emotion,PeacePoemsPeaceAfterAStormPoembyWilliamCowper,"When darkness long has veil'd my mind,
And smiling day once more appears,
Then, my Redeemer, then I find
The folly of my doubts and fears.
Straight I upbraid my wandering heart,
And blush that I should ever be
Thus prone to act so base a part,
Or harbour one hard thought of Thee!
Oh! let me then at length be taught
What I am still so slow to learn,
That God is love, and changes not,
Nor knows the shadow of a turn.
Sweet truth, and easy to repeat!
But when my faith is sharply tried,
I find myself a learner yet,
Unskilful, weak, and apt to slide.
But, O my Lord, one look from Thee
Subdues the disobedient will,
Drives doubt and discontent away,
And Thy rebellious worm is still.
Thou art as ready to forgive
As I am ready to repine;
Thou, therefore, all the praise receive;
Be shame and self-abhorrence mine."

Before I even sleep tonight.
I'm plagued by many torments,
All trying to stop me write.
It's death by a thousand cuts,
By many constant interruptions.
The telephone, that noisy car,
And countless other disruptions.
I should dwell in a cave,
To find some perfect peace.
There to write in solitude,
Where every noise does cease.
But the way my luck is going,
I simply haven't got a prayer.
I know as soon as I arrive,
A brass band awaits me there."
837,Emotion,PeacePoemsPeacePeacePeacePoembyViolaBJelinek,"In the Bible-God says, let there
be peace among all nations.
Peace is something to cherish
and behold...whether in heart
or in soul; peace in Spirit, and in
mind...gives us the feelings to be kind
Peace among group's ...minority, black
and white...leads us to do what's right
Peace in our cities, homes, and towns
is what we all need...if it can be found
Peace in the world...among all Nations,
is just what we need for self presentation.
Peace in our lives, with family and friends
Will help make us all ready... when God descends
But there can be no peace, without,
""God's intervention"", so let us all
""Accept Him, "" and have a world convention."

Is growing over the stones in quiet hollows
And the cocksfoot leans across the rutted cart-pass
That I am not the voice of country fellows
Who now are standing by some headland talking
Of turnips and potatoes or young corn
Of turf banks stripped for victory.
Here Peace is still hawking
His coloured combs and scarves and beads of horn.
Upon a headland by a whinny hedge
A hare sits looking down a leaf-lapped furrow
There's an old plough upside-down on a weedy ridge
And someone is shouldering home a saddle-harrow.
Out of that childhood country what fools climb
To fight with tyrants Love and Life and Time?"

Millstone remained that still turned).
Oh, the land torn like clothes
That can't be mended.
Hard, lonely fathers even in the cave of the Makhpela*
Childless silence.
My child wafts peace.
His mother's womb promised him
What God cannot
Promise us.

840,Emotion,PeacePoemsPeaceAStudyPoembyCharlesStuartCalverley,"He stood, a worn-out City clerk —
Who'd toil'd, and seen no holiday,
For forty years from dawn to dark —
Alone beside Caermarthen Bay.
He felt the salt spray on his lips;
Heard children's voices on the sands;
Up the sun's path he saw the ships
Sail on and on to other lands;
And laugh'd aloud. Each sight and sound
To him was joy too deep for tears;
He sat him on the beach, and bound
A blue bandana round his ears
And thought how, posted near his door,
His own green door on Camden Hill,
Two bands at least, most likely more,
Were mingling at their own sweet will
Verdi with Vance. And at the thought
He laugh'd again, and softly drew
That Morning Herald that he'd bought
Forth from his breast, and read it through."
841,Emotion,PeacePoemsMyDreamAVisionOfPeacePoembyToddMichaelStPierre,"Where the mountains touch the sky,
Where poets DREAM, where eagles fly,
A secret place above the crowd,
Just beneath a silver-lined cloud.
Lift your eyes to a snowy peak,
And see the soon-to-be we seek.
Whisper DREAMS and let them rise,
To the mountains old and wise.
Climbers climb, it's time to try,
Where the mountains touch the sky.
Take me there. Oh take me now,
Someway, Someday, Somewhere, Somehow.
Where the ocean meets the sky,
Where mermaid dance, where seagulls fly,
A place in DREAMS I know so well,
The sea inside a single shell.
Far across the living sea,
A pale blue possibility,
Beyond the castles made of sand,
Tomorrow in a small child's hand.
Only DREAMERS need apply,
Where the ocean meets the sky.
Take me there. Oh take me now,
Someway, Someday, Somewhere, Somehow.
A common ground for one and all,
Behind the crystal waterfall,
Where Peace flows like a mighty stream,
Like Dr. King I have a DREAM.
Imagine such a goal in sight,
For red and yellow, black and white…
New Delhi, Beijing, Kenya, Rome,
Earth is the place that we call home.
Baghdad, Belfast, Tel Aviv,
One race HUMAN, we still believe,
Come DREAM with me...
Where the forests reach the sky,
Wake to DREAMS, and don’t be shy.
We’ll DREAM the world a thorn-less rose;
We’ll plant then watch it as it grows.
We’ll conquer hate with DREAMS of hope,
We’ll DREAM one big kaleidoscope.
Whisper now; let the DREAM begin,
It's time to trust the truth within.
This is where we seek and find…
A place called PEACE for humankind.
DREAM on DREAMERS, hopes are high,
Where the forests reach the sky.
Take me there. Oh take me now,
Someway, Someday, Somewhere, Somehow.
Now, listen close, the future calls...
'Build your bridges and tear down walls! '
For time has taught and so it seems,
Realities are born of DREAMS!
Whisper DREAMS and let them rise,
To the mountains old and wise."

Hear what God the Lord hath spoken,
""O my people, faint and few,
Comfortless, afflicted, broken,
Fair abodes I build for you.
Thorns of heartfelt tribulation
Shall no more perplex your ways;
You shall name your walls, Salvation,
And your gates shall all be Praise.
""There, like streams that feed the garden,
Pleasures without end shall flow,
For the Lord, your faith rewarding,
All His bounty shall bestow;
Still in undisturb'd possession
Peace and righteousness shall reign;
Never shall you feel oppression,
Hear the voice of war again.
""Ye no more your suns descending,
Waning moons no more shall see;
But your griefs forever ending,
Find eternal noon in me:
God shall rise, and shining o'er ye,
Change to day the gloom of night;
He, the Lord, shall be your glory,
God your everlasting light."""
843,Emotion,PeacePoemsPeaceCanBeFoundInTheStormPoembyBeckyLaPrarie,"You think you hurt and that life has treated you so unkindly
Friend let me tell you about someone who endured so much more
He endured more than any human upon this earth has before
He was laughed at and mocked by those whom he loved
He was wounded for our sins as well
By those whom he taught about God and good
His whereabouts to the enemies they still did tell
He was spat upon lashed, beaten beyond belief
Nowhere upon earth did his body find relief
His own mother watched him die
All sh could do was watch them torture him
Her son as she winced in pain on his behalf
“Oh how she did cry”!
He was torn, and tattered, beaten and scorned
Yet I am sure he hurt more for the hearts
That were broken and for all who for his death, mourned
He took so little for himself, for he came as a servant to all
And not once as he hang upon the cross suffering
Upon his many angels for help did he call!
So unworthy are we still of his life he gave for all
Don’t look back at who has hurt you the most
Or what is not right in your lives
For if Jesus hadn’t died for us-
Friend, you wouldn’t have a life at all!

845,Emotion,PeacePoemsAnAngryPoemAboutPeacePoembyMichaelShepherd,"This is an angry poem.
About those weasel phrases
which blow like paper in the street
going nowhere,
hiding truth,
helping us to
deceive ourselves.
'The pee-yus pro-sayus' -
say it in the Irish voice
of obscurantist politicians
often enough
and we'll accept it as a term,
and believe that it needs hard work
and forward planning
and careful progress
and compromise
and agreements
and initiatives
and 'generous' concessions
and declarations of intention
and cautious examination
of opponents' motives
in the 'battle' for peace
and coming together
to establish differences...
Peace
is what is eternally there
when war and strife is absent.
Eternally.
I can't remember Christ
(was he Catholic or Protestant? I just can't remember...)
saying
'Peace process be unto you'...
uh, when would that be? ...
or commanding the waves of the Sea of Galilee
'Engage in the peace process - be still'...
somehow it just doesn't seem to carry weight
as a blessing or a do-it-now...
'Go in process towards peace, my child...'
I wonder why that is."
846,Emotion,PeacePoemsPeaceXviiiPoembyKhalilGibran,"The tempest calmed after bending the branches of the trees and leaning heavily upon the grain in the field. The stars appeared as broken remnants of lightning, but now silence prevailed over all, as if Nature's war had never been fought.
At that hour a young woman entered her chamber and knelt by her bed sobbing bitterly. Her heart flamed with agony but she could finally open her lips and say, ""Oh Lord, bring him home safely to me. I have exhausted my tears and can offer no more, oh Lord, full of love and mercy. My patience is drained and calamity is seeking possession of my heart. Save him, oh Lord, from the iron paws of War; deliver him from such unmerciful Death, for he is weak, governed by the strong. Oh Lord, save my beloved, who is Thine own son, from the foe, who is Thy foe. Keep him from the forced pathway to Death's door; let him see me, or come and take me to him.""
Quietly a young man entered. His head was wrapped in bandage soaked with escaping life.
He approached he with a greeting of tears and laughter, then took her hand and placed against it his flaming lips. And with a voice with bespoke past sorrow, and joy of union, and uncertainty of her reaction, he said, ""Fear me not, for I am the object of your plea. Be glad, for Peace has carried me back safely to you, and humanity has restored what greed essayed to take from us. Be not sad, but smile, my beloved. Do not express bewilderment, for Love has power that dispels Death; charm that conquers the enemy. I am your one. Think me not a specter emerging from the House of Death to visit your Home of Beauty.
""Do not be frightened, for I am now Truth, spared from swords and fire to reveal to the people the triumph of Love over War. I am Word uttering introduction to the play of happiness and peace.""
Then the young man became speechless and his tears spoke the language of the heart; and the angels of Joy hovered about that dwelling, and the two hearts restored the singleness which had been taken from them.
At dawn the two stood in the middle of the field contemplating the beauty of Nature injured by the tempest. After a deep and comforting silence, the soldier said to his sweetheart, ""Look at the Darkness, giving birth to the Sun."""

If hatred and hostilities among nations don't cease.

The envelope of earth was powder loud;
The taut wings shivered, driven at the sun.
The piper put his pipe away and bowed.
Not here, he said. I hunt the love-cool one,
The dancer with the clipped hair. Where is she?
We shook our heads, parting for him to pass.
Our lady was of no such trim degree,
And none of us had seen her face, alas.
She was the very ridges that we must scale,
Securing the rough top. And how she smiled
Was how our strength would issue. Not to fail
Was having her, gigantic, undefiled,
For homely goddess, big as the world that burned,
Grandmother and taskmistress, frild and town.
We let the stranger go; but when we turned
Our lady lived, fierce in each other's frown."
855,Emotion,PeacePoemsToMyBrotherPoetSeekingPeacePoembyEricaJong,"People wish to be settled. Only as long as they are unsettled is there any hope for them.
-- Thoreau
My life has been
the instrument
for a mouth
I have never seen,
breathing wind
which comes
from I know not
where,
arranging and changing
my moods,
so as to make
an opening
for his voice.
Or hers.
Muse, White Goddess
mother with invisible
milk,
androgynous god
in whose grip
I struggle,
turning this way and that,
believing that I chart
my life,
my loves,
when in fact
it is she, he,
who charts them--
all for the sake
of some
as yet unwritten poem.
Twisting in the wind,
twisting like a pirate
dangling in a cage
from a high seawall,
the wind whips
through my bones
making an instrument,
my back a xylophone,
my sex a triangle
chiming,
my lips stretched tight
as drumskins,
I no longer care
who is playing me,
but fear
makes the hairs
stand up
on the backs
of my hands
when I think
that she may stop.
And yet I long
for peace
as fervently as you do--
the sweet connubial bliss
that admits no
turbulence,
the settled life
that defeats poetry,
the hearth before which
children play--
not poets' children,
ragtag, neurotic, demon-ridden,
but the apple-cheeked children
of the bourgeoisie.
My daughter dreams
of peace
as I do:
marriage, proper house,
proper husband,
nourishing dreamless
sex,
love like a hot toddy,
or an apple pie.
But the muse
has other plans
for me
and you.
Puppet mistress,
dangling us
on this dark proscenium,
pulling our strings,
blowing us
toward Cornwall,
toward Venice, toward Delphi,
toward some lurching
counterpane,
a tent upheld
by one throbbing
blood-drenched pole--
her pen, her pencil,
the monolith
we worship,
underneath
the gleaming moon."

Your round me roaming end, and under be my boughs?
When, when, Peace, will you, Peace? I’ll not play hypocrite
To own my heart: I yield you do come sometimes; but
That piecemeal peace is poor peace. What pure peace allows
Alarms of wars, the daunting wars, the death of it?
O surely, reaving Peace, my Lord should leave in lieu
Some good! And so he does leave Patience exquisite,
That plumes to Peace thereafter. And when Peace here does house
He comes with work to do, he does not come to coo,
He comes to brood and sit."

As the tide to the pool by the shore;
It is mine forevermore,
It ebbs not back like the sea.
I am the pool of blue

My hopes were heaven-high,
They are all fulfilled in you.
I am the pool of gold
When sunset burns and dies--
You are my deepening skies,
Give me your stars to hold."

863,Emotion,PeacePoemsASenseOfPeacePoembyErnestineNorthover,"How clear is the air found at a mountain's top,
And breathing this freshness, clarifies all things,
At such high altitude, oxygen can drop,
Then movement slow's, but thoughts fly swift on wings,
Letting the new adventurer explore,
A world that opens wide its magic doors.
Land of peak and valley, sea and shore.
Viewing all this, one's heart pulsates and soars,
Then a sense of peace, envelops the inner soul,
And lightness pervades, where heaviness has been,
Lifting the senses, raising them as a whole,
Introducing pure quietness, making one's life serene.

864,Emotion,PeacePoemsPeaceLittleGirlPeacePoembyMiaOcean,"The poor young girl
with beach blonde hair
and pale white skin
stands in the middle of the street,
in the middle of a war.
Her face shows pain,
her face shows she wants help.
She goes to the hardware store
and steals a can of purple paint.
She doesn't know better,
so it doesn't matter.
The pale girl opens the can of purple paint
and uses her hands to write a message on the
big brick building wall.
She uses what knowledge she has of spelling,
and traces her purple paint covered fingers
over the wall.
First she draws a P
than an E
than she dips her hand back in the paint.
When she is done with the word,
the purple paint has run down the wall,
but you could still see the word very clearly.
It spelled PEACE.
The young girl takes her hand and presses it to the wall
leaving a very small purple handprint.
Then she runs.
A soldier calls after her,
'Peace little girl, Peace! '"
865,Emotion,PeacePoemsLoveJoyPeaceAndPresencePoembyChristianEliabRatnam,"My love for you,
How rich in depth?
For joy to cherish,
For peace to restore,
For presence to make known,
My love to engulf!
Fireworks on candles,
Roses embedded beneath.
For love so pure,
For joy to rejoice,
For peace to uphold,
For presence to overwhelm,
My love to sparkle!
Lilies on a river,
Chandelier on the sky.
For love so innocent,
For joy to compel,
For peace to touch,
For presence to gaze,
My love till death will reign!"
866,Emotion,PeacePoemsPeaceBlessedPeacePoembyEdwardGeorgeDyson,"Here in the flamin' thick of thick of things,
With Death across the way, 'n' traps
What little Fritz the German flings
Explodin' in yer lunch pe'aps,
It ain't all glory for a bloke',
It ain't all corfee 'ot and stoo,
Nor wavin' banners in the smoke,
Or practisin' the bay'net stroke—
We has our little troubles, too!
Here's Trigger Ribb bin seein' red
'N' raisin' Cain because he had,
Back in the caverns iv his 'ead,
A 'oller tooth run ravin' mad.
Pore Trigger up 'n' down the trench
Was jiggin' like a blithered loan,
'N' every time she give a wrench
You orter seen the beggar blench,
You orter 'eard him play a toon.
The sullen shells was pawin' blind,
A-feelin' for us grim as sin,
While now 'n' then we'd likely find
A dizzy bomb come limpin' in.
But Trigger simply let 'er sizz.
He 'ardly begged to be excused.
This was no damn concern of his.
He twined a muffler round his phiz,
'N' fearful was the words he used.
Lest we be getting' cock-a-whoop
Ole 'Ans tries out his box of tricks.
His bullets all around the coop
Is peckin' like a million chicks.
But Trigger when they barks his snout
Don't sniff at it. He won't confess
They're on the earth—ignores the clout,
'N' makes the same old sung about
His brimmin' mug of bitterness.
They raided us there in the mud
One day afore the dead sun rose.
Me oath, the mess of stuff and blood
Would give a slaughterman the joes!
And when the scrap is past and done,
Where's Trigger Ribb? The noble youth
Has got his bay'net in a Hun,
While down his cheeks the salt tears run.
Sez he to me “Gorbli'—this tooth!”
A shell hoist Trigger in a tree.
We found him motherin' his jor.
“If this ache's goin' on,” sez he,
“So 'elp me, it'll spoil the war!”
Five collared Trigger on his perch,
They wired his molar to a bough,
Then give the anguished one a lurch,
'N' down he pitches. From that birch
His riddled tooth is hangin' now.
This afternoon it's merry 'ell;
Grenades is comin' by the peck;
A big gun times us true 'n well,
And, oh! we gets it in the neck.
They lick out flames hat reach a mile,
The drip of lead will never cease.
But Trigger's pottin' all the while;
He sports a fond 'n' foolish smile-
“Thank Gord,” he sez, “a bit of peace!”"
867,Emotion,PeacePoemsTheRoseOfPeacePoembyWilliamButlerYeats,"IF Michael, leader of God's host
When Heaven and Hell are met,
Looked down on you from Heaven's door-post
He would his deeds forget.
Brooding no more upon God's wars
In his divine homestead,
He would go weave out of the stars
A chaplet for your head.
And all folk seeing him bow down,
And white stars tell your praise,
Would come at last to God's great town,
Led on by gentle ways;
And God would bid His warfare cease,
Saying all things were well;
And softly make a rosy peace,
A peace of Heaven with Hell."
868,Emotion,PeacePoemsPeaceRestoredPoembyJamesShirley,"You virgins, that did late despair
To keep your wealth from cruel men,
Tie up in silk your careless hair:
Soft peace is come again.
Now lovers' eyes may gently shoot
A flame that will not kill;
The drum was angry, but the lute
Shall whisper what you will.
Sing Io, Io! for his sake
That hath restored your drooping heads;
With choice of sweetest flowers make
A garden where he treads;
Whilst we whole groves of laurel bring,
A petty triumph for his brow,
Who is the master of our spring
And all the bloom we owe."

By using alcohol and other drugs.

Do not let them prey on you!
Knock them out of your life forever,
And begin to start your life anew!"
870,Emotion,PeacePoemsMondayNightMay11th1846DomesticPeacePoembyAnneBrontë,"Why should such gloomy silence reign;
And why is all the house so drear,
When neither danger, sickness, pain,
Nor death, nor want have entered here?
We are as many as we were
That other night, when all were gay,
And full of hope, and free from care;
Yet, is there something gone away.
The moon without as pure and calm
Is shining as that night she shone;
but now, to us she brings no balm,
For something from our hearts is gone.
Something whose absence leaves a void,
A cheerless want in every heart.
Each feels the bliss of all destroyed
And mourns the change - but each apart.
The fire is burning in the grate
As redly as it used to burn,
But still the hearth is desolate
Till Mirth and Love with Peace return.
'Twas Peace that flowed from heart to heart
With looks and smiles that spoke of Heaven,
And gave us language to impart
The blissful thoughts itself had given.
Sweet child of Heaven, and joy of earth!
O, when will Man thy value learn?
We rudely drove thee from our hearth,
And vainly sigh for thy return."

To gird us for the sun,
What gaze!
When from a thousand skies
On our developed eyes
Noons blaze!"
872,Emotion,PeacePoemsAtPeacePoembyTatiannaReiMoonshadow,"That night I laid beside you
With one hand upon your heart
It beat ever so gently
As we laid there in the dark
For hours we spoke
Only with honesty and truth
Somewhere between our words
I fell in love with you
We spoke in quiet whispers
Careful not to wake our friends
As they slept we had conversation
That seemed to know no end
You told me of your weakness
Of your fears and your past
I shared with you the stories
Of the loves that could not last
For once I was contempt
Just to have someone there
Somehow in that conversation
I let myself open up and care
My heart ceased it's breaking
And my mind laid to rest
Your eyes brought me smiles
While your heartbeat eased my breath
For the first time I was happy
Happy to have someone to hold
As I wrapped you tight in my arms
To shield you from the cold
As the sun began to rise
In the window it shined through
You pulled me ever closer
And I fell asleep, At Peace, with you"

Crossing far galaxy you come,
You adore and you sing for all,

Like the dawn that will come,
Tomorrow will shine with joy.

Like the smile of edentulous sun,
Let sun sleep to wake up tomorrow,
Let sun reborn as child once more,
Let sky crawl in middle of galaxy,
But you swim and run and come soon.
To welcome you, we are waiting here,
We are dreaming whole day and night,
Covering the veil of love you smile,
Peace you peace us by your power.

The wetness of flora brings me cool breeze.
I was born in this universe with peaceful nature around me
Then, I always felt that I was a star on my own brightness.
Learned, the love and kindness brings me a peace of mind
Learned, the prayers for God brings me a peace of mind

Children playing in the street.

Atonement with the great I Am.
Lion resting with a lamb.
World leaders shaking hands—

To minimize potential lost.

Would bring the world much relief.
May strife and fighting ever cease
And “true” peace be increased.

878,Emotion,PeacePoemsPeacePoembyGeorgeHerbert,"Sweet Peace, where dost thou dwell? I humbly crave,
Let me once know.
I sought thee in a secret cave,
And ask'd, if Peace were there,
A hollow wind did seem to answer, No:
Go seek elsewhere.
I did; and going did a rainbow note:
Surely, thought I,
This is the lace of Peace's coat:
I will search out the matter.
But while I looked the clouds immediately
Did break and scatter.
Then went I to a garden and did spy
A gallant flower,
The crown-imperial: Sure, said I,
Peace at the root must dwell.
But when I digged, I saw a worm devour
What showed so well.
At length I met a rev'rend good old man;
Whom when for Peace
I did demand, he thus began:
There was a Prince of old
At Salem dwelt, who lived with good increase
Of flock and fold.
He sweetly lived; yet sweetness did not save
His life from foes.
But after death out of his grave
There sprang twelve stalks of wheat;
Which many wond'ring at, got some of those
To plant and set.
It prospered strangely, and did soon disperse
Through all the earth:
For they that taste it do rehearse
That virtue lies therein;
A secret virtue, bringing peace and mirth
By flight of sin.
Take of this grain, which in my garden grows,
And grows for you;
Make bread of it: and that repose
And peace, which ev'ry where
With so much earnestness you do pursue,
Is only there."
879,Emotion,PeacePoemsWarAndPeacePoembyNateSnowball,"War is Peace
Peace is War
War unites against
One common enemy
Peace tears apart

Gives control to the government

Physically, Statistically
Peace ends life
Emotionally, Personally
War is Peace
Peace is War"

Peace is a not a mere  humming song.
Peace is my  lovely girl

She is a  star that I can see here
I know you are   there, somewhere here
I’ll not  miss you  this curly hair
I’ll not want to  miss  the smell of  this beloved…..
I know you’ll come back some day
I’m praying that you  are   there, somewhere here
Hope you remember me appaling  again….
I’ll not  miss this purple lintel
I’ ll  not kiss this  lovely lint
Peace is not   really a  gossip
Peace is  not a mere hand on her purple  gown.
Peace is not a gypsy affair.

You falling  me back  again
The star that I can see in this soaring  altar
This star  I can see in a  dashed  anchor....
Hope you remember me again and again"
881,Emotion,PeacePoemsTheHomeOfPeacePoembyCharlesHarpur,"Trust and treachery, wisdom, folly,
Madness, mirth and melancholy,
Love and hatred, thrift and pillage,
All are housed in every village.
And in such a world’s mixed being,
Where may peace, from ruin fleeing,
Find fit shelter and inherit
All the calm of her own merit?
In a bark of gentle motion
Sailing on the summer ocean?
There worst war the tempest wages,
And the hungry whirlpool rages.
In some lonely new-world bower
Hidden like a forest flower?
There, too, there, to fray the stranger
Stalks the wild-eyed savage, danger!
In some Alpine cot, by fountains
Flowing from snow-shining mountains?
There the avalanches thunder,
Crushing all that lieth under!
In some hermit-tent, pitched lowly
Mid the tombs of prophets holy?
There to harry and annoy her
Roams the infidel destroyer.
In palatial chambers gilded,
Guarded round with towers high-builded?
Change may enter these to-morrow,
And with change may enter sorrow.
Find, O peace, thy home of beauty
In the steadfast heart of duty,
Dwelling ever there, and seeing
God through every phase of being"

Their hoofs heavy with tumult, their eyes glimmering white;
The North unfolds above them clinging, creeping night,
The East her hidden joy before the morning break,
The West weeps in pale dew and sighs passing away,
The South is pouring down roses of crimson fire:
O vanity of Sleep, Hope, Dream, endless Desire,
The Horses of Disaster plunge in the heavy clay:
Beloved, let your eyes half close, and your heart beat
Over my heart, and your hair fall over my breast,
Drowning love's lonely hour in deep twilight of rest,
And hiding their tossing manes and their tumultuous feet."

Peace in lands where fields are bright.
Peace in lands of oasis and sand,
Peace in lands where people band,
Peace in lands where children play,
Peace in lands where people pray,
Peace in lands in the thick of the fight,
Peace in lands ruled by force and might.
Everywhere, everywhere, peace this day!
Pray that all world leaders lead the way,
Encouraging moral people to stand proud and tall,
No government too great, no nation too small."

IN EXCELSIS
Two dwellings, Peace, are thine.
One is the mountain-height,
Uplifted in the loneliness of light
Beyond the realm of shadows,- fine,
And far, and clear,- where advent of the night
Means only glorious nearness of the stars,
And dawn, unhindered, breaks above the bars
That long the lower world in twilight keep.
Thou sleepest not, and hast no need of sleep,
For all thy cares and fears have dropped away;
The night's fatigue, the fever-fret of day,
Are far below thee; and earth's weary wars,
In vain expense of passion, pass
Before thy sight like visions in a glass,
Or like the wrinkles of the storm that creep
Across the sea and leave no trace
Of trouble on that immemorial face,-
So brief appear the conflicts, and so slight
The wounds men give, the things for which they fight.
Here hangs a fortress on the distant steep,-
A lichen clinging to the rock:
There sails a fleet upon the deep,-
A wandering flock
Of snow-winged gulls: and yonder, in the plain,
A marble palace shines,- a grain
Of mica glittering in the rain.
Beneath thy feet the clouds are rolled
By voiceless winds: and far between
The rolling clouds new shores and peaks are seen,
In shimmering robes of green and gold,
And faint aerial hue
That silent fades into the silent blue.
Thou, from thy mountain-hold,
All day, in tranquil wisdom, looking down
On distant scenes of human toil and strife,
All night, with eyes aware of loftier life,
Uplooking to the sky, where stars are sown,
Dost watch the everlasting fields grow white
Unto the harvest of the sons of light,
And welcome to thy dwelling-place sublime
The few strong souls that dare to climb
The slippery crags and find thee on the height.
II
DE PROFUNDIS
But in the depth thou hast another home,
For hearts less daring, or more frail.
Thou dwellest also in the shadowy vale;
And pilgrim-souls that roam
With weary feet o'er hill and dale,
Bearing the burden and the heat
Of toilful days,
Turn from the dusty ways
To find thee in thy green and still retreat.
Here is no vision wide outspread
Before the lonely and exalted seat
Of all-embracing knowledge. Here, instead,
A little garden, and a sheltered nook,
With outlooks brief and sweet
Across the meadows, and along the brook,-
A little stream that little knows
Of the great sea towards which it gladly flows,-
A little field that bears a little wheat
To make a portion of earth's daily bread.
The vast cloud-armies overhead
Are marshalled, and the wild wind blows
Its trumpet, but thou canst not tell
Whence the storm comes nor where it goes.
Nor dost thou greatly care, since all is well;
Thy daily task is done,
And though a lowly one,
Thou gavest it of thy best,
And art content to rest
In patience till its slow reward is won.
Not far thou lookest, but thy sight is clear;
Not much thou knowest, but thy faith is dear;
For life is love, and love is always near.
Here friendship lights the fire, and every heart,
Sure of itself and sure of all the rest,
Dares to be true, and gladly takes its part
In open converse, bringing forth its best:
Here is Sweet music, melting every chain
Of lassitude and pain:
And here, at last, is sleep, the gift of gifts,
The tender nurse, who lifts
The soul grown weary of the waking world,
And lays it, with its thoughts all furled,
Its fears forgotten, and its passions still,
On the deep bosom of the Eternal Will."

She comes, benign enchantress, heav'n born PEACE!
With mercy beaming in her radiant eye;
She bids the horrid din of battle cease,
And at her glance the savage passions die.
'Tis Nature's festival, let earth rejoice,
And pour to Liberty exulting songs,
In distant regions, with according voice,
Let Man the vict'ry bless, its prize to Man belongs.
II.
Resistless Freedom! when she nerves the arm,
No vulgar triumph crowns the hero's might;
She, she alone can spread a moral charm
O'er war's fell deeds, and sanctify the fight.
O, GALLIA ! in this bright immortal hour,
How proud a trophy binds thy laurel'd brow!
Republic, hail! whose independent power
All earth contested once, all earth confesses now.
III.
Protecting spirits of the glorious dead!
Ah, not in vain the hero's noble toil,
Ah, not in vain the patriot's blood is shed,
That blood shall consecrate his native soil.
Illustrious names! to hist'ry's record dear,
And breath'd when some high impulse fires the bard,
For you shall virtue pour the glowing tear,
And your remember'd deeds shall still your country guard.
IV.
And thou, lov'd BRITAIN , my parental Isle!
Secure, encircled by thy subject waves,
Thou, land august, where Freedom rear'd her pile,
While gothic night obscur'd a world of slaves;
Thy genius, that indignant heard the shock
Of frantic combat, strife unmeet for thee,
Now views triumphant, from his sea-girt rock,
Thee unsubdued alone, for thou alone wert free!
V.
O, happy thy misguided efforts fail'd,
My Country! when with tyrant-hosts combin'd--
O, hideous conquest, had thy sword prevail'd,
And crown'd the impious league against mankind!
Thou nurse of great design, of lofty thought,
What homicide, had thy insensate rage
Effac'd the sacred lesson thou hast taught,
And with thy purest blood inscrib'd on glory's page.
VI.
Ah, rather haste to Concord's holy shrine,
Ye rival nations, haste with joy elate;
Your blending garlands round her altar twine,
And bind the wounds of no immortal hate:
Go--breathe responsive rituals o'er the sod
Where Freedom martyrs press an early grave;
Go--vow that never shall their turf be trod
By the polluting step of tyrant or of slave.
VII.
And from your shores the abject vices chase,
That low Ambition generous souls disdain,
Corruption blasting every moral grace,
Servility that kneels to bless his chain;
O, Liberty, those demons far remove,
Come, nymph severely good, sublimely great!
Nor to the raptur'd hope of mortals prove
Like those illusive dreams that pass the iv'ry gate.
VII.
New Age! that roll'st o'er man thy dawning year,
Ah, sure all happy omens hail thy birth,
Sure whiter annals in thy train appear,
And purer glory cheers the gladden'd earth:
Like the young eagle, when his stedfast glance
Meets the full sun-beam in his upward flight,
So thou shalt with majestic step advance,
And fix thy dauntless eye on Liberty and Light."
886,Emotion,PeacePoemsSonnetToPeaceOfMindPoembyHelenMariaWilliams,"Sweet Peace! ah, lead me from the thorny dale,
Where desolate my wand'ring steps have fled;
Far from the sunny paths which others tread,
While youth enlivens, and while joys prevail.
Then I no more shall vanished hopes bewail,
No more the fruitless tear shall love to shed,
When pensive eve her cherish'd gloom has spread,
And day's bright tints, like my short pleasures, fail!
Yet lead me not where blooms the glowing rose,
But lead me where the cypress branches wave;
Thou hast a shelt'ring cell for cureless woes,
A home of refuge, where no tempests rave;
There would my weary heart in youth repose,
Beneath the turf that shrouds an early grave."

9     He is thy gracious friend
10       And (O my Soul awake!)
11   Did in pure love descend,

888,Emotion,PeacePoemsPeacetruePeacePoembyJeanMallette,"Alas, I've searched the world to find
That Peace begins within the mind.
It doesnot rest in other men.
Alone, within, will Peace begin.
No movement, plea, or gathered clan
Can force a peaceful state or plan.
It is the individual who
Must make his dreams of peace come true.
You may not find your neighbor kind,
But donot try to change his mind.
Some will not yield to good intentions.
Forget these ones; avoid dissensions.
Meditate your cares away,
And if they fail to leave, then pray.
Then you will know what Peace is of-
Defeat of Hate; the reign of Love."

And caught our youth, and wakened us from sleeping,
With hand made sure, clear eye, and sharpened power,
To turn, as swimmers into cleanness leaping,
Glad from a world grown old and cold and weary,
Leave the sick hearts that honour could not move,
And half-men, and their dirty songs and dreary,
And all the little emptiness of love!
Oh! we, who have known shame, we have found release there,
Where there's no ill, no grief, but sleep has mending,
Naught broken save this body, lost but breath;
Nothing to shake the laughing heart's long peace there
But only agony, and that has ending;
And the worst friend and enemy is but Death."
891,Emotion,PeacePoemsThePeaceTrainPoembyMichaelPhilips,"You can’t rely on the peace train,
always jumping the tracks
or taking the wrong one
stopping at the wrong stations
and bypassing the right ones
always arriving late or not at all.
Well, enough of that banal analogy.
Even Cat Stevens is off that jag now,
Should I change my name too,
change my appearance,
maybe some tinted contacts and a wig?
I’ll get on board as a forlorn salaryman,
riding the rails until I feel the rumble and steel everywhere I go,
getting jostled by manikins in my sleep,
drinking bitter coffee instead of the Chateau Latour I deserve,
longing for an escape pod to a 19th century  pastoral canvas,
or an express elevator to God,
who will smile knowingly and
speak to me in my own vernacular
and thank me
for infiltrating
and leaving the time bomb on
the commuter peace train.

892,Emotion,PeacePoemsPeaceBeWithYouPoembyCJHeck,"The man was seated in a pew,
sandwiched between
his wife and children,
head bowed,
all piety and innocence
on his face
mouthing the words
to the preacher's prayer.
Were his thoughts with God
I wondered, or the woman
I saw leaving his car
following a passionate kiss
the day before.
(I was again reminded
not to judge, lest I be judged)
and I'm sure not perfect.
It's said that heaven
has many rooms
- maybe even one for him.
As for me, when the time comes,
I believe I'll request another floor.
Peace be with you."

Living among a big family

her innocence,
making her life colourless.
Demon frightened her so much
she dare not open her mouth.

Her heart bled. She recoiled back

Innocence gone without my submission
Innocence lost through another's plan
Innocence no longer for another man
Innocence turned to hatred and fear
Innocence gone, no man can come near
Innocence taken from a little girls heart
Innocence replaced by mistrust, you thought you were smart
Innocence dissapears like dew in the sun
Innocence faded before it's begun
Innocence obscured like a cloud over the moon
Innocence ripped away too soon"

last pose
beside an old Thai wall
that separate
the pure from the prude
the promiscuous from those
still wanting to be one
without thinking of any
possibility of unrest

hypocrisy
like a black coat on a warm weather
in this tropical part of
the world
i must accept, i am seduced
and i am throwing all my education away

897,Emotion,InnocencePoemsTheInnocenceOfGoldPoembyKailaGeorge,"I flicked of the TV
At a news report
About another child
Lost in innocence no more
I was once
An innocent child
Living so happy
Till I was dealt
One of life's blows
And just like the children
I learn of today
Losing their innocence
That's torn from their souls
It drowns us all
In the degradation of life
I want to scream
I want to shout
Make all this carnage stop
Why do you ask?
Would I even bother to say?
I just want you to know
What its like for a child
To lose in themselves
The innocence of gold
You cry with a passion
Inside your lost soul
You know not what to say
You know not what to do
You feel so alone
You feel so used
You hide all your secrets
And you cry every day
And pray ever night
Oh God take my life
You drown in your sorrows
Every single day
And wonder each time
What have I done in my life?
To deserve such cruelty
That's dealt this cruel life
But life goes on
You learn to be brave
You learn to ignore
Your family and friends
You learn to ignore
An out stretched hand
I know I am lucky
To be here today
So I advocate for children
Still trapped in this fate"
898,Emotion,InnocencePoemsAdversityOfArbitraryKillingOfInnocencePoembyDmitriyKokarev,"The seed has been planted
Inside the earth the seed will grow
At the instance of the sow
The spirit has been awaken
And life has been granted
Another soul to enter into this world of adversity
With lack of water
And lack of the sun rays of light
Will the seed develop
Will the seed sprout
And after the nine harsh months
Into this world the flower came
Only to be picked by apathy
And thrown away two blocks away
With no guilt nor sense of fear
With colors bright and scent so sweet
No sins committed
An altruistic soul and mind
Witnessing death before the taste of life
Seeing the dark instead of light
Creation of life
Sparked the match that lit the candle of decay"
899,Emotion,InnocencePoemsWhenChildrenLoseTheirInnocencePoembyFrancisDuggan,"The innocence of childhood it is a marvellous thing
And all children are untainted in their life's early Spring
But by the time they've reached their teens their innocence they've lost
And the experience that we gain from age always comes at a cost.
When children lose their innocence they lose their gift of joy
The joy that comes from innocence in every young girl and boy
Compared to us young children see life quite differently
Of the guilt of corruption they are completely free.
I have such happy memories of when I was a boy
My childhood years were happy years but time just seemed to fly
And the experience that I've gained from life it came at a great cost
For I lost something beautiful when innocence I lost."
900,Emotion,InnocencePoemsInnocencePoembyJacquiBroad,"When I was small, I was taught
you don't judge people on how they look.
Years later, this happened,
and the story repeats itself.
Hand-in-hand, they came walking down the street.
Pretty little girl, with a blush on the cheeks.
The doll with blue eyes, came with as friend.
The mother smiled lovingly down at her child.
The sun shined bright,
and out of pure joy, the girl lauged with delight,
there was a stone in her shoe, and mom had to wait.
And so people started gathering to see this sight.
'Who is that ugly woman, Mommy? ' asked a frightened boy.
'Don't let she catch me! ' one cried behind his mother's dress.
'Don't be afraid! ' scolded an unpatient mother.
'If you're naughty, I'm gonna give you to her! ' she threatened the boy, then.
I looked at the people around me.
Why can't they just let the woman be?
She carries the scars of a fire-accident,
but her child looks like an angel.
'What is wrong, Mommy? ' asked the little girl.
She looked confused at her mother's tears.
'Don't cry, Mommy.'
She smiled and looked with love at her mom.
Then swinging her mom's hand again,
they walked passed people,
still staring, after them..."
901,Emotion,InnocencePoemsInnocencePoembyvamsikrishna,"As the baby wakes frm his bed
he sees the world arnd him
wonders what is here and why it is,
he moves on to see things,
less complex to understand what is goin on
he understands only two emotions of love and pain
both of which stay with him in loss and gain
he conveys evrything in laughter and cry
like we grown ups have never bothered to try
the way he is and his innocence makes me wonder
ah wht a day to live afterall to see a boy of such wonder
his evry movement is observed with such care
tht even people dying want to glare
his laughter is such a medicene
tht  any  disease can be cured by it

Listen to my confession
and tell me what I should have done
I see you in the morning
I see you in the night
I see your face
But I never see your eyes
You took away my innocence
You took away my life

But this time I'm a man
I saw you hurt someone
I said I'd die for you

you took away my innocence
But I took away your life"

Pinest in the gladsome ray,
Soiled beneath the common tread
Far from thy protecting spray!
When the partridge o'er the sheaf
Whirred along the yellow vale,
Sad, I saw thee, heedless leaf!
Love the dalliance of the gale.
Lightly didst thou, foolish thing!
Heave and flutter to his sighs,
While the flatt'rer on his wing
Wooed and whispered thee to rise.
Gayly from thy mother stalk
Wert thou danced and wafted high;
Soon on this unsheltered walk
Flung to fade, to rot, and die!"

Soft.
Full of peace.
No vandalism.
No wrong.
No sorrow.
No pain.
It's my field of innocence.
It's my life.
The place I dream about.
I know I am very young,
To early for me,
But when I pass.
I will go to this world.
Heaven,
Though, I like to call it field of innocence.
I don't know why.
Seemed fitting.
The innocent are there,
Resting in the quiet peace,
With our Lord Jesus.

And when I do,
I want to go to Heaven.

At her side.

907,Emotion,InnocencePoemsDeathOfInnocencePoembyTheodoraTheoOnken,"It seems like Light Years ago
That sweet innocence
Like a flower in the bud
Growing in new existance
Fresh and un-flawed
Beauty and angelic substance
In the Garden unmarred
Basking in the sun with no resistance
Where oh where did i go?
It all happened so fast
One day i was pure growing tall
The next-plucked way to fast
Put in a vase amongst other flowers
Of equal or very close age
Devoured by eyes of the lusty Gardners
My innocence turned into rage
A day passed-perhaps two
Time was really irrevelant to me
Every day was the same for us all
Fresh water-and slow death agony
I felt it come upon me
Like the goodness was draining me dry
Loosing all of my substance
Bending over i knew i would die
Ragged and wilted i fought
As the others alongside of me
But resistance proved to be no assistance
The day the innocence in me was set free
And into the trash we all landed
Despairing our very last breath
My petals no longer like velvet
But a dried mixture of long fought floral death!"
908,Emotion,InnocencePoemsSheWalksWithAKindOfInnocenceNovelineePoembyGertStrydom,"(after Lord George Gordon Byron)
The soft glowing radiance of her face
with hair tumbling down in a auburn tress
brings to her a unnamed kind of grace,
her thoughts do only loveliness express
as she walks with a kind of innocence
and when I meet the glance of her dear eyes
in them I can find no kind of offence,
any self-centeredness, her expressions denies,
they twinkle like the sun, like starry skies."
909,Emotion,InnocencePoemsGrowthInnocenceAdulthoodPoembyMariaRose,"Fuelled by my innocence
I was on my way to the adulthood.
I had my own pace
I never hurried and
I never wanted to.
Some people around me
seemed to have found that
I was too slow and decided to speed me up.
It was an unexpected night.
(Otherwise I would have fled)
I know, a rough footstep,
the stench of whiskey and
a pair of rocky hands
drained my fuel and speeded me
up to the adulthood.
I grew up to realize
that Death is deliverance
and growth is fatal."

And laughing is heard on the hill,
My heart is at rest within my breast
And everything else is still
Then come home my children the sun is gone down
And the dews of night arise
Come come leave off play, and let us away
Till the morning appears in the skies
No no let us play, for it is yet day
And we cannot go to sleep
Besides in the sky, the little birds fly
And the hills are all covered with sheep
Well well go & play till the light fades away
And then go home to bed
The little ones leaped & shouted & laugh'd
And all the hills echoed"

I stepped in their shoes and cried in pain.If you too feel the same, then step out and spread awareness among the kids.Listen to your child.Save innocence! ! 'Stop child Abuse'! ! !
I am a happy child
With a wonderful smile
I get good grades
The teacher’s apple-pie
My mummy loves me
My daddy alike
But when my uncle loves me
I so dislike
I hate the touch
When he touches my butt
He keens to unwrap
In the warmth of his lap
I feel scared to share
Do nothing in despair
My uncle is so big
His fingers, his fist
I get the penny for the pain
A chocolate, a dress, an express train
Those keep lying in the foyer
I wish to trash them
Being a destroyer
Oh mummy! If you could just see
What it has been on me
I get nightmares even in day
I will be out of this love someday
I am smiling, wish you could see me cry
I am dancing on a dead man’s choir
The sweet lullabies he made me hear
Hurts me and my cuddly teddy bear
If only you had been right close to me
You could have seen the dead child in me
If only you had ears, to hear my cries
I would have been the apple of your eyes
No red, yellow, green or purples
I am black
Wish I could build my rainbow of colours
And get my childhood back! ! !

912,Emotion,InnocencePoemsSongsOfInnocenceIntroductionPoembyWilliamBlake,"Piping down the valleys wild
Piping songs of pleasant glee
On a cloud I saw a child.
And he laughing said to me.
Pipe a song about a Lamb:
So I piped with merry chear,
Piper, pipe that song again--
So I piped, he wept to hear.
Drop thy pipe thy happy pipe
Sing thy songs of happy chear,
So I sung the same again
While he wept with joy to hear
Piper sit thee down and write
In a book that all may read--
So he vanished from my sight
And I pluck'd a hollow reed.
And I made a rural pen,
And I stained the water clear,
And I wrote my happy songs,
Every child may joy to hear."
913,Emotion,InnocencePoemsInnocenceIsWeaknessPoembyMohammedHassanPiracyInTheMediterranean,"I heard too many songs of love, and I'm sick of love
sometimes I lie to be like everyone
had you ever told someone a big lie?
and you had believed it
only one thing to be known, everyone lies
don't forget it
but some of them lie because they are breathing on lie
and some of them wants to be like everyone by lie
I'm the antilove, I'm the slayer venom, I'm the killing poison
I can pick my soul it falls in front of you
I don't want to be sweet innocent thing
innocence is weakness
only one thing to be known, everyone dies
don't you think it
but some of them die because they don't deserve life
and some of them want to die because they didn't live
hurry up and lock the door, look back if no one's there?
so, wear your escaping cloth, you can't run you can hide
just kill yourself because you're dead in my mind
you don't belong to me,  you belong to yourself
I lost my soul so long ago"
914,Emotion,InnocencePoemsDeceptionsInnocencePoembyAmyFifita,"Like a seagull flying high,
As I hear your distant cry.
Not of pain but of suggestion,
Wait for me is the question.
Gliding down with all concern,
The bird I found will take its turn.
Disguised in innocence and great meekness,
My ignorance becomes my weakness.
Plucking feathers from my wings,
It’s unnoticeable, for innocence she sings.
Shaded by deceptions peaceful nature,
Now my trust she will capture.
Follows me down to the vigorous sea,
And still in her eyes you see purity.
Sending vultures to eat my soul,
I’m struggling up as you call.
Gliding up to the surface,
The sea water has revealed her purpose.
My feathers are torn; they’ll grow back,
Deception’s innocence has now lacked."

Innocence silenced
to soon
Innocence taken
there's no truth over the lie
Innocence taken
by those who thought
I'll be the same again
by those who thought
its ok to kill
by those who thought
it's ok to take
Innocence replaced
by fear and mistrust
Innocence disappeared
before it came
Innocence taken
by those who
laughed at every cry
by those who had none
Innocence reflecting
a little girls eyes
innocence taken away
without my permission"

An act without shame!
A relation without name.

The evils in her, laughing over

He spoke once before
Innocence!
He rigged of in pleasant odours
Innocence!
He displayed with his first step on the dance floor
Not knowing
What was next or what was following!
When he bellowed, he bellowed
And his silence too was without pretence
Now knowledge has made its entrance
Gradually exhibiting its presence
And his innocence
Has dissolved into a distasteful fragrance

Acres of bright, yellow effluence

Into the wilderness of the valley.

By the voice of innocence.

Stirs a fly, vanquished to submission.
The pastures of winged worlds are closed
And the prey trembles
With the voice of innocence."

I swam the laps of innocence
The laps of an angel by my side
The sound of laughter by my side
The happiness swimming abreast of me
I rolled down the hills of light
I rolled unrolling the scrolls of innocence
The scrolls of all the white by my side
The hues of a multitude of smiles by my side
Joy cries joy screams abreast of me
It was so easy so easy to swim
So easy to swim the laps of innocence
The laps of an angel by my side
The sound of laughter by my side
The happiness swimming abreast of me
So easy to roll down the hills of light
To roll unrolling the scrolls of innocence
The scrolls of the white by my side
The hues of a multitude of smiles by my side
Joy cries joy screams abreast of me
The flickering whiteprints of a snowflake heart
The twinkling joy of my fast beating heart
The sparkling breath of my wind spinned heart
The shimmering light of my angel fed heart
The beat the beat of the snow spelled heart
So beautifully taken breath blown away

927,Emotion,InnocencePoemsMyInnocencePoembyIshitaMehta,"I met a little girl,
As fragile as could be
And i don't know somehow,
She reminded me of me!
In her little eye she saw a dream,
Of happiness unmatched
But every time she made it true
There came a little catch
And each time a little tear,
Would fall on her knee
But again and again she tried
For she wanted to succeed.
Her innocence was soon broken
In light of further days,
For every time she tried to smile,
Darkness pushed her away.
And though she broke entirely,
From within
Outside, she tried to put a show
And tried to mingle in.
And she tried to piece together
Her unhappy shattered heart,
But inside she was tearing
Slowly. part by part.
I met a little girl
As fragile as could be,
It's hard to belive, I know
That girl was me."

A kind of state out of nature.

Without blood running wild.
A crying silence growing.
A silent cry inside hidden.
A stare at the forbidden:
Words without meaning -
Innocence and silence."

Lying bloody on the floor.
No longer with innocence,
I'd had before.
I'll be forever changed,
By just one thrust,
A penetration of hatred,
To rip away my trust.
You abuse my body,
My soul and my mind.
With one careless shove,
You start to grind.
As you begin your assault,
I close my eyes.
Soon it will be over,
So sure I want to die.
My tears begin to fall
With each wince of pain.
I wonder why,
What have you to gain?
As I continue,
To push you away,
Your pace gets faster.
Your eyes turn grey.
Slowly you stop,
With one final thrust,
My heart is torn;
I no longer can trust.
I feel the hatred
Flowing into me.
Now so dirty with filth,
I seem to be.
You wickedly laugh,
As you rise from the floor.
You wipe yourself on me,
Then head for the door.
Now here I am
Beaten, Broken, and Bound,
Lying on the floor,
Uttering no sound."

Not that we have made
Does not want a facade
Of the limited and narrow world that we parade
It asks for a mind rich in Innocence

It wants a Being whose heart is Full
Rich, clear which does not get pulled
By jaded and petty eyesight
Just capable of intense feeling in all its might
Be sensitive with your nerves
Your eyes, your body, your voice, your ears
See the beauty of the tree, the smile of the child
The agony of the woman without a meal, the animals in wild

Denude you abruptly of all grace
My senile world
O innocent fairy
ill keep veiled in my silence
and let you  smile in your sleep
as deep as the gurgling Nile
while I stay up long into the dusks
and measure

Yet marred by the pain in her eyes.
The tears she sheds
Fall to the ground
Like liquid diamonds
And shatter there alone.
And I cry for her
Stolen Innocence.
Tis a beautiful thing,
The raw purity of
Innocence in Youthful Bloom.
It's meant to last forever.
Meant to eternally bless those
Endowed with such a gift.
But when choice is stolen
And Beauty turns to Brokenness
I weep for  its
Stolen Innocence."

Don't mourn for my passing.
I sold my soul to evade the light,
There's nothing left worth redeeming.
I remember a time,
Smiling child, picture of perfection.
In joyous resplendence, you danced.
Born in day,
But even your light wasted away.
Lay me to rest tonight.
Don't weep for my losses,
I sold my heart to escape the pain,
There's nothing left of me to save.
I remember a time,
Foolish child, see what befalls the flawed?
In the absence of light, you changed.
Born in day,
But reality eroded your heart away.
Hide me away tonight.
Don't beg for my forgiveness,
I took my life to escape from you,
Theres nothing left of me
Tonight."
936,Emotion,InnocencePoemsLossOfInnocencePoembyGeorgeGrogan,"A single picture has brought it all back again.
I can smell the smells
and hear the sounds
as though it were yesterday
and not the ancient history of my youth.
I close my eyes and feel his hot breath on my face,
its sickenly sweet smell nauseats me.
His unshaven face touches mine
and I retch as the memory overwhelms me.
I can almost feel the cool air blowing in the tent
I hear the sound of cars going by,
a hundred,
a thousand,
one,
...God,
rushing off
going by
unaware
not knowing
oblivious
to my struggle
and the hot red pain
as I am awakened
My innocent, not lost, but stolen
(the awakening came)
like the shock of a rapier  piercing the heart of a novice fencer.
or a sun soaked body thrown into an icy river …
I was stunned by the revelation
paralyzed,
numbed
and mute.
All the whispers and snickers
Jibes and insinuations
Came into focus in an instant
I understood
Like adam,  I am not nude,  but naked on the inside
Shame, like a jacket falls on me,  and I put it on
For it fits so well
Humiliation hangs over me and bends my head down low
My soul like clay  was shaped by ugly hands
Disfigured, damaged dysfunctional forever
I looked into his eyes and I think  “betrayed again”,
Treacherous brown eyes seem to follow me
Waiting for me,
I was foolish enough to be open and vulnerable,
gushing like a school girl with raw emotion.
He struck  like a cobra, fangs sinking in, pumping poison
He has taken me, raped me and left me for dead
and i am once again
used and abandoned"
937,Emotion,InnocencePoemsInnocenceFoundPoembyCherylGreear,"In a world where innocence is lost so quickly, I pondered if it
truly exists at all. Where does one go to find it . . . this freedom of a pure, existence amidst an age-old classroom called life who teaches that innocence is best ignored. It was when I stopped looking that I was able to ""see"" a world with an
abundance of innocence and I chose it for my guide. Stop for a
moment and watch nature. Listen to all that is to be heard; for , this is
the true teacher of all living things. The smell of a rose, the call of a
wolf, the sight of a bird in flight. Nature's untainted innocence is
responsible for all these things. Nature hears no voice but it's own; yet, speaks to all who will listen. A
voice as constant as a rising sun or branches swaying in the
wind . . . for these are the soft-spoken words of innocence."

is the rock in evidence

Once, that stance was part and parcel of all my matters!
Excavation can help me, I take this dig.
Cradle to grade one, infancy free verse at recite
From there a saga of tutoring, a phase of delight
Forever forgiven, naive menaces, a period of elite
It’s time then society norms dictate man’s plight.

Costless thrillers, pastime, under the vigilant scanners
Salt water couldn’t heal the pain, but it did pivot
As a proof of living, had to hold pre-printed banners.
Extensive damage, reports my dig.
Discolored utterances played havoc, gullet to blame
Etiquette pushed into belly to help in digestion claim
Fed with indigestible cereals, system hanged in shame
The so called Innocence departed under the foot into the drain.

Playful laughter in a garden
Dark eyes flashing, curly hair
Infant innocence happy there:
'Dandelions, pretty flowers
Mommy, you and I can wear
Yellow tassels on our slippers;
Each of us have got a pair.'
Dark clouds gather in that garden
Shining sinister, slithering serpent,
Nonresistant childhood snare.
'Stolen candies, sweets are tempting
As I coil about your thigh.
Taste how sweet they are, like honey,
Like the secrets that we share.'
Secrets growing choke the flowers
Robbing laughter; until soon
Mother's heart must sadly sigh.
'Oh, my daughter, pretty daughter,
Gone the luster in her eye.
She is keeping secrets from me.
Why has she not told me why? '
Little girls grow to be adults
Childhood secrets scars become,
Scars that taint her every song:
'Why are candies venom bitter?
Why is laughter like a cry?
Why has happiness forever
Scorned me and passed me by?
'Within me lives a memory
That will haunt me 'til I die.
That will haunt me 'til I die.'"

full of chuckles, love and great laughter.
Filled with innocence through and through,
with lots of hugs and kisses too.
I know proud grandparents will all agree,
the love we receive is precious and free.
They have no motives, no deep held secrets.
Holding on to us tight, cradled in our arms
filling us with a calm of their innocent charms.

the setting sun glinted all around
the babbling brook was the only sound
He laid her down gently beside him
and wrapped his coat round her shoulders
she would gladly have stayed till infinity
as he took away her virginity
The smoke from the campfire curled up
as the dying embers burnt away
the only evidence left behind
was the imprint of bodies, two entwined"

Wrought by the tenderest of Hands:
Eyes that behold love in every face,
Too pure and ignorant of evil.
Little hands stretched out for airlifts;
Childish whirls, eruptions of laughter.
Feet that patter in delight
Unable to flee from brutes.
A precious Gift
Handled by the coarsest of hands:
Ruddy cheeks smothered with slaps, not kisses.
Frizzled hair matted with cruel blows, not caressed with a comb.
Crushing bear-hugs by spineless wrestlers.
Cherubic face powdered with chocolate disguise bruises
Ever-present lacerations blamed on the quirk of Nature.
A precious Gift
Treated as a burden:
Scores of injuries
Blind carers
A blood-splattered cot.
At last,
Eternal rest."

Now my innocence is gone forever
and he's the one to blame
the only way I see I can get it back
is to get a rope and hang.
He's hurt me so badly
so many times, in so many ways
and even though it's in the past now
it's still hurting me these days
i'm proud to say i've survived this long
but it all must come to and end
my heart is just too broken to go on
and doing this will help it mend

And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand
And Eternity in an hour.
A Robin Red breast in a Cage
Puts all Heaven in a Rage.
A dove house fill'd with doves & Pigeons
Shudders Hell thro' all its regions.
A dog starv'd at his Master's Gate
Predicts the ruin of the State.
A Horse misus'd upon the Road
Calls to Heaven for Human blood.
Each outcry of the hunted Hare
A fibre from the Brain does tear.
A Skylark wounded in the wing,
A Cherubim does cease to sing.
The Game Cock clipp'd and arm'd for fight
Does the Rising Sun affright.
Every Wolf's & Lion's howl
Raises from Hell a Human Soul.
The wild deer, wand'ring here & there,
Keeps the Human Soul from Care.
The Lamb misus'd breeds public strife
And yet forgives the Butcher's Knife.
The Bat that flits at close of Eve
Has left the Brain that won't believe.
The Owl that calls upon the Night
Speaks the Unbeliever's fright.
He who shall hurt the little Wren
Shall never be belov'd by Men.
He who the Ox to wrath has mov'd
Shall never be by Woman lov'd.
The wanton Boy that kills the Fly
Shall feel the Spider's enmity.
He who torments the Chafer's sprite
Weaves a Bower in endless Night.
The Catterpillar on the Leaf
Repeats to thee thy Mother's grief.
Kill not the Moth nor Butterfly,
For the Last Judgement draweth nigh.
He who shall train the Horse to War
Shall never pass the Polar Bar.
The Beggar's Dog & Widow's Cat,
Feed them & thou wilt grow fat.
The Gnat that sings his Summer's song
Poison gets from Slander's tongue.
The poison of the Snake & Newt
Is the sweat of Envy's Foot.
The poison of the Honey Bee
Is the Artist's Jealousy.
The Prince's Robes & Beggars' Rags
Are Toadstools on the Miser's Bags.
A truth that's told with bad intent
Beats all the Lies you can invent.
It is right it should be so;
Man was made for Joy & Woe;
And when this we rightly know
Thro' the World we safely go.
Joy & Woe are woven fine,
A Clothing for the Soul divine;
Under every grief & pine
Runs a joy with silken twine.
The Babe is more than swadling Bands;
Throughout all these Human Lands
Tools were made, & born were hands,
Every Farmer Understands.
Every Tear from Every Eye
Becomes a Babe in Eternity.
This is caught by Females bright
And return'd to its own delight.
The Bleat, the Bark, Bellow & Roar
Are Waves that Beat on Heaven's Shore.
The Babe that weeps the Rod beneath
Writes Revenge in realms of death.
The Beggar's Rags, fluttering in Air,
Does to Rags the Heavens tear.
The Soldier arm'd with Sword & Gun,
Palsied strikes the Summer's Sun.
The poor Man's Farthing is worth more
Than all the Gold on Afric's Shore.
One Mite wrung from the Labrer's hands
Shall buy & sell the Miser's lands:
Or, if protected from on high,
Does that whole Nation sell & buy.
He who mocks the Infant's Faith
Shall be mock'd in Age & Death.
He who shall teach the Child to Doubt
The rotting Grave shall ne'er get out.
He who respects the Infant's faith
Triumph's over Hell & Death.
The Child's Toys & the Old Man's Reasons
Are the Fruits of the Two seasons.
The Questioner, who sits so sly,
Shall never know how to Reply.
He who replies to words of Doubt
Doth put the Light of Knowledge out.
The Strongest Poison ever known
Came from Caesar's Laurel Crown.
Nought can deform the Human Race
Like the Armour's iron brace.
When Gold & Gems adorn the Plow
To peaceful Arts shall Envy Bow.
A Riddle or the Cricket's Cry
Is to Doubt a fit Reply.
The Emmet's Inch & Eagle's Mile
Make Lame Philosophy to smile.
He who Doubts from what he sees
Will ne'er believe, do what you Please.
If the Sun & Moon should doubt
They'd immediately Go out.
To be in a Passion you Good may do,
But no Good if a Passion is in you.
The Whore & Gambler, by the State
Licenc'd, build that Nation's Fate.
The Harlot's cry from Street to Street
Shall weave Old England's winding Sheet.
The Winner's Shout, the Loser's Curse,
Dance before dead England's Hearse.
Every Night & every Morn
Some to Misery are Born.
Every Morn & every Night
Some are Born to sweet Delight.
Some ar Born to sweet Delight,
Some are born to Endless Night.
We are led to Believe a Lie
When we see not Thro' the Eye
Which was Born in a Night to Perish in a Night
When the Soul Slept in Beams of Light.
God Appears & God is Light
To those poor Souls who dwell in the Night,
But does a Human Form Display
To those who Dwell in Realms of day."
947,Emotion,InnocencePoemsInnocenceRegainedPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"I was visibly moved and perturbed
Out of gear completely and disturbed
Mind so much occupied and probed,
Hair straight up as if not combed,
The moment childhood was over
Innocence and good smile lost the cover
Fight for survival and supremacy gained,
All sort of indecency settled in mind and regained
Nobody could actually judge the real face behind
Foes stopped guessing and baffled the friends
How could a small boy of yesterday could boldly stand?
Uneasy prevalence of calm on face and statesman like trend?
I learnt all the tolerance through the slapping of teacher
Something more gathered from the speeches of preacher,
Rest all came from sweet tongue of beloved mother,
Assertive and bold initiative attitude from father,
I was well trained for crisis and mastered the art,
Was in full capacity to raise big mart?
Inner capabilities and tactics used at full length,
Confidence and trust was the main strength,
My eyes couldn’t believe this could happen
All friends starred with eyes wide open
I was getting success with masterly stroke
Without hurting anybody and not even to provoke
I made them wonder when met across the street
Scaling new heights everyday with all the challenges to meet
Not compromising at all with even own principles
Admiration and applause more as if from staunch disciples
When I sit on the top of the hill,
And look back to think of strong will
I needed to pursue it with simple kill,
It was efforts and strong desire coupled with zeal
What I did was in pursuant of the goal
You hand will get dirty in business of coal
It is not easy to survive in race
How many difficulties you have to f ace?
I did and managed whatever was possible
I proved to self and others what was impossible
I steered the course amidst rough weather
It was adding glory and fame in feather
Person should not retire but must think
Eyes to be kept open and to wink
Whatever done In past was really essential?
Was it potential danger or test crucial?
I think I must go back to regain innocence,
Prove its worth and avoid pretence,
I must live in present and feel the presence,
Truly emotional but invariably with essence,
My present should not shadow the past,
No doubts should prevail and vote the cast,
I want to regain the precious innocence,
Live with it as if nothing happened since"

A little girl was playing in the garden 'round her home,
Mischief sparkled in her dark eyes and her curly hair was blond.
Innocent joy rang in the laughter of her happy, playful song:
'Dandelions are as pretty as the flowers that grow high.
I have picked some for you, Mommy, and I want to show you why.
They make tassels on our slippers; we can wear them, you and I.'
Into that happy garden crept a serpent black and long,
Shining sinister in the sunlight as he flicked a jeweled tongue.
Captivatedly she listened to his strange inviting song:
'Stolen candies can be sweeter than the ones your parents buy.
Taste how sweet they are, like honey, as I coil about your thigh.
It will be our little secret as we eat them, you and I.'
Secrets growing in a garden, in among the pretty blooms,
Rob children of their laughter; so that it was very soon
That a mother's heart was sighing a sad, foreboding tune:
'Oh, my daughter was so pretty, and I wish that I knew why
Such a change has come about her that it makes my spirit cry.
Her eyes have lost their glitter and she has not told me why.'
Little girls will always grow up; that, in life, has been decreed,
While secrets locked in childhood are concealed in history.
Yet the scars they are concealing will be sung in misery:
'Why do candies taste so bitter? Why does laughter make me cry?
Why do I have a feeling happiness has passed me by?
I'm living with a memory that will haunt me 'til I die.
Within me lives a memory that will haunt me 'til I die.'"

Lying on nails to wrest a superearth
from amnesty, I start bandaging the bruised
ethos of my native conscience –

to give up my home to fire, tending
the voiceless flora of a virgin rock.
The questions stand up, against
the black walls of silence. The blue birds

I could not make revolt
Their ill-intention
Crushed my ambition
With my utter innocence

But I forgot
My destined lot
They played with my passion
It satisfied their emotion
They warned me in a strange voice
I avoided it coz it was my choice
Their behaviour made me realize
I was of no use-without price
They were happy to see me in trouble
I was fool I made my grief double
False love they showed to hide their hatred
I came to know this bitter truth then I regretted
My defeat lay in their victory
Their road depended on my journey
I thought it must be an ending
People say it is only a beginning
If it is only a start
Who will then try to thwart
I want to ask a question to them
Did they not feel any kind of shame?
If it is a beginning
It will never last for ending
They have started  this game

Paraded through the streets like some kind of prize,

Dragged up onto this hellish platform, dignity stripped,

How ironic that life is  my final view when death comes to call,
Blindfold refused, rope placed around my neck,
Trembling uncontrolably... Goodbye cruel world,

956,Emotion,InnocencePoemsReturnToInnocencePoembyKyleShieldLaster,"Rags and things to clean the mess,
Dull pains below the belt.
That day for you was dreamy-
Filled with smiles you never felt.
Fresh blood of yours was turned foul, brown
And drops crashed from the sky.
You laid there with a crooked grin,
But I won't ask you why.
So given chance, would you die
To save your little soul? -
Take back that day in creaking clouds
To end this 'maybe' role?
This game you play won't crown to you-
A win, but common-sense,
Can give to you, to us a brief
Return to innocence."

to release him from bondage, trapped like a abalone.
Emotionally handicapped for someone to hear his cry,
but yet everyone is deaf no matter how hard he try.
Pretending like he is gifted with wisdom,
Still helpless and trapped in his mighty kingdom.
Frisky and ill-fated the qualities of his whole,
thoughts gushing in his mind as he grows ole.
That when in this world there will be a candle with a light,
which can be seen by anyone without sight.
Sacrificing himself when all he can do is taunt,
left with nothing but only him to flaunt.
Sober at people who thinks he is a gloat,
like as if they were free birds in the sky who float.
Crying at people who tells him he is too servile,
but doesn't know whether it can be futile.
Thinking to himself who are they to decide,
on land or sea his wish to reside.
Beliving that God to him is not fair,
Waiting for that day when he senses there is no air."

So I piped with merry cheer.
'Piper, pipe that song again;'
So I piped: he wept to hear.
'Drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe;
Sing thy songs of happy cheer:!'
So I sang the same again,
While he wept with joy to hear.
'Piper, sit thee down and write
In a book, that all may read.'
So he vanish'd from my sight;
And I pluck'd a hollow reed,
And I made a rural pen,
And I stain'd the water clear,
And I wrote my happy songs

moments seems to defuse by the bliss
the reeks when fester by knowing
when reconciled by the reef of reason

The triangular hill that hung
Under the Big Forth. They said

Is the same doorway everywhere.
Ashamed of what I loved
I flung her from me and called her a ditch
Although she was smiling at me with violets.
But now I am back in her briary arms
The dew of an Indian Summer lies
On bleached potato-stalks
What age am I?
I do not know what age I am,
I am no mortal age;
I know nothing of women,
Nothing of cities,
I cannot die
Unless I walk outside these whitethorn hedges."

For the age of innocence

Who went abysses too high
Who went insanity too nigh

Super-modern stuck in

Without even knowing that

Carry the name the peace of glory
You sub-modern undercurrent
Talking to its future
Gather together
Powers of the world
Light up little girls’ golden matches
Re-collect little boys lost in no man’s host
Gather together and strike
Dancing light on fragility
Delicate wire walkers
Scar lit star dust dancers
Spinning ashes spread
Spread beyond the waters
You sub-modern undercurrent
Talking to its future
Re-collect
Memories of Earth risen grown up
In knife edges shortcuts torn apart
Dying a Nietzche strength in
‘they’ll call me a sickness’ testament
Michael Angelo mocking
Bartholomeus’s skin
The Moses horns bone bricked
Into the creation of Earth
Re-collect

The high tide of returning faith
For the age of innocence
This is an unknown passion
A torment passion tearing to nothing
Torn to nothing brought
Torn out of nothing born
Reborn
Unmasking darkness and light
Un-dividing
A new health may carry its name
To say
To re-collect
Gather together and strike
Light steps of the paths
Stamps in sounds star bathed blessed
Sub-modern last choice manifest
Re-collect
Re-ligio
The high tide of returning faith
For the age of innocence."
966,Emotion,InnocencePoemsQuestionMarkedInnocencePoembyLoraCooley,"When we talked you promised
That you would never leave
Then I told you of the demons
And how they made me bleed
I made you promise crazy things
But your words weren’t enough
I couldn’t believe you loved me
I thought to love me was to tough
When I cry about my past
And say that I’m ashamed
I know that I am the one
Who is to be blamed
Then you hold me tight
And say that it’s okay
So I cry for my lack of innocence
And the things I couldn’t give away
When I can’t sleep through the night
And the memories start to hurt too much
I burn myself and tell you,
Because you’re the only one I trust
You say your better then you’re past
You tell me that I’m strong
You say that I’m the love of your life
But if you only knew
The kind of thoughts I think
And what I used to do
You tell me that it doesn’t matter
And that you love me anyway
So I cry for my stolen innocence
And the things I shouldn’t have given away
They all said my body lacked beauty
And it made my confidence fall apart
But when I let you look
You marveled at me like a work of art
I then held you close just to say
Remember this moment and don’t let it fade
So I cry for my question mark innocence
And the things I wish I gave away
I never felt a thing
Before I gave you my heart
And when those bad memories won’t fade
And I feel like I’ll fall apart
You will tell me you love me so
Then as you wrap your arms around me
And say you’ll never let me go
I know you really love me,
And you’ll keep me safe from harm
You know I’ve been hurt,
And abused in every kind of way
So I cry for my loss of innocence
And the things I gave away"

968,Emotion,InnocencePoemsTheInnocenceOfAnyFleshSleepingPoembyBrianPatten,"Sleeping beside you I dreamt
I woke beside you;
Waking beside you
I thought I was dreaming.
Have you ever slept beside an ocean?
Well yes,
It is like this.
The whole motion of landscapes, of oceans
Is within her.
She is
The innocence of any flesh sleeping,
So vulnerable
No protection is needed.
In such times
The heart opens,
Contains all there is,
There being no more than her.
In what country she is
I cannot tell.
But knowing – because there is love
And it blots out all demons –
She is safe,
I can turn,
Sleep well beside her.
Waking beside her I am dreaming.
Dreaming of such wakings
I am all love’s senses woken."
969,Emotion,InnocencePoemsInnocencePoembyRatnakarMandlik,"When I bypass you passes a chill
Through out my body, o lassi little
What of your possessions that lure me
For you in longing I begin to swim.
You are not a beauty celestial I know
Till my honor for you I can throw
Just to have a glance at you oh virgin
What for it happens I can not imaginbe.
Perhaps I have found in you a dream
With you I see innocence in my dreams
To be associated with my future consort,
Who must too possess an innocent heart.
Dare I can not to speak with you
Fearing it may give me a clue
Or it may throw me in sea of pain
Unveiling before me your non innocence."
970,Emotion,InnocencePoemsInnocencePoembyDonPearson,"I have caught tears in my mouth,
washed in the dust of the dead,
burned the grass in the meadows,
watched the fires spread.
I was told by my leaders
to kill in my country’s fight.
Crimes are defined by victors,
We say what’s right.
I flew into a building
to tear apart people’s lives.
I exult in destruction.
No hope survives.
My end is a beginning
to death on a massive scale,
more “collateral damage”,
more children wail.
I just followed my orders,
with no judgement as to wrongs,
dropped bombs where I was told to,
missed the death songs.
I can’t be held to be guilty,
my duty is to obey.
Others will face reprisals,
I’ll walk away.
My faith’s pursuit of money,
Towns round the world are aflame,
Profits require hard decisions,
No one’s to blame.
I don’t care that they’re starving.
I have got targets to meet.
What’s it to me you’re homeless?
Live on the street!
No one on earth can stop me.
I am beyond all their power.
My beliefs have gone global.
This is my hour!
I will raise the old gods here,
worship at altars of gold,
Rip flesh from my opponents,
ravish the old.
Now I can see my future,
I drink the blood of a child,
served in a famous restaurant,
where bones are piled.

how cruel world can be
first step outside the home
oh! it was better in the womb
expected people to be
like in fairytale movie
but the truth is darker
more darker then i see
i ran after desires
only to get wounded knee
people live without a soul
no emotions i can see
i realise i havent grown yet
want to go back to the cocoon i left
yet i have to fight
to make tomorrow bright
sometimes in the fight
starving for the light
remember you can loose
the innocence inside
no matter i lose or win
innocence keeps me away from sin
yes, i'm holding it
deep down my skin
and the day i die
i wish i die with innocence still within.........."
972,Emotion,InnocencePoemsInnocenceOfARosePoembyCandiceRenaeWilliams,"Love is delicate,
As like the petals of a rose
Love is innocent,
like the purity of a rose
Love is delightful,
like the smell of a rose
Love hurts,
like the thorns of a rose.
Love begins,
like a seed.
and like a rose,
If you water it;
It grows."
973,Emotion,InnocencePoemsTheDeathOfInnocencePoembyCynthiaBuhainBaello,"In covert dim light
A nymphet came
To grace his sight
With her small frame
He caught her scent
And closed his eyes
Felt fleeting movements
Soar him high
And as they kissed
He felt the bliss
Of escalating passion
The night was young
And before long
They'll lock
In emptied satisfaction
With deep desire
He yearned to touch
Her captivating youth
Undressing her
He watched
His lovely prostitute
The streetlight glazed
His eyes went wild
Despaired to see her face,
He saw the death
Of Innocence...
For his date was just
..........A child.
Child prostitution is the most cruel of all crimes as it preys on
an innocent child who cannot defend himself.

974,Emotion,InnocencePoemsInnocenceLostPoembykipperStagg,"Innocence lost!
All of his life people had beaten him down,
Made him feel useless,
Treated him like a clown.
Sweet Love met with a volley of blows,
A weeping Heart and a bloody nose!
Constant Abuse from a tender age,
Life left him bitter,
A heart full of rage!
No one to hear his impassioned cries!
No one to wipe all the tears from his eyes!
And now he's a man everything's stayed the same.
Living his life with a heart full of shame!"
975,Emotion,InnocencePoemsHolyThursdayInnocencePoembyWilliamBlake,"Twas on a Holy Thursday their innocent faces clean
The children walking two & two in red & blue & green
Grey headed beadles walked before with wands as white as snow
Till into the high dome of Pauls they like Thames waters flow
O what a multitude they seemed these flowers of London town
Seated in companies they sit with radiance all their own
The hum of multitudes was there but multitudes of lambs
Thousands of little boys & girls raising their innocent hands
Now like a mighty wind they raise to heaven the voice of song
Or like harmonious thunderings the seats of heaven among
Beneath them sit the aged men wise guardians of the poor
Then cherish pity, lest you drive an angel from your door"
976,Emotion,InnocencePoemsInnocencePoembyThomasTraherne,"But that which most I wonder at, which most
I did esteem my bliss, which most I boast,
And ever shall enjoy, is that within
I felt no stain, nor spot of sin.
No darkness then did overshade,
But all within was pure and bright,
No guilt did crush, nor fear invade
But all my soul was full of light.
A joyful sense and purity
Is all I can remember;
The very night to me was bright,
'Twas summer in December.
A serious meditation did employ
My soul within, which taken up with joy
Did seem no outward thing to note, but fly
All objects that do feed the eye.
While it those very objects did
Admire, and prize, and praise, and love,
Which in their glory most are hid,
Which presence only doth remove.
Their constant daily presence I
Rejoicing at, did see;
And that which takes them from the eye
Of others, offer'd them to me.
No inward inclination did I feel
To avarice or pride: my soul did kneel
In admiration all the day. No lust, nor strife,
Polluted then my infant life.
No fraud nor anger in me mov'd,
No malice, jealousy, or spite;
All that I saw I truly lov'd.
Contentment only and delight
Were in my soul. O Heav'n! what bliss
Did I enjoy and feel!
What powerful delight did this
Inspire! for this I daily kneel.
Whether it be that nature is so pure,
And custom only vicious; or that sure
God did by miracle the guilt remove,
And make my soul to feel his love
So early: or that 'twas one day,
Wherein this happiness I found;
Whose strength and brightness so do ray,
That still it seems me to surround;
What ere it is, it is a light
So endless unto me
That I a world of true delight
Did then and to this day do see.
That prospect was the gate of Heav'n, that day
The ancient light of Eden did convey
Into my soul: I was an Adam there
A little Adam in a sphere
Of joys! O there my ravish'd sense
Was entertain'd in Paradise,
And had a sight of innocence
Which was beyond all bound and price.
An antepast of Heaven sure!
I on the earth did reign;
Within, without me, all was pure;
I must become a child again."
977,Emotion,InnocencePoemsOftHaveIReadThatInnocenceRetreatsPoembyThomasParnell,"Oft have I read that Innocence retreats
Where cooling streams salute ye summer Seats
Singing at ease she roves ye field of flowrs
Or safe with shepheards lys among the bowrs
But late alas I crossd a country fare
And found No Strephon nor Dorinda there
There Hodge & William Joynd to cully ned
While Ned was drinking Hodge & William dead
There Cicely Jeard by day the slips of Nell
& ere ye night was ended Cicely fell
Are these the Virtues which adorn the plain
Ye bards forsake your old Arcadian Vein
To sheep those tender Innocents resign
The place where swains & nymphs are said to shine
Swains twice as Wicked Nymphs but half as sage
Tis sheep alone retrieve ye golden age."
978,Emotion,InnocencePoemsToRecaptureThatInnocenceOfLovedMissedPoembyLawrenceSPertillar,"To recapture that innocence of loved missed,
May be easier done by a poet doing it.
But when a poet isn't sitting to compose words of love...
The wish for it may be stronger than words can express.
Since words may touch emotions.
But to caress one's flesh...
In an anticipated mutual acceptance,
Is what the poet envisions as best.
For those who are poets,
In a loneliness desired to forget.
Or deny to mask in alibis.
And a poet can decide,
Whether to expose this or hide!
'So what have you chosen to do? '
Lie."

That life isn't perfect.

But she crawled out
Into the world everyone knew.
Things that once were.
Happiness once known;
The truth of it all.

That of a child;
So let my ageing vision be
Serene and mild.
The depth of folly, I aver,

In that dark pool of science where
Truth-demons sleep.
Let me not be a bearded sage
Seeing too clear;
In issues of the atom age
Man-doom I fear.
So long as living's outward show
To me is fair,
What lies behind I do not know,
And do not care.
Of woeful fears of future ill
That earth-folk haunt,
Let me, as radiant meadow rill,
Be ignorant.
Aye, though a sorry dunce I be
In learning's school,
Lord, marvellously make of me
Your Happy Fool!"

985,Emotion,InnocencePoemsBreachOfInnocenceTheRoadKillPoembySeemajoglekar,"One sunny noon, while chasing butterflies you &me,
Tried to unravel the mystery of the birds &the bees,
We stopped at some broken wings, lying on the ground, splattered,
Blackish red. To divert your attention I said,
“See! , There  goes a butterfly in your favorite color,
Pink petals above your head hover.”
But you didn’t move &stood there
Watching, the first sight of destruction &its dark face.
Asked me where the bird went if it lay at your feet
Tattered like your ragged doll, with no tweet,
Its feathers spread, its face vacant, so still, awake.
You asked me, “If it still lay there within”
“Why it lay there so dirty, muddied.”
“Why doesn’t God clean it up? It’s a poor small bird.”
Questions I have searched answers for an entire life,
Your innocence springs open the Pandora’s Box.
In detail we inspect & see the ants have a galore,
You said, ” Kill the ants they are at the bird’’,
I said; “It doesn’t matter, now God has forgotten, ”
Puzzled you look at me, unsure, unsafe, and no longer protected.
Worried you ask me again –“Then where did it go? ”
I pointed to the skies &said –“It is with God- Up there! ’’!
You said looking up —“ I don’t see- where? ’’
I said—“God is there but prefers to remain anonymous”
Then you ask –“Then how would you know who he is? ”
“You say he could be anywhere, here –there, ”
I said –“Yes, he is here, I see him in you—your sweet smile”
Again you give me that quizzical look
And with tender hands my arm you took.
We let it be & went ahead instead,
Me in my daily pursuits, you withheld
By the wonders of childhood. Our separate ways,
It’s been three summers now,
Even today when unwell you scream-“A feather in my bed! ”
And again the same question stands,
And stares at me-bold, daring, emphatic! .

986,Emotion,InnocencePoemsInnocenceAnAutobiographyPoembyShouvikRoy,"I don't know when I was born,
Maybe when humanity didn't exist.
I was lost, in the senses of the insentient beings;
Always trying to find something.
Then came the humans, and I found my worth.
I found my place in the stone man's child
And the warmth of the fire made,
Since then I am multiplied.
I am the newborn's cry and the old man's last grin;
The blue of the ocean, red of the fire;
Half Bent bough of the golden tree to the ground,
Yellow no more, I am coloured brown
Once the air smelled of me, and the soil whispered my name;
I was serenity, I was beauty;
But for years I was harmed
And my luster has happened to dim.
And then came the bullets
With their sharp faces drilling my reality;
I felt lonely, for no one remembered me,
Puffed with the grey smoke far I went
Now I doubt myself, have I ever existed?
But when that sudden qualm would arise
I would find myself in the smile of a mother
With her child, I am still alive…"
987,Emotion,InnocencePoemsInnocenceNeverDiesPoembyCPSharma,"Who says the Christ was crucified?
Who says the innocence ever died?
Christ just came to be our guide,
After the message he did hide.
Innocence is her Master’s bride,
Let your eyes be open wide;
San innocence life takes not stride,
San a villain the drama doesn’t glide.
Pleasures and pains are lighted fools,
They are just life’s drama’s tools;
Its stage is just a duality’s pool,
That is why Trinity our minds rule.
Nothing dies, nothing ever crucified,
The fault is with us, we are two eyed;
Unite with the One and ride your pride,
Let us be Radha, Lord Krishana’s bride.

To make love for the first time
Then you asked for my help

A friend from my teenage years
I was so naive and stunned

You cried, you begged, you pleaded
“But you are my life-long friend”

This had to be the end

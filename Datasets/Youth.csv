Proud, as proud can be,
For today, at the Barbican,
You’ve collected your Honour’s Degree.
A Degree in Graphic Design,
You’ve worked so hard to attain,
And the Standards you’ve set yourself,
Through Life, you should always maintain.
Put the Craft that you’ve learnt to good use,
Remember, put your Clients’ needs to the fore,
And then you will succeed in Life,
Dear Daughter, whom we do adore.
With Pride, we watched you receive

On this 29th November 2005 Tuesday.

1,Emotion,GraduationPoems8thGradeGraduationPoembySummerSong,"A puzzle together
a puzzle apart
each piece belongs to my heart
each piece is differant
each piece is great
But now they have to take on the long expected fate
They knew it would come
the day was here
the day they dreaded at the beginning of the year
The day they would be pulled apart
the whole would be broken
they knew it from the start
A piece here
and a piece there
how could life be so unfair
The beautiful picture the puzzle protrayed
is now forgotten
the pieces have strayed
They went away
fell beneath the wooden table
the puzzle would never again be stable
But that puzzle is forever in my heart
the memories of each piece
will never fall apart
-For my eighth grade class on graduation-"
2,Emotion,GraduationPoemsMohamudAtTheMosqueForMyStudentUponHisGraduationPoembySusanRich,"And some time later in the lingering
blaze of summer, in the first days
after September 11th you phoned –
if I don’t tell anyone my name I’ll
pass for an African American.
And suddenly, this seemed a sensible solution –
the best protection: to be a black man
born in America, more invisible than
Somalian, Muslim, asylum seeker –
Others stayed away that first Friday
but your uncle insisted that you pray.
How fortunes change so swiftly
I hear you say. And as you parallel
park across from the Tukwila
mosque, a young woman cries out –
her fears unfurling beside your battered car
go back where you came from!
You stand, both of you, dazzling there
in the mid-day light, her pavement
facing off along your parking strip.
You tell me she is only trying
to protect her lawn, her trees,
her untended heart – already
alarmed by its directive.
And when the neighborhood
policeman appears, asks
you, asks her, asks the others –
So what seems to be the problem
He actually expects an answer,
as if any of us could name it –
as if perhaps your prayers
chanted as this cop stands guard
watching over your windshield
during the entire service
might hold back the world
we did not want to know."
3,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationPoembyZubaidaBoland,"Graduation
Is it a a happy event
Or a sad one
Coz after what I've experienced today
It must be painful
Seeing my friends wave goodbye
Promising ourselves
Not to be separated by life
I hope this promise will never be broken
No matter where our dreams take us
No matter how many times life tries to separate us
We will always be great friends
Never strangers I hope
After the great times we've spent together
It was before that farewell moment
I felt so sad when I saw an empty class
I never thought this moment will ever come
I wanted a full one
Now when I think of graduation
The first thing that comes in my mind is
Who's gonna accept my selliness?
Who's gonna calm me down when I'm drowned in my hot tears?
Who's gonna tell me that everything's okay even though it's not
Dear  fellows,
Graduating is not all about school
But it is graduating from the life of teen age
Graduating from late childhood moments
To something more challenging
Something more fierce
But with the pictures we had in mind
Of those times
Of sharing a laugh
Will make it so much easier
The fact that we've been through a lot  and
These three years
Have made us stronger
It made us fighters
It shaped us into a HARD ROCK
so be proud of what we have done
Don't cry over spilt milk
After all, this life is a short journey
But we are doing our best to make it taste better
so now i can say
that graduation is a moment of a lifetime
in which we were transformed into ourselves."
4,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationALittleLongerPoembyDaniMarieJohnson,"Mmm I wanna linger
Mmm A little longer
Mmm A little longer here with you
Mmm It's such a perfect night
Mmm It doesn't seem quite right
Mmm That this is my last night with you.
Mmm Come September
Mmm We'll all remember
Mmm Our Central days and friendships true
Mmm And as the years go by
Mmm We'll all recall and sigh
Mmm This is goodnight and not goodbye"
5,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationDayPoembyKatieEvans,"The more I look back on all the happy times
the easier it is for me to realize
that friends are much more then hellos and goodbye
it all comes down to what you have inside.
Yes, some are good singers and some are athletic
but that doesnt matter (are you starting to get it?)
all that is important is the feeling inside
if your white or black or green or blue eyed.
For me to sit and say 'I wont miss this old place'
is wrong and untrue (cant you tell in my face?)
all the frinds and teachers meant so much to me
I dont know any place that i'd rather be.
'Those were the days', I'd here my parents say.
charish there years...each and everyday
The people you'll meet and the places you'll go
and the hurt once thats gone is more then you'll know.
All my friends will be leaving and i'll still be here
All my friends i'll be losing is my greatest fear
Promise you wont forget me as you go away,
promise you'll be back to see me someday!"

With feelings of accomplishments this day,
To bring you peace of mind and happiness
In every special way.
May the fond memories of school days
Glow warmly in your beloved heart
Where the cherished classmates
Will forever play a vital part.
May Graduation Day be extra special
With elaborate pomp and show,
May the procession of elated graduates
Create glee and parent faces to glow.
May the ceremony for conferring diplomas,
The cards and acknowledgements and flowers
Fill the day with pride and immense joy
And delightful and meaningful hours.
May those you love and respect surround you
To share your moments of glory this day,
May the accolades of Graduation Day
Come into your life to forever stay."

9,Emotion,GraduationPoemsCongratulateKellyOnYourGraduationFromDentalSchoolPoembyNHIENNGUYENMD,"Congratulate Kelly, on your graduation.
After four years of studies, you graduated from Dental school!
Now you have your license to practice
But you prefer more training in your sub-specialty.
You'll spend two more years in school
And you'll accumulate more astronomical debts!
This week, you made a trip to Philadelphia.
You visited new school with your mother and brother.
Next two years you will be a resident at Penn Dental school
To receive special training in orthodontics.
You'll pay expensive rent these years.
Fortunately, your classmate shares one half of the rent.
So now, you can put your mind to study hard.
Two years from now, you'll graduate from this ivy school to enter your practice.
Thank you for visiting me and your aunt.
As a small gift to you, this poem is our congratulations.

10,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationIsPoshPoembyEleanorLynar,"Go, Erik Go. You are walking in the spotlight of stars tonight, at County
College of Morris Twenty-eighth Commencement Celebration rite. How exhilarating your mother feels? Words fail to justify this night. But, my heart
overflows with pride, joy and radiant bliss, that I want to jump up and do the ""Twist."" Son, instead, I give you a bear hug and cheek kiss, which is better than a slipped disk.
Sniff, Sniff, mother weeps. I just remembered your baby years. It was so
hard loving you then. I worked dog tired; had little rest, while I tried to
do my very best. Everyday as I cradled you against my chest and watched you
suckle lying at rest, bonded superfluous strength to survive the Single
Parent Test and the stamina to do the rest.
Woo, Woo, Woo, mother shouts as Erik ascends the stage steps for his degree.
He smiles with glee and gives two ""Thumbs"" up to me. When he returns seated, I
congratulate him saying, ""My son, let 'God's Beacon' signal your pathway,
when an unexpected life wobble leave your mind in a boggle. Stay plugged into
life using positive discipline, diplomacy and tact. These are strategies that work, when golden opportunity explodes like sparkling fireworks.
Go, Go, Go, mother yells from her gut, as the ceremony ends; the happy class
leave walking, in a last unity strut. Erik's cap is pitched high into the sky,
outside. He is next to hop aboard the ""Opportunity Roller Coaster Ride."""
11,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationPoembyCarolynBrunelle,"Sudden changes in the weather
Has you trying to hold it together.
Is it outdoors or indoors?
No one knows anymore.
Will there be lightning and thunder?
Will graduation happen at all, you wonder.
But keep on practicing
Hold on to that dream
Take a deep breath;
Try not to scream.
It’s always going to be something
That is outside the norm,
Because LIFE is all about
How you deal with the storms.

12,Emotion,GraduationPoemsEternalGraduationPoembyVincentFeliciano,"Like children in fear
Of their innocence lost
We all dreamed our dreams
At unlimited cost
But the reality of our hopes
Always seemed to be in vain
Because the hands of desparation
Left no ground for us to gain
Never seeing a way out
Would only feed our frustration
Like a hungry naked man
In the face of humiliation
And to the height of any challenge
We refused to climb at all
Because our hearts were far removed
By the fear that we might fall
But today we are free
To be the souls of all our dreams
As the fabric of our desires
Are held firmly at the seams
For with patient endurance
We reached a brand new plateau
Where our dignity and pride
Could have a real chance to grow
So let our yesterday's fears
Be a long forgotten past
As we face up to the challenge
Of life's new unending tasks
Like the stretching hands of time
We may never reach an end
But at least now we have the means
To fight back...to defend
For there may come a time
When our names are less than words
Our thoughts are never known
And our speech never heard
But in the time we have been given
Let us not forget this day
Because the price it cost
To get this far
Was a price only you could pay."
13,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationDayPoembyRuthKuttler,"Today's the day we honor you, send love and blessings too.
Our prayers for you to know true joy through what you say and do.
Rejoice in your accomplishments for you have come so far,
A milestone and a victory that's brought you where you are.
And as you hold your head up high, embrace that scroll in hand,
Just hold that vision of the joy and honor where you stand.
For this exhilaration is the power that you'll find,
Propels and fuels the dreams you dream, the passions in your mind.
Those dreams can take you anywhere; believe that you can be
And settle not for getting by or mediocrity.
Enjoy and celebrate your day; remember as you go,
Your past and all your memories, the happiness you know.
Hold this treasure in your heart and walk with pride today.
Your road ahead has just begun; you'll soon be on your way.
A road that's filled with obstacles and opportunity;
Your choice to see what you will see, to be what you will be.
One door will close with scroll in hand, your gateway to begin;
With seeds to be a shining star whose time has come to win."

15,Emotion,GraduationPoemsOnYourGraduationDayPoembyMELVINBANGGOLLAY,"ON YOUR GRADUATION DAY
(To my child, Melly Rose)
Melvin Banggollay
The hurdle my child is not yet over
I said when we went to the stage together
On this special day you finished another
ladder of life as graduates like the others.
But as soon as we were on the stage
I felt how my loving father rejoiced
On this day I heared many adage
of distinguished student's   turmoils.
When I heared one of the graduates
Narrating the unselfish sacrifices
Of his father who died before he graduates
Teardrops fell like unbroken necklaces
As I behold how my own father radiates
a love so full with care full of traces.
When you gave me your diploma
As token of your great  sacrifices
My eyes was filled with sweet aroma
of  thousand flowers tenderness
as my eyes build a million aurora
For you didn't turned down my sacrifices
but nurtured them for your own success.
Congratulation dear beautiful child of mine
for doing what is best that can help you define
The future that lies ahead untill you can fine
destiny of your fate that your faith entwine.
Stand strong and never  surrender
As trials come in your way while you harbor
to define your own life amidst great strife
But have faith  and you can have a better life
and all things can happen with God's power
If faith unto Him your load and charger.

16,Emotion,GraduationPoemsLindsaysGraduationPoembyMarilynLott,"We were so proud of Lindsay
On her graduation day
She turned a fresh new corner
So much she had to say
For she had passed a milestone
What special memories
So beautiful and so talented
With wonderful qualities
Whatever she chose to do
We knew she’d do it well
Her family looked happily on
Full of pride, we could tell
Of course there are always
Bumps rising in the trail
But with Lindsay’s determination
How could she possibly fail?
It’s so wonderful to watch
Young people at their peak
So willing and so ready
For it’s knowledge that they seek
So we look at Lindsay’s pictures
We knew that she’d go far
Whatever direction she took
She’d be our special star!"

20,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationPoembyakingbehindanielmurphy,"Graduation Day is the climax of a
dream.
A parental dream that began
when a child is born,
And their hope come true it
would seem,
A triumph held after periods of
forlorn,
A feeling of pride and euphoria
years away
For a daughter or son -
Graduation Day.
It is a peak of success for the
graduate,
Not only for the graduate but
parents too.
A joyful event after many years
they had to wait,
Realizing the glorious thrill of a
dream come true,
A genuine smile accompanied by
a deep sigh,
Often a handkerchief in hand as
the class goes by.
Graduation is a deserving, hard
earned goal
With mortarboard and gown as
foretold,
A gratifying service of the mind
and soul
In a simple and beautiful
sheepskin told
That the graduate fulfilled the
educational rule.
At last, for the mother and father,
a dream come true.
Graduation Day!"

23,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationGrowingUpPoembyanaorozco,"Graduation is a huge step
Not only for you
Your friends and your family
Don’t know what to do.
Will you keep in touch?
Will you call them every day?
Or will all of their memories,
Simply fade away?
Graduation is adrenaline,
It gets the heart a racing
But your poor folks feel stressed,
Soon they’ll start the pacing.
But knowing you tells me that you will never forget
Your high school years you will never regret
I know…..
That you will call your family
You’ll let them know you’re okay.
Even if you feel like it’s been a shitty day
Your friends will be close by you will surely keep in touch
For simply letting go would be a deadly punch
You will be remembered, your greatness will remain
For you have never caused, aggression, hate, or pain.
I write this to you now to show you that I care,
And also that I’m glad that you are always there."
24,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationDayPoembyLawrenceSPertillar,"The moment it is realized,
A chip long carried on your shoulder
Has been dissolved...
A graduation has occurred.
And you have moved on.
It has dawned on you,
Bitterness that you knew...
Has gone!
It's graduation day!
And knowing you belong among
Those who can truthfully say they can forgive.
Is a blessing to have lived to learn,
That lesson!
So many have failed and given up.
They are the ones heard stuck...
Finding fault with everything.
And nothing within them is felt to give!
Those are the ones who live life,
Being right without insight!
And on the tips of their tongues,
Is a complaint about something or someone.
And what who did and how it was done...
To them.
They want the attention,
Although they don't listen!
And...
At some point in time,
Minds they have are left behind!
In affairs misunderstood with blame to claim."
25,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationDayPoembySrijaniMahanta,"As the years in our lives pass by,
We come closer to our lives so gatsby,
Yes, I am talking about graduation day,
A day filled with mixed feelings of our life's way,
A day so inspiring for some,
Yet so disheartening that it may make one feel completely gone,
But there is light at the end of the tunnel,
As we may notice some dreams of us bubble,
So let us not lose hope,
And instead work hard every other day,
To reach closer to our lives beautiful way,
And this will make our lives so bright and gay."
26,Emotion,GraduationPoemsLifeAfterGraduationPoembyJosephTRenaldi,"Graduates - go forth and think positively about the future,
Even though the world is an unpredictable place
With everyday conflicts and disputes hovering over you.
A right attitude will enable you to cope and face.
You are a part of a growing movement in society,
Your generation will accomplish monumental things,
You can be a part of this fabulous movement now
If you are willing to embrace it and see what life brings.
Graduates who have been able to adapt to change
Have survived the years of turmoil in the world today.
Don't be fearful of finding exciting things to accomplish?
Don't miss out on everything that is important along the way?
Each graduate is unique and want different things.
Now is the time to decide which direction you will go,
The time to decide what kind of person you want to be,
A person who is afraid of change or one curious to know.
There's going to come to a point in your life
When you will need to be embraced and comforted too.
Always have the courage to follow your heart and intuition
And put forth your best effort in everything you do.
Remember - there is life after graduation."
27,Emotion,GraduationPoemsAGraduationDayPoemAcrosticPoembyDorianPetersenPotter,"Happy Graduation Day to you!
At last you've completed this journey.
Preparing for a long time you've
Pursued what you've dreamed for and now
You are going on your way up
Greater things are waiting for you and
Really you are on your way now
And there's a more in the future for you to do and your
Dad and your mom must be very proud of you
Use your talents well and be the best you can be, remember
All that you have done to get where you're now
This is not the end but it's just the beginning for you so
Inspire others you meet on your way out to do the same and
Open the door of your heart and
Never quit dreaming but hold on tight to your hopes 'cause
Day after day there are more things to do and learn
And remember to be honest and true to you because...
You can make all your dreams come true one day too
Happy Graduation Day to you!

30,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationPoembyBernardFAsuncion,"The award of diploma
Is every student's desire;
It's like a sweet aroma
Aimed by heart's burning fire.
An acceptance of medal
Is an icing on the cake;
The day is very special,
A chance one must really take.
During many years in course,
Research and quizzes seem hard;
Results are better, not worse,
Bringing cool and sweet reward.
The speech in the occasion
Is awesomely inspiring;
Giving righteous direction,
Like what words of wisdom bring.
The teachers utter farewell,
So do the classmates and friends;
Goodbye and good luck they tell,
As the last day in school ends.

31,Emotion,GraduationPoemsHappyGraduationDayPoembyAntonioLiao,"I waited for too long, guarded with much expectation
swings my life through rise and fall, until I conquer the
one I adore, the might of the grade raises me to go in
the paper record I knew I can be strong, project, field
trips and test makes it all, wow! its a graduation
packages deal everybody is called
long live the teacher, in every lines they watch it fall, the
reason waking until dawn melted candles and eyebrows
in the table ants eat them all, as the student always pray
to pass making them luck in the end wisdom and fate
leads its way, laughter, jokes and smiling sway every day
for it’s the path to reach and catch every minutes and hour
of the day until the doorstep of the hall everybody love to
stay
mother and father watch as you walk in the pathways and
in the aisles you look like a baby as your smile in the
roof top, always make you happy, for graduation day your
friend and love one witness your beauty, just close and
breath as you could make it; the whole day is you to do
the best in you
see and reward the past, learn to vow the one you believe,
live the future and bring the past, know yourself forget the
wounded lies, be on guard the present is you to step, nay!
the future will come, for only the you is the one you adore
leave nothing that forget you, always be ready, only our love
will leads you in your way.....now go and Happy Graduation
Day.....in your life"
32,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationClassPoembyPradipChattopadhyay,"This is my graduation class
and I have bunked quite a few of them.
terrifyingly I realize it has to be a long time
for I am frantically looking for the college
the home of my graduation class
and here I am groping to get my way back
asking people the way to my college!
Must be my long absence playing tricks on my memory
but that hardly makes sense.
At last I find out the iron gate
from there a narrow passage shows flight of stairs
but my class, which floor is my class?
doesn't strike me the hush
as I run up the steps
wasn't it the fourth floor?
and when I reach it gasp for breath
my graduation class looks unfamiliar
so is the head stooping under the table lamp
his specs almost falling from nose
intently gazing at something
from the maze of electrical apparatuses spread before him.
I don't recollect having ever a teacher like him
but today I don't trust my memories
too many things I have forgotten
must be the fallout of missing classes for too long
the man there in my graduation class
has to be my teacher!
He looks up as I start speaking
I'm sorry sir, being ill I've missed some classes
but I'll manage to catch up.
Then it happens
my bag swings in the air
pulled by an invisible force!
He smiles at my awed face
don't bother, you know, it's so strong
the electromagnetic field of course
such nasty pulls they make
in a flash a floodgate opens
my graduation class doesn't have a lab inside
my bag by now flying in the air is an office bag
I have no business in the college anymore
I had left my graduation class
over three decades ago!"
33,Emotion,GraduationPoemsRememberingGraduationDayPoembyJosephTRenaldi,"We often live reminiscing the past
as another graduation day comes around.
Thoughts of our classmates and teachers
in our memory will always be found.
We remember the school days of yesteryear
and revel them with gentle care,
that once we knew when we were just
youngsters growing up without a dare.
Through the fleeting days of our education,
We built our agenda of many dreams
from elementary school to secondary school.
It was merely only a step it now seems.
We miss all the activities that once was ours
and the blessing that we were always free.
We live them over ever graduation day
with pleasant thoughts and glee.
Far too quickly the passing of time,
even though satisfying be the ways
that lure us back to yesteryear
to the events of other school days.
Though another graduation day shall end,
One goal for all graduates to hold,
May your education always bring good fortune
and happiness and success a hundred fold."
34,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationPoembyAHOSpeaks,"After many years of life and varied experience for me
I wish to leave a few words for you to record in your memory
Your about to embark on a journey that is paved with responsibility.
It matters not whether you are to continue your education or not
Be concious the next few years may not be exactly what you sought
Experience can be varied or routine but always given; believe it or  not
Responsibility and intent will be entwined for most of your actions
Be aware also that what you do, say and think, may be a quick reaction
What we do many time is not what was meant and needs a retraction.
The world can be your oyster and you can have your fill
.Life can be good or bad but rarely a bitter pill
The family is paramount and to destroy or seperate, is not God's will.
Every mind is precious and could hold the key
To open the door and  hopefully change history.
Time is not illusionary or taken out of turn
Who created our sun and set the parameters, so earth would not burn?
God gives us life, time, and most importantly light
The gift of a mind to recognize wrong acts from right.
The cause is not valid if the deeds are wrong
Nor is any act that removes life certainly does not belong.

would be everlasting in the indebted heart.
the joy and happiness on their faces,
would be engraved forever in thoughts.
Feel free, as we always wanted,
Aim for the rosy future, as we always dreamt of,
Be, as we were meant to be."
37,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationPoembySashaClaireBeckains,"Before, you were a child.
Trying to know everything
in the world.
Experiencing new things
and working out problems.
Making new friends everyday.
Always so energetic and
full of speed.
Loved to watch cartoons
on the weekends.
Would go places with your
parents.
Now...
Your all grown up.
Moving through life as if
being lifted into the sky.
Making your own decisions.
Learning good and bad,
and hanging out with friends
more often.
A lot more homework and
a lot more responsibilities.
Wanting your own way.
Falling in love, and getting
a job.
Then before you know it,
your already graduating.
The happy memories from
before stay with you.
The pictures of the past are
kept in your heart.
The soft graduation music
starts playing.
Then... it's time.
As you walk down the aisle,
beautifully dressed, you think,
my life as a young adult has
begun.
I wonder what lies ahead of
me as I go down the path.
Then, before you know it,
it's over.
Your nervousness has passed
and your finally moving on.
Soon to go anywhere you want to.
Soon to be independant.
Your whole world spins as you
try to think of the past.
The future confuses you,
but it's ok.
Your just flying through life."

Melvin Banggollay
Greetings to all our dear graduates
Who sipped education's bitterness
After many years of an ardent quest
At last, you behold flame of success.
Hail to all that excelled their best
To prove their worth in their interest
Unmindful of the trails and sacrifices
only to secure a future so bless.
Congratulation to all our dear parents
Who never failed in their promisses
To educate their children amidst all mess
But never surrendered to give the best.
But indeed, today is just the beginning
of a more ardous challenges unending
as you will be pushed forward seeking
opportunities with all your learnings.
Some may be lucky to land for a job
in line with their educational preparation
but some are prone or forced to just grab
Job totally strange to their education.
But be not afraid to sail beyond uncertainty
Paddling and roawing with tears in the way
For who knows just a distance not far away
Glitering smile of gold awaits you patiently."
39,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduation2005PoembyAdamFletcher,"As we look back,
At what we have done,
And at what we have completed thoroughly.
We finally see what we have accomplished,
And failed at to some degree.
As we look back,
And see our friends,
And how we have become a family.
We realize what we will miss,
Of the friendships that came to be.
As we look back,
and see our parents,
who never gave up or stopped believing,
they were here when we triumphed,
and here when we fell to our knees.
As we look back,
with all our friends,
And see all of the memories of our lives,
This is for everyone who is almost there,
It’s for the class of 2005."
40,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationDayPoembyJosephTRenaldi,"Graduation Day is the climax of a dream.
A parental dream that began when a child is born,
And their hope come true it would seem,
A triumph held after periods of forlorn,
A feeling of pride and euphoria years away
For a daughter or son - Graduation Day.
It is a peak of success for the graduate,
Not only for the graduate but parents too.
A joyful event after many years they had to wait,
Realizing the glorious thrill of a dream come true,
A genuine smile accompanied by a deep sigh,
Often a handkerchief in hand as the class goes by.
Graduation is a deserving, hard earned goal
With mortarboard and gown as foretold,
A gratifying service of the mind and soul
In a simple and beautiful sheepskin told
That the graduate fulfilled the educational rule.
At last, for the mother and father, a dream come true.
Graduation Day!"

A day supposed to be the happiest
The happiest at least in half a decade
And here on a molded parapet alone
Sat with visions blurred
And blinks with the speed of the clocks
It's graduation!
A day not as envisaged
With friends, love and family
In high praise and in great pride
In bliss and much merry
With fatted calves and drinks fizzy
It's graduation!
An end to a period of timelessness
In times of hunger and dreams unknown
In times of thirst and early wakes
Missions to accomplish in depths of stress
It's graduation!
A day that begins it all"
43,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationPoembyMeganChow,"Graduation...
It seems so long ago
That we were in kindergarten
Eight years ago.
Ending elementary school,
Going on to high school.
Many things have happened
I'll always remember them.
Our parents have stood by us all these years,
Encouraging us in love
And support.
I wish I could relive those moments...
But it is not to happen.
Use your time wisely...
You will treasure it."

i see that picture
her husband beside her and the

time mends everything
like a grafted branch of a tree
the leaves grew from buds
and soon
the flowers bloom giving its
sweet scent to the air
for everyone to smell
the force of life knows always
where to go what to do what to fill up
and when
no one notices anyhow
the smiles cover what once was very lacking...."

Done all you need. So stand and shine.

Set four long, hard years ago
To prove that you can last
In life’s commercial show.
But more than just that
You’ve experienced new places
In books and from chat
With exciting new faces.
And now you’re ready
To journey lonely paths
To give value, remain steady,
Facing recompense or wrath.
May God watch over you
And keep you in His toll
Strengthening the best in you
As you achieve your goal."

Today you will march together
to be watched by great crowd of parents,
relatives and friends; today you will

And today I watch you with great pride

And what better nation is there than America for Graduation,
Let's celebrate in any and every way.
Mom has the cake,
Lisa is two and wondering what wish you'll make,
This is a great day, and thank God it is not fake,
Although I wish that I could taste the snowflake that isn't here,
We will need a designated driver,
Because today is one day to drink at least a beer.
Today is a day to have no fear,
If I believed in hunting I would eat some deer.
I wish Marla could be here,
She was taken at a young age,
I wish Ladonna could be here,
She is one reason to race for every cure.
I am not going to look in the mirror,
That would give me an image looking back,
And I am never going to look back, that is a fact.
Note to readers: I am not a graduate yet, but this is just something that came to mind to write."

high school with honors, student government, being a well-rounded
young woman of sixteen.
Going on to college, a wonderful experience that she's sure to en-
joy exclusively, all graduates now seated below in the auditorium
at the Arizona State Fairgrounds where it's being held.
There were far too many family members and friends in attendance
here tonight, color guard starting off the commencement, national
anthem being played by a guitarist, one of the graduates.
Speeches given in several students native languages, welcoming
everyone tonight, a young girl singing solo along with the Camel-
back High School band.
A beautiful voice, outstanding spiritual song, a terrific singer,
who will be remembered long after graduation, now graduates are
standing one row at a time to go upon the stage to receive their
individual diplomas and awards.
Many students gathered in front of us, proud and happy to have now
graduated tonight, our Granddaughter being called upon the stage now,
as we are clapping and yelling for her.
So proud of her accomplishments, heart's swelling with pride and joy
to see her, our young Granddaughter now a beautiful young woman, step-
ping out of childhood with a smile and goals in her mind.
All of which we're sure she will achieve, looking forward to attending
her college graduation in four years, she wants to be a teacher and
educate young children, a task she will be more than qualified for in
life."
54,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationPartyPoembyDarleneWalsh,"A gentleman or so he seemed
A graduation present was his need
From me my cherry was his goal
Given his way he would have stole
That which is precious for me to save
Until my special wedding day
He kissed and asked, and I said no
He reached, he touched, and I said no
He pushed and grabbed, and I said no
He tried to force and I said no
He didn't stop and I said no
Then with my knee I did said NO
Now he is hurt and I should go
So all his cloths I gathered fast
Through the window they did pass
And past his friends must go his ass"
55,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationPoembySamSmith,"The more I look back on all the happy times
The easier it is for me to realize
That friends are much more then hellos and goodbyes
It all comes down to what you have inside.
Yes, some are good singers and some are athletic
But that doesn't matter (are you starting to get it?)
All that is important is the feeling inside
If your white or black or green or blue eyed.
For me to sit and say 'I wont miss this old place'
Is wrong and untrue (cant you tell it in my face?)
All the friends and teachers meant so much to me
I dont know any place that I'd rather be.
'Those were the days, ' I'd hear my parents say.
Charish their years...each and everyday
The people you'll meet and the places you'll go
And the hurt once thats gone is more then you'll know.
All my friends will be leaving and I''ll still be here
All my friends i'll be losing is my greatest fear
Promise you wont forget me as you go away,
Promise you'll be back to see me someday!"

57,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationDayPoembyCliffordVillaflores,"Four years may seem a fleeting moment
Leading towards a Commencement
Of highs, onwards to a new degree
Of lows to friends, a parting sorrow.
Moments endearing spent in school
Homeworks, thesis becoming a tool
Knowledge and learning- food for the soul
As graduation becomes a goal.
Looking back the early Freshman year
Made each classmate and friend so dear
Period of adjustment oh so hard
Oh, how College caught many off guard.
Then came Sophomore and Junior years
Drove so many several fears
Requirements of PASSING piling up
Doubling one's time, fixing the gap.
Then came SENIOR year, the FINAL stop
Practicum here and there, moving on
Seeing the light as the tunnel shone
Clearances accomplished now all gone.
Now as individuals marched and watched
I just can't help but shed a tear
Of moments spent in ups and downs
Of mixed emotions in getting the CROWN.
Congratulations.

58,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationDayPoembyLaurenHumphrey,"Memories float among the abyss,
As hearts smile with joy,
And cry with loneliness.
Although happiness prevails,
The sorrow lingers on.
People glow a new shade,
And life begins to take on new meaning.
The long speeches and the loud applause’s fill the void.
The joyful cheers and the bone crushing hugs subside the pain
Today is graduation day.
It is not an ending but a new beginning."

no resources only  family
and government I'm sick
luxury, the first thing I can do without
that means catfood with no cat
while titans of industry
continue to get  fat
Lucky am  I

I am very sad."
60,Emotion,GraduationPoemsTheGownOfGraduationPoembyAkhtarJawad,"No need to be confined in a net of knitted straws
no need to be afraid of lightning and thunders of the clouds
no need to hide behind the feathers of a mother bird
now you don't need the shoulders of a father bird.
The gown you wore is enough to protect you in the flights to come.
My daughter bird I know it's raining heavily
lightning and thunders of the clouds are frightening
but the gown is an umbrella against all evils of the clouds
ignoring the evils of the clouds be safe and secured
in the beautiful rains the clouds provide,
the pleasant winds will bounce back a little mild showers you need.
Beauty of rains is infinite and its threats are finite.
Now fly below the skies and pluck the twinkling diamonds.
We are here in the nest, the same old knitted net of straws.
Let us pay thanks to the kind and benevolent ancient light
filtered through the greenery of a tree
reflected and refracted that are still showing mini rainbows.
Forming a beam of shining dust particles of aging,
with a positive approach we can see even dust as a beauty.
Let us capture memories of incubating a beautiful egg
let us forget the fatigues of incubation,
and let us pay thanks to God who bestowed upon us
and gave us a right egg for incubation!"

62,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationFromALovePoemPoembyRICBASTASA,"perhaps it is true
too much love can kill
in love poems too
got much
and now reading another love poem
gives me goose bumps
sometimes i think
making the love poem
and another love poem simply shows
your having not loved much
and your being not loved in return
love more and even if unrequited love some more
get up from a loving fall
cure that bruise
mend that broken heart
love still even when the world has learned the art of
indifference and hate more than any other
takes time to learn to do this
to know that love is giving and giving and giving
and then
after years of this kind of loving and giving
you will experience what i had gone through
now the love poem doesn't tickle anymore
nature does
the waves of the sea caressed by the hands of twilight
the moon nesting on the marsh
the grasses all wet with dew
the clouds pregnant with the blows of the wind
the gentle rain falling on the roof tops
the geese on their v-flight
the fledgling jumping from the nest to learn to fly
you see, this is what i am engrossed in now.
a beautiful world that i have not described well enough."

to speakers addressing the graduates below,
to tales, excitement and joy shared.
and the face of proud parents set aglow.
A day when a graduate maybe a bit uneasy
and can't tolerate the end of an era anymore.
But, oh the merriment tucked inside -
Sweet memories of educational success and more.
A day when graduates have a flickering hope
and on their face they warmly portray -
peace to the heart, an inner glow.
and faith to enlighten the unknown way.
The heart leads back to struggles conquered,
making commencement such a memorable day.
Remembering the tears and convulsive sobs -
The pleasantries of school days will forever stay."

stage.
A castle drawbridge with banners flying above it, the backdrop
for the walkway soon to be walked upon by many outstanding students.
Announcements, Star Spangled Banner, Pledge of Allegiance, and noted
teachers making their speeches.
At last, students standing row by row, single file, waiting for
their names of distinction to be called.
An eternity goes by, then suddenly my son is standing, walking,
waiting to be called onto the imaginary red carpet, as he strides
proudly across the walkway suspended slightly in the air.
Then it happens, they call his name, mispronounce it, but my son
walks without any hesitation or break in stride, to receive his
diploma, his moment in the spotlight.
Tears in my eyes, I quietly clap with dignity for my son, I
couldn't be prouder, my love for him overflowing.
Such a joyous moment in the life of a Mother, there are no words
to express how proud I am of him.
This moment in time reminding me of past moments in his life when
I was proud to be his Mother.
And now, once again, he has touched my life with his achievement
and I can only say, so humbly, how very proud I am, to be his
Mother.

67,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationPostScriptPoembyEddieRoa,"When we got through our scholastic years
And have returned to youthful stomping grounds
Hello again to the sweet reality of being extramural
Relieved from reading tome upon heavy tome
Wanting in words to describe the relief the completion caused
From the rigors and hardships of a disciplined way of life
The august halls of the alma mater a prison now behind us
And the parchment scroll did seem irrelevant to our lives then
The college library had rude graffiti on its mottled walls
The carillon pealed from fractured bells tinny hymns
A heavy yellow pall spread clammily on the quadrangle
The dean was in disrespect, the faculty tainted, we were sure
But what of the mind, the nurturing of which, we
Unknowingly, surreptitiously had been honed to face
The challenges of a reality then far imagined
Clearing the muddled glasses of youthful views
Soon we realize that the years behind the ivied walls
Were not stones wasted and skimmed in an algae filled pond
Later as we mused and pondered complexities of existence
That would have stunned us dumb had we not persisted"

Graduation day is finally here.
Everybody’s so excited,
It’s the most important day of our young lives.
Some of us are scared,
We are being sent out into the world.
College isn’t like high school,
You’re friends won’t be there with you.
We don’t know what to expect,
Or if we will like college.
We will have to make new friends,
And deal with new bullies.
We may not even be sure what we want to do,
But we will try to make the best of it.
Some of us will stay with family while we are at college,
But others will go away.
Even though we won’t be where we are used to,
We can still have fun.
Graduating made us individuals,
No longer a group.
Now we hope the world can handle us,
Because here we come.
Ready to make our own spot in the world,
And not just in our families."
70,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationDayPoembyElenaPlotkin,"Putting on a gown,
Heading into town.
Taking place in line,
Parents sitting way behind.
Talking with some friends,
I probably won't see again.
Walking to my seat,
Staring at my feet.
Embarrassed by all the eyes,
Wondering where are the guys.
Twisting my neck,
Everyone out there is a speck.
Sitting down anxious to begin,
Patience running kind of thin.
Speeches lasting way too long,
Where's the old marching song?
Finally up and out of the chair.
Trying not to mess up my hair.
Staring at the back of a head,
Hearing the names called instead.
Finally mine has been said.
Wishing I never left my bed.
Walking to grab a rolled up paper,
Smiling in the direction of the sole clapper,
Hearing the shouts and laughter,
Shaking hands and posing after.
Walking back to the same chair?
Waiting to throw my cap in the air.
Up it goes in a drum of applause
We are definitely a lost cause.
Picking up my cap from the floor.
Heading out and saying bye,
I don't even remember that guy.
Finding my family and some friends
Posing for pics in front of the lens.
Closing my laptop and taking off my gown,
Maybe someday I'll head into town.
When life is far from a guarantee, Imagination must meet virtual reality.

To serve the sick;

And keep aflame the wick.

And so its challenges;
Ahead you charge;
Time will solve all problems.
And never forget
Your Alma Mater-
The place that made you
A Doctor.
And think awhile
About your teachers too;

Keep your Ethics,

74,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationPoembyMaryAngelaDouglas,"we'll heap gardenias on the stage
and sing together only the true songs
from the heart like a petal folded down
to mark this space, this transition
others made before us too.
and in the chapel of ourselves recall
the universe we studied the pale green halls and feel
one course finished, another yet to start and so we pause
like trembling stars in the early evening
and wait to play our part
seal off the exits that fear may not enter in this day
nor war nor sickness tragedy that bears so many away
too young. God make us sure in the way that we must go but now
hold us still in the rose bower of this hour
and let the spell be cast through mingled prayers and tears
that makes the fragrant moment last and last
beyond the felling of the years.

75,Emotion,GraduationPoemsTragedyAtGraduationPoembyGwendolynMiller,"A girl who is seventeen,
A girl who is Rory Gilmore,
A girl that walks with confidence,
A girl who always leaves the door open to endless possibility.
As enemies in high school,
Hatred ran through the veins of Jordyn Parker for me,
Jordyn and I both wanted to be lawyers,
I was accepted into Yale University, while Jordyn was not.
Chilton High School was the beginning of a tragic ending,
Only two valedictorians in the school,
I was one, Jordyn was the other,
The other chose to make herself absent.
A palace like structure was the place of Jordyn's disappearance,
All the lights were off in the building except for the auditorium,
The last time Jordyn was seen was at around 5: 00 p.m.,
The schedule was to begin at 7: 00 p.m.
Shock engulfed me leaving me helpless,
My heart began to beat faster and faster,
A silhouette could be seen in a room,
As I began to walk towards the room it too moved.
Graduation consumed my mind,
Graduation had consumed my mind for the past twelve years,
Where was she,
How could she not afford to not represent herself?
Jordyn passed away at 6: 55 p.m.,
All she needed was some direction,
Jealousy was the outline behind the sheet of actions,
In a letter she stated, 'the world is looking out for you.'
Tragedy at Graduation."

77,Emotion,GraduationPoemsYoungestGranddaughtersGraduationPoembyRoseAnnVShawiak,"This morning going to my Granddaughter's kindergarten graduation,
her little eyes and face lit up like a lantern, smiling beautifully,
running to give us a hug.
Going into the auditorium, sitting down, watching crowds of parents
and Grandparents storming in with younger kids and babies in tow, a
much bigger crowd than the school had expected.
Adding chairs and benches on either side of the bleachers to accomo-
date us all, kindergarteners sitting on the floor in front of us,
looking around, talking and waving.
Six kindergarten classes, a lot of children, picking my Granddaughter
out of them all, wearing a beautiful blue dress and white shoes with
a little heel.
Her brown hair flowing, a smile on her face, singing with her class
and performing all rhythmic motions, a totally wonderful experience
watching her graduate with honors and awards.
A blessed event in our family that will always be remembered in
pictures and this little poem written by her poetical Grandma, a
future treasure when I'm no longer here."
78,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationPoembyRaboSanusi,"Have never faced challenge so gross
Once was a thing to rejoice
But after experiencing the hardship
Presented to me by the outside world...
Can't seem to figure where my faith lye
It all started after graduation
Everyone sending their warmth kudos
Then, I felt like the greatest achiever
But years past still roaming the streets
In search for a better tomorrow
My name now a household example
Of the numerous jobless graduates
Just another figure added
To the long list of unemployed youths
With my jeans getting worn out
So also is my creativity in the labour market
The only exotic memory i have left
Is the hope of meeting my glorious colleagues…
On my way to the promise land
My acclaimed journey might be rough
But people are only interested in the brighter pix
Never knew this is what graduation is all about
Smiling faces as they all welcome you
After successful completion of studies...
Frowning faces after several months
Of scavenging for menial jobs
Quite had a lot of smile on my face before graduation
But now, the sole of my shoe explains it all
Discovered my talent on the rough edge of life
With this weapon called genius
I will triumph over failure
Wish to turn their gossip about my wretchedness
To that of the most accomplished graduate
Those who understand my cry
Should match along with me into stardom..."
79,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationDayPoembyGabriellDavis,"As you drive away
I wave goodbye,
And remember the times
We laughed and cried.
As you drive away
I slowly start to cry
And remember how much
You hurt me deep inside.
As you drive away
I’m filled with anger
Because you never said
You’re sorry for my pain.
As you drive away
I look my life
…And yours,
And I forgive you.
As you drive away
I wave goodbye
Then, stand and watch
And realize it graduation day
And nothing will ever be the same."
80,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationPoembyCrystalPierce,"Two years and I'll be gone.
Being a sophomore is rather boring.
I spend 5 of my seven classes snoring.
It's kinda weird to think that in two years,
just two school years, I'll be facing my fears.
I'm gonna graduate with a mediocre college degree.
This is how my school years will end for me.
I'm smart enough to pass
but to slow to grasp.
I can play quite a few instruments, that could help.
And at least I haven't failed.
It's gonna be different living on my own."
81,Emotion,GraduationPoemsHighSchoolGraduationPoembyRoseAnnVShawiak,"Sun setting before us, blazing gently against our eyes,
multitudes sitting, awaiting their son's and daughter's
graduation.
Excitement seeps between people, permeating the atmosphere,
quiet murmuring floating about the evening sky.
Down below us, folding chairs timidly standing upright on
the grass, waiting emptily for the teenagers who will soon
pass another milestone in their lives.
High School band, sitting quietly, bouncing notes and tunes
about their heads.
Creeping silently into view, red and white caps and gowns
grow below us, pride sits silently in our eyes, soon to flow
in the form of joyous tears.
Faculty filing in, taking their seats of ready achievement,
as silence filters through the crowd, allowing the speaker
his voice of congratulations.
Watching the procession file in with their caps circling
their heads, looking up and out, clouds can be seen circling
the heavens also.
As the sun continues to set on the far horizon, our son's
and daughter's lives are also setting on their futures,
gratuitous clapping for faculty and band quickly over, thank
God!
Hopes and dreams, tender and innocent fill the air as graduates
speak words, not knowing they are only beginnings of volumes
yet to come.
Forever young, the theme tonight, holds a thread which wishes
to stay forever, yet tomorrow will be forgotten.
Not on purpose is it ever done, age and years just seem to cover
over the dreams of the young.
Painted colors in the sky mix and blend, beginning to match
the colors of the caps and gowns worn below us on the football
field.
Voices ringing loudly, singing the Alma Mater to all, as
darkness swells and curls around us sitting in the bleachers,
yet lights shine down, reflecting on the graduating class.
The lives of many children wait breathlessly on edges of their futures, clinging ever so slightly to their pasts.
Musical words blast their way to our hearts, maybe a crumb or
note or two may remain for all ages, our future sons and
daughters remaining in our minds forever young.
Happiness fills the graduates as they receive their diplomas,
glee stands out for all of us to hear and see.
Riotous applause surrounds the sky as each diploma is handed
to a student, graduation being almost completed.
Mechanics of this graduation are over as the tassels are put
from left to right on every student's cap."
82,Emotion,GraduationPoemsTheGiftOfGraduationPoembyJosephTRenaldi,"The path of life before them lies
as elated graduates take stride.
Parents' eyes focused on their footsteps
as they listen to ceremonial music with pride.
Graduates know not yet their future.
They only know they will hopefully soar..
These graduates, a product of a school
that they now will cherish even more.
Parents watch as a son/daughter embarks on life,
their endeavors and what they will be.
They wait for days with an anxious wonderment,
A graduates future long to see.
One should appreciate the gift of graduation,
and wisely choose an occupation or professional plan,
For in the end, a graduate will mighty be,
but now must rest in another hand."
83,Emotion,GraduationPoemsTheGraduationDressPoembyEdgarAlbertGuest,"I'M not kicking on expenses, now the sewing time commences,
I will buy chiffon and laces till they say they've got enough;
Sure her dress for graduation shall excite the admiration
Of the masses who behold her; it shall be the finest stuff.
She shall even carry roses, when her high school training closes,
For she's worthy of the finest that there is in all the town;
But I sometimes sit and ponder of the days away off yonder
When her mother graduated in a simple gingham gown.
I have watched the fuss and bustle, and this ceaseless rush and hustle,
And I've listened to the planning of this graduation dress,
And I know when all is ended, she will make a picture splendid,
And I wouldn't be contented if she didn't, I confess.
But I still recall the other glorious picture of her mother,
With her cheeks as pink as peaches and her hair a golden brown,
As I gazed at her enraptured, and my heart, I know, she captured
On the day she graduated in her simple gingham gown.
I'd be laughed down if I said it, in such matters they don't credit
Me with knowing what is really very swell;
I can picture now their faces, if instead of silk and laces,
My preference for gingham, I should tell.
But with me it's grown a passion, and in spite of style and fashion,
And what women folks think needful, I insist and write it down,
I shall never see another quite so charming as her mother
On the day she graduated in her simple gingham gown."
84,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationDayPoembyAiyannaOrtiz,"Twelve years we have worked for this
day after day, year after year
Teachers filled are head with knowledge
most encouraged us to dream big
but our dreams can only be accomplished is
if we put our mind to it to make a better life for ourselves
no one is going to just hand you your delploma we most
work for it
the harder you work the easyer is it in the end
we work our butts off for twelve years
to wear a cap and gown and to walk across the stage
don't screw it up now!"
85,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationDayPoembyNatashaMaginleyFrancis,"Graduation day
Today is our graduation
And we are leaving all our friends
But this is just a start for us
For a journey that never ends
We will miss our pre-school
And all our teachers too
Who always made such a fuss!

86,Emotion,GraduationPoemsTheGraduationPoembyGangadharannairPulingat,"Graduation, an aspiration
An empowerment and a pathfinder
Where a bright future one can expect
With lot of hopes, and much efforts
The great universities, colleges
The studies, assignments, and all
Graduation, the parent's concern
On their little ones future
Their own life ambitions, all included
The books, periodicals, charts
The computer skills, the libraries
The mind wandering with all materials
Beautiful concern for knowledge."

screaming like goats
but he was warned
by the flash
on the ceiling
when they opened
their car doors.
Their feet were heavy
on the flat stones.
Glass smashed
dangerously inward.
He thought, 'I think,
therefore...' he ran.
Above the city,
universes sparkled
in the cold, black air.
Crouching in a red shadow,

89,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationPoembyHayleyK,"It's coming,
I can feel it.
Rushing at me,
like a tidal wave.
Soon,
free and independent.
I'll start a new story,
leave the old one behind.
Bring my favorite chapters with me,
leave the others alone.
When it comes then goes, I'll begin wondering,
what I'll do when I'm older.
I'll be happy it's finally over, until,
I'm realizing I'm crying,
my tears coming from the part of me who doesn't want to let go.
That doesn't want to leave behind all that's surrounded it for years,
But then, I'll remember all that's ahead of me,
an untold story waiting to be written still.
So, with a heavy heart, I'll move on,
Take my huge last step to the end,
and take my first step into my new beginning.
And experience a day,
my day,
called graduation."
90,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationPoembyLaurenLove,"We have been here for years,
And now it’s time to go.
We all have our fears,
Like having to mow.
We will go our separate ways,
But will be forever friends.
Our lives is like a maze,
And will never end.
We’re off to high school,
We’re big kids now.
And we are cool,
Even if we bow."
91,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationDayPoembyYuvaraniSami,"Graduation day
Is a long awaited day
For both parents and the graduate
Graduation day
Is a day of dream come true
The dream of parents since the child has born.
The joy and the pride
The parents feelings would be wordless.
All their effort to provide their children
With the best has been successfully
Fulfilled and paid off.
It is a climax day of a graduate
All the faces will be bright with smiles
Hands will be holding tissues
To wipe away
Tears of joy will be flowing
The graduate will be showered
With bouquets of flowers
Well wishes and best wishes
A day to be remembered now and then."
92,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationPoembyPINONDANGSITUMEANG,"Six years have past
You finally done last
This is the beginning not the last
Keep walking fast
Till next graduation of class
My heart was filled with sweet Alleluya
Of thousand of red roses aroma
When you saw me your diploma
You didn't turn down the sacrifices of your mama
We proud of you Antonia
Stay strong never surrender
All thing happend with God power
Never stop say a prayer
Faith unto Him forever"

knowing it is the last time,
Empty rooms where we sat the last four years,
empty lockers where books were kept,
Walks down and across the stage into a new life,
no more bells-early mornings- or being late,
A new life awaits, won't wait forever,
live life the way it was designed,"
95,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationDayPoembyillinoishaze,"White highlighted by purple and gold
upon our arrival, we nervously walked through the threshold
her arm safely secured
the couple that would never be
every glance down the aisle
greeted with a smile
it meant so much to me
procession drags on
with haint of praise
narrated by nastalgic songs
parchment recieved with pride
a bitter signature on a note
tha bares goodbyes
with a flash
my progress is cemented in time
The fire is in us tonight
Applause shows thier respect
whats next for us?
my graduating class
relief settles in, with words of love
to much crying
never enough hugs
I saw her
I heard her words
and met them with an embrace
choked up
the words bled sincerity and truth
my chin on her shoulder
arms wrapped around tight
'I love you'
hands down
that long awaited beauty
made my night
hesitation was key
I replied
never mocking
I hope she believed me
the after math
was filled with ash
my freinds ahd fire in thier lungs
the dramitic lives
and the pride of the young
the fire blazed
high and well
speech flowed
'we gave em hell'
separation was not a notion
all we have
is what we left
milestones and broken homes
senceless acts of innocents
trials by fire
drama and laugh
hold to it
live, learn from it
we cant get it back"

97,Emotion,GraduationPoemsGraduationDayJuly292007PoembycyclopsevenRam,"A day to part
Away from scholarly books
And mind boggling journals
Running words and trawling letters
Leaving behind the assignments
And examinations.
Graduation day
A fulfillment of recognition
Granted to measure the tough journey
Traveled in months and years
Browsing pages of papers
Now, insignificantly lie somewhere.
The sleepless nights
The restless moments
All have vanished with the crown
Received on this day.
A lot of happy smiles
And tears exchanged
During these periods,
But all joined together
To commemorate the hardship endured
To beat many through the journey
And come out the best among many.
The fear of losing the battle
And the agony of anticipation
Are all but flimsy tattles
Of this illusive mind
But never mind
There are no exams to mind, anymore,
at least for sometime.
Be ready to climb one more ladder
Make it your priceless ambition.
I wish you all the best, buddy

We shall climb higher and look further
We're leaving our salad days behind
and start chasing our dreams ahead
Give an embrace to the unknown future

Lift our head and spread our wings
To touch the sky and reach the stars
The moments we spent together
The memories I'll always hold dear
Would it take long to recognise me
If we happened to meet after years?"

We'll remember it forever, this everlasting moment.

Your wishy-washy ideas are quite antique
Can't you follow what is in chic?
She yanked me close and then you REEK!

She had no control over her beak
I kept on listening because I was meek
And she knew not what I lost what I seek"

To meet my teachers and friends
Saw what i never had seen in their

A chapel was built in the ground
Additional constructions were in that.
Never think it could turned like this

Whare i saw my teacher Helda in the chapel
She prays not for her but for the dears
She is the lady of honour not only in the age
With her good heart too..."
103,Emotion,TeacherPoemsFascinatedAndMotivatedByAnEnglishTeacherPoembyConnieWebb,"He was my instructor
In a college English class.
His stories took us to Italy
And the way women cry
At funerals.
To New York City
And the way homeless people
Walk with the best dressed ones.
Where the sound of
“Help he stole my purse”
Is heard frequently throughout the day.
To France where he enjoyed sitting at Cafés
Watching well dressed French women talk
Enjoying a language other than his own.
He told us of his joy of going to countries
Where he didn’t know that language very well
Just for some relaxation
Because as an English teacher
He was always listening to whether a person
Slaughtered the language or not.
In a foreign country
He didn’t have that problem
He could just be himself
Not a teacher looking for words
You left out, didn’t put in
Or used improperly.
It wasn’t that he was feeling superior to you
When he spotted your misuse of words.
It was that he wanted to sit down with you
And teach you exactly how to
Put your words on paper
So they would come out the best way they could.
Some people didn’t understand that
And really didn’t like him for his
Constructive criticism.
But I understood
Being always grateful
For his input
Even after my breakdown
When he said my writing was like
A Third graders.
He told me that he only wanted to help me
He didn’t normally take time with people
Who didn’t care about their writing.
He knew I cared
So he challenged me
To do better
Draft after draft.
He said he liked what I had to say
I just needed to say it better
And I was healed from my breakdown
After he said that.
Each time I hear him speak now
Or listen to a poem he reads
I am captivated again
By the way he strings words
To tell stories with meaning
Hoping that one day
I could be even half as
Good as him
With my words."

An occupation of worthiness,
An occupation of respect.
Teacher, a person who tells us everything
A student who wants to learn with him, everything
He knows very well about our future,
We could succeed if we have a devoted teacher,
We try to hide the dreadful things which we come across,
But the teacher knows everything, what is the matter all a 	propos…
He has a loving heart, and pardons us whatever we do.
So kind he is, and tell all the important what we are about to 	do.
Students try to touchier the teacher, and think we could get 	away,
A teacher is our parent, and is the key of heavens gate…!
I disgraced my teacher, so sorry what I did to him
Please forgive me, as a student I can’t study without him!

108,Emotion,TeacherPoemsHomeIsTheFirstSchoolAndMotherIsTheFirstTeacherPoembyMazidSKaziINDIA,"Home is the first school and mother is the first teacher.
Parents are the builder of children's characters and minds.
The mother won't be a fighter but should be a well preacher.
If she is an illiterate she must carry her children to tuition.
Howsoever the mother should educate their children first.
And she should send her children to school daily and regularly.
Teachers are not blamed not to fulfil children's educational thirst.
Both the parents and teachers should make them the best citizens.
As we can't work with one hand likewise we can't walk with one leg.
Hence, parents and teachers are the same faces of the same coin.
If parents and teachers do them careless they suffer in life to beg.
Do well and have well it is said to see your own profit in life or ruin.
That is why parents and teachers are the best artists of the child.
If an art is spoilt the statue of the child looks like an ugly and a wild."

110,Emotion,TeacherPoemsForMyHistoryTeacherPoembyAishaSherazi,"I’m sitting in class,
My eyes about to close,
I hope teacher don’t see,
I hope she don’t see me.
Bored out of my mind,
Falling so behind,
Cannot concentrate,
I came to class too late.
Although I was on time,
My body was I mean,
My mind is still outside,
From class trying to hide.
What does all this mean?
I haven’t used it yet,
How can I retain it,
When already I forget?
And then she walks over,
That teacher of mine,
A smile in her eyes,
A gentle one at that,
She puts her hand on me,
And sets me kind of free.
Now here I am in class,
Learning about the past,
About history,
And what it did for me.
How we can learn,
From mistakes of old,
Of people so different,
Some so very bold.
Some stood against oppression,
Some stood against the wrong,
Some said it with dignity,
Some said it with a song.
I owe it to them,
And teacher here to hear,
What they did for us,
And no longer fear.
That knowledge is so dull,
No longer hurts my brain,
No longer hurts my skull,
It will surely keep me sane.
The past is the future,
Unless I stay awake,
So I can benefit,
There’s much more at stake.
Than I thought before,
Before I got to class,
Thank you History  teacher,
For bringing to life the past.
I never got bored in History class, because I had a wonderful History Teacher.  This is for her."
111,Emotion,TeacherPoemsTheTeacherPoembyMichaelShepherd,"I wish I’d known him better.
But our respect for him was such
that you only spoke to him
when you needed to.
In a way, that was to know him truly.
You wouldn’t notice him, passing him
in a crowd; and yet, two paces on,
and you’d feel you had just passed
someone who walked in their own space
and left space itself quite unaffected.
To meet him, in the corridor, say,
early in the morning, was - what? -
awesome, refreshing, vitalising:
there was a sense that overnight,
he’d dived into some deep ocean
of sheer bliss; and emerged
like a morning seashore,
washed with freshness,
full of deep thought,
and his eyes
full of an understanding kindness
which stayed with you all the day.
What was extraordinary – of the many
things about this gloriously ordinary man -
was that although no-one ever saw him
looking at his watch, he was always
in the right place, and at just the right time,
yet never in a hurry – almost as if
he had some satellite navigation system built in.
And he always looked so genuinely pleased to be
just where he was. I don't think his facial muscles
knew how to pretend..
And so this spread to all of us around him –
and of course, he never  put this into words;
yet love surrounded him; and we just loved
to work with him. Though there were some, new to him,
who could barely handle such goodness
when they met it – wanted to challenge it,
find some reason to pick holes
in such perfection, although it was
unboasted. But these, he seemed
to know instinctively, and why they were
just as they were; one day, he and they
would be involved in some unusual and difficult situation –
even on occasion, dangerous -
and they’d be friends with him for life.
It was said by those who had known him well in earlier years
that extraordinary and miraculous things
happened to him – visions, angels, future things revealed,
revelations of some law beyond all laws;
we never talked of this; the story was
that when one older friend had questioned him of this,
he’d said, he always knew it would in time
be what he needed to pass on to others.
And there the matter rested.
I’d say, for me, for life
he redefined the nature of true love.

113,Emotion,TeacherPoemsMySilentTeacherPoembyMrsCynosure,"I again try to write for him
To tell him how I feel
And again my thoughts just fall off the page
None of the poetic leaves of my tree
Of feeling for him come back into play when
The pen hits the paper
He says I stroke his confidence
He will one day pin mine down
As the stars were playing tag team with my eyes
He was with my heart
Looking deep in to my heart
Looking deep in to my soul
Through the sexy curves of the letter O
For being so far away that’s all we have for now
In he’s charming poetic way he tells me that he cares for me
Oh yes from now until forever
The forever that’s beyond the sea
Beyond the ears can hear
And beyond the heart can break
I will care for him
So different from the others
They just wanna use me as their toy or for their joy
They just make me cry
Take advantage of my great desire and deceive my young mind
To get what they want
Not him
He is the one that calls me his princess
He is the one that has cute nick names for me
That makes me smile
Within his clever words
The feeling of I’m high starts in my eyes
The smile emerges on my face
The butterflies try to charge though my stomach
The need the desire becomes so great for him
He is my silent teacher
Teaches me what’s right and
What’s ever so wrong without even a sound
He will teach me so many things I’m sure of it
Things of mystery that I already know and
Some that are still a mystery to me
For he is my silent teacher
Waiting to fill me up with his hard and thrusting knowledge
And I am willing to take all of it in
Many times a day"

115,Emotion,TeacherPoemsTheCoolestTeacherIEverKnewPoembyAlisonCassidy,"Pat was the coolest teacher I ever knew.
My kids adored him.
He hated hypocrisy
and cant.
Pat loved kids.
Had two of his own
and a wife called Jan
whom he didn't like much.
Actually Pat didn't like ANY grown ups
very much.
He was belligerently left wing
(got into politics later)
Hated injustice
and most grown ups.
He used word conversations
to teach kids to read.
Let them use rude words too -
like bum and fart.
First time I saw him
he was covered with kids -
reading Mr Silly on the old couch.
He had a curly beard,
long hair tied in a rubber band
and blue eyes that really twinkled.
When he took the kids
to the local oval to play cricket
he always guaranteed a draw.
Said no one should take sport
too seriously.
Pat was the coolest teacher I ever knew.
My kids adored him.
He hated hypocrisy
and cant.
Some people said he was rude
(I suppose he was) ."
116,Emotion,TeacherPoemsMyTeacherMyHeroPoembyGeneenMeyers,"Each one has an important part
They guided us all the way
Each one has a place in my heart
For being there each day
Good role models to everyone
You never stopped believing
When we're sorry for what we've done
They are always so forgiving
When there's something we can't understand
They never stopped trying
Always ready to lend a hand
To help keep us from falling
Thank you teachers, you're always there
Every time I needed a friend
I enjoy the moments we share
I hope our moments would never end
Dear teachers, so sweet and kind
Look how fast the time has fly
Teachers like you I shall never find
But I will never say goodbye"

A good teacher is positively optimistic
A bad teacher swears all the time
A good teacher cares in their prime
A bad teacher passes on rude fear
A good teacher has on good ears
A bad teacher discourages

A bad teacher despairs
A good teacher prepares

A good teacher sets students on the right track
A bad teacher feeds on their looks
A good teachers reads many books
A bad teacher sings along with wrong faults
A good teacher brings along the right results

120,Emotion,TeacherPoemsDefyingTheEnglishTeacherPoembyDanBrown,"The best possible words,
with the best possible meaning,
in the best possible order,
with the best possible structure,
in the best possible way.
That’s what I was once told poetry is.
But I pushed those boundaries,
and wrote in many different ways.
We should do poetry our own way,
no matter what anyone says."
121,Emotion,TeacherPoemsTheSupplyTeacherPoembyAllanAhlberg,"Here's the rule for what to do
If ever your teacher has the flu
Or for some other reason takes to her bed
And a different teacher comes instead
When the visiting teacher hangs up her hat
Writes the date on the board, does this or that
Always remember, you have to say this,
OUR teacher never does that, Miss!
When you want to change places or wander about
Or feel like getting the guinea pig out
Never forget, the message is this,
OUR teacher always lets us, Miss!
Then, when your teacher returns next day
And complains about the paint or clay
Remember these words, you just say this:
That OTHER teacher told us to, Miss!"
122,Emotion,TeacherPoemsSonnetATeacherPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"I loved to be a Medical-Teacher;
My Teacher Father was my role model;
His scholarliness was his great feature;
His greatness words can never truly tell.
A Teacher tells whatever, he has known;
And moulds the conduct, character of wards;
He guides his pupils like his very own;
And expects never earthly just rewards.
A Teacher stays a Teacher forever;
None can replace his place uniquely held;
His students must be brighter and clever,
And when that happens, he is much reveled.
The students imbibe Teacher's noble thought;
To hand the same to progeny, they ought."
123,Emotion,TeacherPoemsANotableTeacherExperiencePoembySusanTAparejo,"A new day to face many eyes,
Such inquisitive look  never lies,
The brain increases in sight,
Cracking almost to its size,
To address these minds,
To let them believe their not blinds,
To the wits I transfer in their kinds.
I lost my goal and find no more,
To reason is not a solution,
I found no trace to turn my track,
They carry me from the start,
Out  form the destiny I plot,
I struggle myself to stood still,
Clang my feet to where I stood.
A force to full me down seemed increased.
The glaring  sight of co- teachers move,
Commanding  them to pull me hard,
Shocked shaken me to the truth,
A snakes emerged even in the town,
Where concrete pathways ever exist.
The  more I wounded the more I was braver,
The scenario turned into a showdown,
A learner flashed a glaring knife,
My womb was the target of sharpness,
I closed my eyes to subdue to God,
Pray a little and asked salvation,
to Him I submit everything.
As the flying sharpness come near,
I saw the darkness overtook me,
I shouted unintimidating voice,
To melt the fire of burning desire,
Those co teachers dropped  their lids,
As the knife dropped,
So did their joy of seeing me free,
A lesson I ponder before
And I ponder more and more,
to water me into the field of
A good teacher to live forever."
124,Emotion,TeacherPoemsTheNewTeacherPoembyRICBASTASA,"he prides himself about
this job
where he is all wise
and his students listen
he drives the points
like he's the hammer to
his nails
somehow the old teacher
listens
it is not supposed to
be
he picks a snail
a house actually where the hermit
crab lives
he whistles and the crab comes
out
learning the song of the
master
the wind, soft as breeze
the openness like the wide gate
of the morning sun
between the breasts of the hills"
125,Emotion,TeacherPoemsTeacherPoembyMarkRSlaughter,"The teacher taught;
The pupils never bought the notion.
Now distraught, he
Slammed the door,
Stomped the floor,
Seeing red.
The noise, the
Whole commotion,
Brought the Head.
‘You need your bed - you're full o' drink! '
He boomed.
‘Cripes! ' the teacher cried
- A stink of booze across the room -
‘You mean that I'm denied
My nightly bottle, comfy whisky?
I'll have to throttle naughty you.
Risky, true -
To see you dead! '
By now the kids had left the room -
Smoking - drunk - singing in the bogs.
‘Annoying little dogs! ' Our teacher screamed,
Dropping the Head -
His face completely cyanotic,
The situation now chaotic.
‘Now that'll do, ' the teacher laughed.
‘I might be daft, but I'm alive
To preach again - surviving those vicissitudes of life:
The challenges; laying down the
Lessons to the brats -
I'm the boss, they're the rats! Give ‘em strife!
I'll make ‘em take exams
Throughout the night - what a fright
They'll have. But first I'll round ‘em up to
To shift the Head.'
They dumped him in the garden shed
Behind the mower
And other paraphernalia
Used to keep the grounds in order.
The kids were good - no disorder
While they did the master's evil deed.
The teacher smiled; he'd been freed
From persecution, diminution
Of his rank: a lowly grade of scholar.
‘Thank you, pupils, what an honour,
Now the Head has gone,
But now I have to see to your
Extinction too.  After all, you
Never listen - never do!
And so it's time for you to earn
A just reward - a trip to Hell! '
However, the kids were luckily saved -
Yes, you guessed - the clanging bell that
Ended period two. Depraved and
Sweating like a pig, the teacher
Froze - took a swig anew of gin -
The Deputy Head was coming over:
Teacher had to wipe him out
As well!
The pupils took advantage: scampered,
Screaming.
Finely poised, the Deputy
Crooned: ‘What's the meaning, Teacher-?
And where's the Head, suspicious creature?
Answers came from Teacher's cane -
The heavy-duty rod was in attack -
Poor old Deputy staggered back -
A massive blow had bruised him badly.
Sadly, as he fell, he bashed his skull
Upon the ground - and that is where
The janitor found his body -
What a sight - pitifully shoddy!
But then the pupils cottoned on:
Should they call upon the staff
To see the teacher one-to-one,
The kids would end up having fun,
Since all the school would have to close,
As all the staff would come to blows with
Psycho-Sam -
The name the kids had given to this
Strange demented man.
So that is what they did -
The faculty, sequentially,
Exterminated;
The kids were rid of staff and
Free to roam, though
The teacher lost all interest and
Drove himself back home.
Knocking back a litre bottle of gin, he
Sung a song about the sin
Committed - emitting a din -
And what grin - hideous!
He even wondered where he'd been
Upon that brutal day.
Back at school, in disarray,
The kids were happily psyched again,
Smoking funny cigs, or eyeing adult flicks -
It's how they got their kicks!
At least they weren't a bane
To any staff -
What a laugh!

126,Emotion,TeacherPoemsMyFirstTeacherPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"They say the years from one to five,
when tiny tots become alive,
li'l professors they are, really
as they take in and store so freely
an overload of information,
as if by heaven-sent dictation.
Those years of active acquisition
are followed by the earnest mission
of teachers in the local school
who teach even the dumbest fool.
And, if you want to know the reason
why some of us learn out of season,
continue to obtain the goods
about the why's and what's and should's,
in playgrounds and on dusty streets.
It's when your hungry, blue eye  meets
that of the teacher  to connect.
In a split second a direct
and lasting bond is herewith born.
And from that moment you are torn
between the world and your first love
when she regards you from above.
But if no spark arises there
the two of you will never share
a common path through those first years,
and when your graduation nears,
you'll say good bye with no regret,
as cool as on the day you met.
For those who do feel adoration,
in early years a fair sensation,
you will increase your own IQ
because you understand the true
sweet essence of your little mind.
You learn to count, to write and find
that teacher's eyes are your reward.
When other pupils do act bored
you whip your mental faculties
for one good reason, it's to please
the one who does appreciate
your intellect in a debate.
You learn a trillion silly facts
about strange wars and secret pacts.
And, in the end, when you're all grown
it is as if you'd always known.
Your parents spend with you their days,
but seldom shower you with praise.
You learn for life, say those who know,
not for the school system, oh no.
But mine was such a lovely creature,
I did my thing just for the teacher."
127,Emotion,TeacherPoemsYouAreMyTeacherPoembyAntoinetteKopperfield,"If I should meet you
on the dusty road of life
Do not despair
for I am your teacher
If you should stumble
while crossing my muddy path
Do not despair
for you are my teacher
If we should cry alone
and falter in hurricane winds
Do not despair
for they are our teachers
If our souls should meet again
with tattered and worn-out shoes
Do not despair
for we have not learned"
128,Emotion,TeacherPoemsNoTeacherPleasePoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"Teacher, teacher, teacher,
you don't be a preacher,
and never be a searcher,
I will become a researcher,
Madame always I mischief,
Still, you give relief,
Never you have punished,
If work not finished,
Class, always I miss,
Make I noise hiss,
I get up and ask miss,
Making nuisance for a piss,
You still not get angry,
Allow me to go if feel hungry,
I have a good rapport,
With your full support,
The whole day I play,
Mingle with dirt and also clay,
Still, I pass it as a good day,
No lessons are done and books at bay,
I will be clever and also naughty,
But never I trouble when feeling thirsty,
Learn the lessons by heart,
Make effort double to look smart,
I may not care and also respect,
Teacher and senior when they inspect,
Still, you never mention to my parents,
Never put remarkAnd also prevent,
Still, I not realize and continue to grow,
If a teacher isnot around whistle I blow,
Still, I find love and enough care,
Not good at study and not aware,
Should I fare badly never do a mail?
Papa and mummy may rush by rail,
They will take me home if I fail,
Put me in the room to serve in jail,
I make you a promise to be a good boy,
Learn and work hard and never make ploy,
My parents may get angry and not offer toy
So teacher please you not make them annoy

He learnt how to
hit his wife
from his Dad
who hit his

And his mother hit him
glad this time not to be the victim.
Whether it be fist in face
knee in belly
or the bitter welt from a belt
violence sleeps quitely
and dreams
of the people it will
come alive in.
All down the years
it mutates from person to person
face to face

to cry
'....no...please! '
And there is no one to hear
you screaming."

Life is no private,
they consumed them for public,

for an err of no cost.
So much fund never fun,
more work never won,
plenty of debt never a death,
many hearts, often hurts.
Good follower but no power,
better will, never wail,
clean thoughts often taught,
best choice is there in naught.
a mover to be moved,
a model to unmold,
a conversationalist  for the least,

Lighting wisdom to mind decayed and white,
Floating tirelessly till dark with no pride,
Without fear and favor telling tales bright.
To clean the dirt river flows and air floats,
To vibrate heart and mind he gloats.
‘Tween goddess Sarswati and man he is linking milk,
Giving life to the world with deepest think.
As blessed banyan with roots, side by side,
Withstand winter, storm, wind and tide,
Beauty he admires and goodness wide,
Word and language such as teacher ride,
He will turn dust to gold, if his ways not hide,
And rake a soul with favorite manifold glide.

Without colours?
“I have no clue
What they look like”
Said Pushkar.
I have been
Blind
Since I was three.
His calm face
And confident pace
Showed his total
Acceptance.
He had an acute sense
And sometimes
While reading
To him
He would interrupt me
And say
‘Today you are not wearing a smile”
He could sense
My restlessness
Once in a while
At times
He too lost his composure
Naked with his emotions
Depressed about his future
And looked for solace
In his teacher.
Now he is a grown man
With a family of his own
And takes pride
That he can see
The world through their eyes.
He doesn’t believe
I learnt so much
Watching him evolve:
Hope, endurance,
Perseverance."

When I am tired, I feel sleepy,

Rather she shows me the way
How to make that part strong....

we may certainly at times fall,
but life teaches us to stand tall,
we have many desires and dreams,
life teaches us to be agleam,
there may be times of sorrow,

Where it can't be learnt by any other means!
It is the anchor to give us the happiness;
That can be dissolved neither in air nor in water!
It is adorned in the sky to show us;
The path of nature and its divine silence!
It is the jewel made up of haze;
To welcome the guest- rainfall!
It is a boon, given to us;
For the long penance of our eyes!

To destroy the disparity among men!

For like 'tis said such a friend is a friend indeed
One who stands by you when you are feeling down
A cash strapped and depressed poor soul of the town
'Tis when you are most in need your friend you come to know
You ask one you thought was a good mate for a small loan his answer to you no
One who is not short of money of which you are aware
Yet a ten dollar note for you he could not spare
Yet a person you did not know well one you had met a few times before
Gave you the ten dollars and asked did you need more
That this person is your friend you've come to realize
In life every day there is some new surprise
In retrospect in years from now you will recall
That those you thought were your friends not your friends after all

Each time we come to you,  you act as a parent.
Each time we come to you,  you impart your talent.
You shape our personality, teach us the reality and
You build our confidence.
You took this path in your life,
To enlighten the path of ours,
Building up our life.
Teaching us attitudes,
And we pay with gratitude.
Without you we are not who we are,
Without you we are not what we are.
No words can express our thanks,
No gifts can express our gratitude,
Or the love that we have for you.
So, the least we can do is honor this day to every teacher to assure that,
You live in our hearts now and forever! !
Happy Teacher's Day!"

Her smile is pink.
She comes from America,
I come  from China.
She has blue eyes,
I have black.
She eats suger cane on Christmas,
I prefer Jiaozi at Spring Festival.
She is my English teaher,
I am her lovely student.
I heard that she would read the Bible everyday.
I noticed that when December is coming around,
She will be wearing the Christmas clothes all the time,
I felt that she is old enough to tell me the secret of life.
She looks so young and energetic,
She looks so amazing.
On Chistmas Day,
She wearing the earrings of gold christmas tree,
Told me,
'You can enjoy the big merriment of this day! '
God will give you anything you like,
If you believe in him.
Learn to be a choice for God."
152,Emotion,TeacherPoemsDutiesOfATeacherPoembyJosephTRenaldi,"The everyday duties of a teacher
Are as difficult as they can be,
Whether in an elementary or secondary school
Or whether the teacher is a he or she.
The teacher must possess a bundle of information,
A knowledge that will constantly shine,
And in addition must maintain class discipline
To keep all the students properly in line.
There are insurmountable number of questions
To be answered during every period of the day,
And test papers must be carefully graded when
The students leave and go merrily on their way.
The pleasures and encounters of an evening out
Are few and seldom to be socially shared,
Because the next day's lessons must have priority,
Be reviewed and lessons carefully prepared.
A  dedicated teacher gets a personal satisfaction
In this cumbersome and timeless atmosphere.
The role of a teacher is vital in this complex world,
Preparing all students for a future career."

The day od clouds and thick darkness will meet us all;
But, copulation brings about the fertilization of the eggs.
To quicken your pace in this 'rat-race'!
With nods and grunts;
And like the legends of the Hidden City! !
But, you need to dicover your inner self as well on this love.
This thing called 'love' is eating you up!
And, you now need my romance to keep you going;
For, i am an eloquent teacher who wants to lead you on."

155,Emotion,TeacherPoemsTeacher3ATributeToZenobiaMistriTeacherParExcellencePoembyDrGeetaRadhakrishnaMenon,"Just when I am attempting
To write on Vedas and Upanishads;
Comprehending the status of a Guru,
The powerful role of an exemplary teacher,
And just wondering
Whether such reverence
Still existed in this modern age?
Referred to by the Upanishads,
And other ancient texts of India:
I get an answer through this book
""Zenobia Mistri
Teacher Par Excellence.""
Here is a rare tribute by an earnest student,
Shireen Isal,
To her beloved French teacher -
Zenobia Mistri,
who lived a long, rich life
Contributing generously to education,
By teaching a beautiful language,
Propagating the culture of a romantic land,
Most diligently and passionately,
For over five decades,
To numerous of students in Bombay and Poona,
Today, its value spread in different parts of the world.
The book covers the life story of Zenobia
With the fragrance of love and respect
By the ever faithful and grateful student,
Right from her birth in Karachi,
Born to Jamshedji and Goolbanoo,
A well educated Parsi family,
Who migrated to Bombay with their six daughters.
Zenobia, their third daughter became one of the most
Renowned teachers of her time creating a powerful legacy,
A celebration of beauty in language, literature and poetry.
She was a committed teacher who reached out
To her students with the warmth of a generous soul.
Zenobia majored in French from the famed St Xavier's college
And later, did her D.LITT. in Paris.
After her return to India, and while working as a teacher in Poona
She met Pirosha Mistry.
At the age of forty four, Zenobia married Pirosha Mistry
Who was sixty five, almost twenty years her senior.
It was a happy marriage which Zenobia
Termed as ‘sixteen golden years of her life'.
Besides teaching, Zenobia devoted her time
And energy to charitable work
For the poor, sick and under privileged.
She keenly pursued woman's education and their progress.
Later in life, she became fascinated
With the teachings of Sri Aurobindo.
Zenobia became a regular visitor
To Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry
And became a great devotee of the Mother.
The rest of her life was spent
On a spiritual quest,
A journey to conquer the inner world
Of truth and objective of life,
A journey that rewarded her
With inner peace and tranquillity,
Before her final journey to the heavens above.
Shireen Isal, my friend
Speaks, reads and writes excellent French
I have heard her speak this musical language
And was always reminded of the princess
In Grimm's Fairy tales,
How when she spoke, pearls fell out of her mouth.
The sweet language of French is made sweeter
When she speaks with such eloquence and grace.
I wondered!
If the student is so good
Then, how wonderful must have been the teacher
Who taught her this exquisite, sweet, French language!"
156,Emotion,TeacherPoemsTeacherPoembyWojjaFink,"I ask a question
And am showered in grace
My tongue wags
And there is no answer
I am silent
And there are no questions
Only the inner love
That knows all the answers.
Before the questions were born.
I approach him with an empty heart
And he fills it with good tidings
I offer him blind words
And he gives them eyes
I offer him my dumb tongue
And he speaks eloquence in essence
He takes my tears as full stops
And breathes new life in old meanings,
I cannot find the words
But thankfulness;
Speaks without end."
157,Emotion,TeacherPoemsOhTeacherOhTeacherPoembySharmilaSaheed,"Oh teacher, Oh teacher!
My test isn't signed
Because somehow
My parents went blind
Now, don't say it's my fault,
They left their hands in the bank vault.
Oh teacher, Oh teacher
Do you know why
I was born without wings
And so cannot fly
Thus I am late
Didn't have breakfast,
So if you don't mind,
Pass me a plate.
Oh teacher, Oh teacher!
I've failed again
Please don't scold me,
Now  you'll see why,
I was thinking about
Having an eagle's brain."

161,Emotion,TeacherPoemsSonnetNaturesTheBestTeacherPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"Mother Nature’s the best teacher we know,
Teaching both young and old without a fee;
Through flora, fauna and all creatures, oh!
Her lessons being unique, naturally.
Vowels, consonants, she shows to utter;
Her music is most melodious to ears;
And anyone in her lap learns better,
Than what classrooms can teach them o’er the years.
A loving Mother Nature is to all!
She soothes their minds and mends their broken hearts;
A friend and guide and playmate, one can call,
Who shares her hidden secrets in small parts.
So, go to Mother Nature, learn a lot;
No teacher betters her in any slot."
162,Emotion,TeacherPoemsTheGeographyTeacherPoembyRajendranMuthiah,"Never he showed the maps and globes to the boys.
His sudden entry scared them in the room.
Straddling his bike, he flew with a deafening noise.
To stop the smiles of the urchins, he'd loom.
He'd be going ratty if the boys said jokes.
To shun criticism, enough were his looks.
He'd stop teaching if a sore throat made croaks.
His wild punishment alarmed the young crooks.
Loud teaching he spurned as he was wont to read books."

Of twenty years gone days
Panorama displayed before me.

Nor my mind could utter' Yes'
My teacher I found in one Daily
Under bold word 'Obituary'
Impounded within a square box.
I found my teacher seeing me
Teaching me.....
Advising me......
Narrating me the fallen fate
And being pasted.
Unnerved I was;
The Envelope carrying parcel gift
Bearing his address from within my bag
Pinched me...
For I was in the counter
Posting thro' courier
A souvenir for his deeds
For coining me of the day
Wishing Him 'Long-Live'
For the next Day was
The Day to remember- salute his stature;
The teacher's day...
The 5th.September."

And with a heart that deeply cares,
You add a lot of love
To everything you share,
And even though
You mean a lot,
You’ll never know how much,
For you helped
To change the world
Through every life you touched.
You sparked the creativity
In the students whom you taught,
And helped them strive for goals
That could not be bought,
You are such a special teacher
That no words can truly tell
However much you’re valued
For the work you do so well."
168,Emotion,TeacherPoemsIfIBecomeATeacherPoembySnehaKhedkar,"This is the first poem I have written.
----------------
If I become a teacher I will
Respect the children's every emotion,
I will teach in such a way,
That learning will be fun.
Everyone in the class will be
Encouraged at every bend,
In my class unfair things
Will definitely come to an end.
In my class I will
Conduct interesting experiments.
The children will always remember
Those happily spent moments.
No one in my class,
Will be beaten or scolded,
Every one will be
Taught properly instead.
Every one will be allowed to
Express their feelings with ease.
Every child will be willing to help
Children bad at studies.
Children who dread studies
Will be shown its positive side.
Then from studies
They will not try to hide.
There will be no reason
For anyone to feel left out.
For I will give everyone equal importance
Of this there is no doubt.
The children's aim will be
To achieve excellence, not success.
For this will ultimately lead them
To the path of happiness."
169,Emotion,TeacherPoemsTheTeacherOfWisdomPoembyOscarWilde,"From his childhood he had been as one filled with the perfect
knowledge of God, and even while he was yet but a lad many of the
saints, as well as certain holy women who dwelt in the free city of
his birth, had been stirred to much wonder by the grave wisdom of
his answers.
And when his parents had given him the robe and the ring of manhood
he kissed them, and left them and went out into the world, that he
might speak to the world about God. For there were at that time
many in the world who either knew not God at all, or had but an
incomplete knowledge of Him, or worshipped the false gods who dwell
in groves and have no care of their worshippers.
And he set his face to the sun and journeyed, walking without
sandals, as he had seen the saints walk, and carrying at his girdle
a leathern wallet and a little water-bottle of burnt clay.
And as he walked along the highway he was full of the joy that
comes from the perfect knowledge of God, and he sang praises unto
God without ceasing; and after a time he reached a strange land in
which there were many cities.
And he passed through eleven cities. And some of these cities were
in valleys, and others were by the banks of great rivers, and
others were set on hills. And in each city he found a disciple who
loved him and followed him, and a great multitude also of people
followed him from each city, and the knowledge of God spread in the
whole land, and many of the rulers were converted, and the priests
of the temples in which there were idols found that half of their
gain was gone, and when they beat upon their drums at noon none, or
but a few, came with peacocks and with offerings of flesh as had
been the custom of the land before his coming.
Yet the more the people followed him, and the greater the number of
his disciples, the greater became his sorrow. And he knew not why
his sorrow was so great. For he spake ever about God, and out of
the fulness of that perfect knowledge of God which God had Himself
given to him.
And one evening he passed out of the eleventh city, which was a
city of Armenia, and his disciples and a great crowd of people
followed after him; and he went up on to a mountain and sat down on
a rock that was on the mountain, and his disciples stood round him,
and the multitude knelt in the valley.
And he bowed his head on his hands and wept, and said to his Soul,
'Why is it that I am full of sorrow and fear, and that each of my
disciples is an enemy that walks in the noonday?' And his Soul
answered him and said, 'God filled thee with the perfect knowledge
of Himself, and thou hast given this knowledge away to others. The
pearl of great price thou hast divided, and the vesture without
seam thou hast parted asunder. He who giveth away wisdom robbeth
himself. He is as one who giveth his treasure to a robber. Is not
God wiser than thou art? Who art thou to give away the secret that
God hath told thee? I was rich once, and thou hast made me poor.
Once I saw God, and now thou hast hidden Him from me.'
And he wept again, for he knew that his Soul spake truth to him,
and that he had given to others the perfect knowledge of God, and
that he was as one clinging to the skirts of God, and that his
faith was leaving him by reason of the number of those who believed
in him.
And he said to himself, 'I will talk no more about God. He who
giveth away wisdom robbeth himself.'
And after the space of some hours his disciples came near him and
bowed themselves to the ground and said, 'Master, talk to us about
God, for thou hast the perfect knowledge of God, and no man save
thee hath this knowledge.'
And he answered them and said, 'I will talk to you about all other
things that are in heaven and on earth, but about God I will not
talk to you. Neither now, nor at any time, will I talk to you
about God.'
And they were wroth with him and said to him, 'Thou hast led us
into the desert that we might hearken to thee. Wilt thou send us
away hungry, and the great multitude that thou hast made to follow
thee?'
And he answered them and said, 'I will not talk to you about God.'
And the multitude murmured against him and said to him, 'Thou hast
led us into the desert, and hast given us no food to eat. Talk to
us about God and it will suffice us.'
But he answered them not a word. For he knew that if he spake to
them about God he would give away his treasure.
And his disciples went away sadly, and the multitude of people
returned to their own homes. And many died on the way.
And when he was alone he rose up and set his face to the moon, and
journeyed for seven moons, speaking to no man nor making any
answer. And when the seventh moon had waned he reached that desert
which is the desert of the Great River. And having found a cavern
in which a Centaur had once dwelt, he took it for his place of
dwelling, and made himself a mat of reeds on which to lie, and
became a hermit. And every hour the Hermit praised God that He had
suffered him to keep some knowledge of Him and of His wonderful
greatness.
Now, one evening, as the Hermit was seated before the cavern in
which he had made his place of dwelling, he beheld a young man of
evil and beautiful face who passed by in mean apparel and with
empty hands. Every evening with empty hands the young man passed
by, and every morning he returned with his hands full of purple and
pearls. For he was a Robber and robbed the caravans of the
merchants.
And the Hermit looked at him and pitied him. But he spake not a
word. For he knew that he who speaks a word loses his faith.
And one morning, as the young man returned with his hands full of
purple and pearls, he stopped and frowned and stamped his foot upon
the sand, and said to the Hermit: 'Why do you look at me ever in
this manner as I pass by? What is it that I see in your eyes? For
no man has looked at me before in this manner. And the thing is a
thorn and a trouble to me.'
And the Hermit answered him and said, 'What you see in my eyes is
pity. Pity is what looks out at you from my eyes.'
And the young man laughed with scorn, and cried to the Hermit in a
bitter voice, and said to him, 'I have purple and pearls in my
hands, and you have but a mat of reeds on which to lie. What pity
should you have for me? And for what reason have you this pity?'
'I have pity for you,' said the Hermit, 'because you have no
knowledge of God.'
'Is this knowledge of God a precious thing?' asked the young man,
and he came close to the mouth of the cavern.
'It is more precious than all the purple and the pearls of the
world,' answered the Hermit.
'And have you got it?' said the young Robber, and he came closer
still.
'Once, indeed,' answered the Hermit, 'I possessed the perfect
knowledge of God. But in my foolishness I parted with it, and
divided it amongst others. Yet even now is such knowledge as
remains to me more precious than purple or pearls.'
And when the young Robber heard this he threw away the purple and
the pearls that he was bearing in his hands, and drawing a sharp
sword of curved steel he said to the Hermit, 'Give me, forthwith
this knowledge of God that you possess, or I will surely slay you.
Wherefore should I not slay him who has a treasure greater than my
treasure?'
And the Hermit spread out his arms and said, 'Were it not better
for me to go unto the uttermost courts of God and praise Him, than
to live in the world and have no knowledge of Him? Slay me if that
be your desire. But I will not give away my knowledge of God.'
And the young Robber knelt down and besought him, but the Hermit
would not talk to him about God, nor give him his Treasure, and the
young Robber rose up and said to the Hermit, 'Be it as you will.
As for myself, I will go to the City of the Seven Sins, that is but
three days' journey from this place, and for my purple they will
give me pleasure, and for my pearls they will sell me joy.' And he
took up the purple and the pearls and went swiftly away.
And the Hermit cried out and followed him and besought him. For
the space of three days he followed the young Robber on the road
and entreated him to return, nor to enter into the City of the
Seven Sins.
And ever and anon the young Robber looked back at the Hermit and
called to him, and said, 'Will you give me this knowledge of God
which is more precious than purple and pearls? If you will give me
that, I will not enter the city.'
And ever did the Hermit answer, 'All things that I have I will give
thee, save that one thing only. For that thing it is not lawful
for me to give away.'
And in the twilight of the third day they came nigh to the great
scarlet gates of the City of the Seven Sins. And from the city
there came the sound of much laughter.
And the young Robber laughed in answer, and sought to knock at the
gate. And as he did so the Hermit ran forward and caught him by
the skirts of his raiment, and said to him: 'Stretch forth your
hands, and set your arms around my neck, and put your ear close to
my lips, and I will give you what remains to me of the knowledge of
God.' And the young Robber stopped.
And when the Hermit had given away his knowledge of God, he fell
upon the ground and wept, and a great darkness hid from him the
city and the young Robber, so that he saw them no more.
And as he lay there weeping he was ware of One who was standing
beside him; and He who was standing beside him had feet of brass
and hair like fine wool. And He raised the Hermit up, and said to
him: 'Before this time thou hadst the perfect knowledge of God.
Now thou shalt have the perfect love of God. Wherefore art thou
weeping?' And he kissed him."

175,Emotion,TeacherPoemsAbideByTeacherPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"I was abused literally and pushed aside by teacher
He was in rage to see me when I tried to enter
He might have some grievances in mind to nurture
As I was doing fare in studies and position was assured
I was really ashy boy but excellent in pick up
I heard attentively and was cheered with thumb up
His behavior as teacher made great impact in mind
I might have taken it lightly if he was harsh or unkind
It is customary to show little disrespect to the poor students
Some of the discourtesy is extended with inferior comments
I was unable to think further but bore a grudge permanently
I remember those abusive remarks and   resisted him once vehemently
I thought and rethought about such behavior
As teacher he would have been considerate and held honor
I became reserved from that day and decided to keep silent
As it was now known to me that best way is to offer no comment
In social circle too certain disliking exist for people
It may be more intensive when they are incapable
Not in financial capacity to move forward and compete
Live under their dominance and agree to submit
I remained firm in approach but turned away from close contacts
I kept good will at heart and prayed for their well being in fact
This gave me enough of strength to observe them from distance
I was taken little note of and none observed my presence
I return gesture with kind words and remain aloof
I have enough of strength financially as single proof
They dare not to see me with inferiority and pull down
As I have established of my own and became powerfully known
I wish that same kind of maltreatment is not shown
To children who are unfortunate of having means of their own
They are really asset to us and builder of future generation
How can we be indifferent when question of building nation comes?
I have known some of the people getting blinded
By sudden arrival of fortune and secretly confided
Their common sense gets unnatural boost to reveal
The arrogance is reflected and shown with no efforts to conceal"

Take such a Stand, and you will find peace

178,Emotion,TeacherPoemsSonnetTheTeacherPoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"The Teacher isn’t a source of mere knowledge;
Neither is he a passive transmitter;
He frees the creative bird from the hedge,
And makes his students face their lives fitter.
The Teacher helps the student’s mind to grow,
In optimal a way, that’s possible;
The students needn’t the Teacher’s line just tow;
Curiosity that’s born is sensible.
His teaching methods must well suit young minds;
The doubts of students must be respected;
By introspection, every student finds
His strengths and weaknesses/ what’s expected?
Well, Teachers remove society’s evils,
Harnessing creativity of pupils."
179,Emotion,TeacherPoemsFarewellDearTeacherPoembysaniaharris,"For some, you may be the candle
But for me, you are the light
That showed me how to handle
Even the daunting without fright
For some, your eyes may be warm
But for me, they are bright
They showed me the right platform
Leading me to a greater height
For some, you may be spring
But for me, you are the flowers
That groomed me little wings
To fly higher than the towers
For some, you may be a teacher
But for me, you are an angel
And angel whom I’ll never forget
But for now, it is ‘farewell’

180,Emotion,TeacherPoemsLifeIsATeacherPoembyRajaBasu,"Life is a teacher, which teaches how to live.
Life is a teacher, which teaches how to win.
Life is a teacher, which teaches how to laugh.
Life is a teacher, which teaches how to make other people cry.
Life is a teacher, which teaches how to love.
Life is a teacher, which teaches how to hate.
Life is a teacher, which teaches how to win honour.
Life is a teacher, which teaches how to embarrass others.
Indeed, life is a great teacher as it teaches everything.
And in this very greatness lies life's weakness, that it teaches everything.
It teaches how to love, but also teaches how to hate.
It teaches how to help, but also teaches how to harm.
It teaches how to honour (others) , but also teaches how to embarrass (others) .
It teaches how to laugh, but also teaches how to make other people cry.
Wish life were a bit selective in its teaching.
But can't we be a bit selective in taking lessons?"

His name was Mister Unsworth and he taught us history.
And when you didn't know a date he'd get you by the ear
And start to twist while you sat there quite paralysed with fear.
He'd twist and twist and twist your ear and twist it more and more.
Until at last the ear came off and landed on the floor.
Our class was full of one-eared boys. I'm certain there were eight.
Who'd had them twisted off because they didn't know a date.
So let us now praise teachers who today are all so fine
And yours in particular is totally divine.'"

you can tell what is best,
and you loves us to have funny fest,
could that be any better?
without my second parent?

184,Emotion,TeacherPoemsTheTeacherPoembyLeonGellert,"A Cross is slanting ‘tween two withered trees -
I saw him first in peace, amid a crowd
Of streets, nor dreamed him ever one of these,
So wistfully he mused, so shyly proud,
So chalk-besmeared he walked his weary pace.
A space went, - and on an early day
Within the trench, I saw a half-known face
Awake with wonder; a child-lived heart at play
With dreamed romance: a Drake-keen eye ashine
For newer worlds……A thunder tore the line!…..
A shell burst!….. He smiled as Sidney smiled-
And fell…..There came the crying of a child,
…..A wave of little hands…..a soft breeze
The cross is slanting ‘tween two withered trees."
185,Emotion,TeacherPoemsATeacherIsGrievedPoembyrajagopalharan,"The final exams are in the offing
Mugging and bugging in full swing
Burning the midnight oil
Stumble to go to the next class
…………
Youthful faces with awe in the look
Start the year with cheering sigh
I know each by name calling day and day out
Half yearly closes breaking half my heart
Reaching the wards as everlasting partners
Achieved by bricking inch by inch
Portions are over and prelims are done with
Gems are ready though not for sale
Comes the day call it farewell
Loading tonnes of grief into my heart
Students nay my children start
Praising me for anything and everything
Tears start rolling down my cheeks
Not that praise inebriates me
Fear of separation and pangs of love
Prick  the heart with pin’s precision
Comes the vacation and birds fly off
Corrections to care, I go on with papers
Letters show me the person behind
Making me smile and cry
With pain in the heart and
Gain of centum result
I allow my children
To jump to the next class
Time rolls by with mixed feeling
Reach the school to the same class
New faces new hopes new feelings
Another set of children to make me happy and sad!"
186,Emotion,TeacherPoemsTheTeacherOfAllIKnowPoembyRaniTurton,"Here alone with all I profess
A faith, a belief in some systems of thought
Professors and priests, mystics and bards
All were often one I confess.
There were some unlettered men
Who knew more than the savants, then
There were bards who could sing and swear
And find their way to your heart there.
There were wild poppies dancing
Wild horses prancing
The teacher of all I know
Came for a few  seasons
Then went for his own benighted reasons.
There was  life’s blood and show
The poetry and pain and pageantry's stream
Whirled around in a fevered dream
Life was what it did not seem
Thus taught the  teacher of all I know."

188,Emotion,TeacherPoemsTheHistoryTeacherPoembyKelseaOsterman,"The last of the group is a teacher.
A history teacher to be in fact.
And I know many hate the study of history,
But there are some who just love his classes.
He is young and loves to shout.
Calling you by nicknames if you have one.
He is a kind man to some.
And hard on the others.
His classes are required so you must see him
At least twice in your high school career.
He cares for his students and loves to have fun in his classes.
He is one of those teachers, who you don't make mad,
Of fear of being yelled at.
He tells his students he loves them at the end of his classes.
He says third hour is the best.
But we all know better to believe that.
He calls us all sausages.
He is kind and is willing to work with students.
His essays are fun and hard all at the same time.
He shouts at us to make them two hundred words,
And no less than two hundred.
He is a strange man,
Dresses as he wants and never really a care in the world.
He loves his job and the kids who seem to care.
This man is in search of the Milky Way.
Not the one we may see in the sky at night.
No the one that tastes like heaven.
With it's rich chocolate and its caramel delight."

with not a friggin' hair

But on that faithful morning
when certain feelings landed

it happened, and it did so quickly.
No rescue or reprieve, no hiding grace,
it's what they label 'in the act', that counts

How could one, ever, forget the shame,

I sometimes think that my mistakes,

191,Emotion,TeacherPoemsTheTeacherPoembyRICBASTASA,"The teacher must know
As Plato once
Well said it
Years ago,
A teacher is but a midwife
But the disciple
The student
Is still the one who
Gets himself
Impregnated with
Ideas
The teacher simply helps
In giving the birth
Of the ideas that
The student must himself
Conceive
When the ideas are born
The teacher cares for them
Newly born babies
Now having exciting lives
Of their own
The teacher watches them
Very well pleased,
Excited for something new
Greater than himself,
Rising above
Almost all else, then the teacher
Claps his hands & then
Happily dies,
His mission is accomplished."
192,Emotion,TeacherPoemsThisPeachMyTeacherPoembyMichaelShepherd,"This peach
that I’ve just eaten,
been graced by,
been blessed by,
been taught by,
been transformed by…
it’s as if some
Messenger of the Gods
had arrived, stopwatch in hand,
saying, everything holds in perfection
but a little moment -
as William Shakespeare noted:
so I’m going to arrange things so that
as the stopwatch ticks out
ten seconds to that moment,
you’ll reach out your hand to the fruitbowl,
take it, feel its yielding softness under velvet skin,
cut it carefully twice through the poles,
once equatorially… and as it falls apart,
spear one segment; eat…
this peach
was full of what even Rilke
could say no more than, peachness..
it was a living proof of Plato:
its perfection taught me
where essence meets experience,
where actuality meets the ideal of peach;
where a singular perfection speaks of
all perfections; where perfection
leaves from perfection, naught else but perfect…
how could such a perfect thing
have been invented by one
who does not love? Who is not love?
This peach is love itself, and I the worshipper
must needs make of myself a living God
to whom to kneel, to offer praise and gratitude
for all perfection known..
this peach my teacher."
193,Emotion,TeacherPoemsMyTeacherMyMentorPoembyShambaKaunda,"As the sun shines so we make our hay,
Knowing that it is not here to stay,
And that soon it will fade away,
For as the dawn comes so will the day,
For patience and hope we pray,
That the light we follow will never stray,
Our trust and future i their hands we lay,
Waiting for their teachings and inspiration as a pay,
Like clay, in the hands of a potter,
Is like our lives in their hands they say,
And if we try to fool them at to play,
They will mould us into whatever they may,
And the path they will lead us might slay,
So we do as they say,
And follow the whole way."

he is jogging faster than me.
But why he is turning back and looking at me?
I love his half eyes on me.
Is like me he is also recollecting the past
when running faster than him
I had been ahead of him,
and I used to turn back my half eyes
looking at the child behind.
I am now waiting when the child learns
to be loving and kind
to the weaker.
I am sure soon he will be jogging like waves
besides decelerating his speed
and the grandfather will overtake his grandchild.
The teacher is confident this jogging will end in a caress.
He is my student bless him my God, bless!
Bless us with a golden moment
when the student becomes a teacher of his teacher!"
195,Emotion,TeacherPoemsmyYoungTeacherPoembyMamtaAgarwal,"Anika awakens the child in me,
I watch her, as she fetches her toys
And shows off with pride and glee
With her, I don’t have to act poised.
I know, she is actually aware,
Whether am really having fun
Or just pretending to be there.
She never walks, always runs.
Chasing the butterflies and bees
With her frock flying in the air,
I run after her to ensure and see
She may not fall but she couldn’t care.
She dances with sheer abandon,
She hasn’t yet discovered fear.
Her infectious joy fills me with sudden
Energy, I boldly invite her and declare,
Come on let’s play hide and seek.
I call out and just pretend to look all over
I can see her, from behind the bush stealthily peak
Finally catch her, as she bursts in peels of laughter.
Why the child in me had slept for so long?
I guess we are too busy chasing our dreams
And forget to enjoy small pleasures as we go along,
Each mile stone drives us to go full steam,
We go on increasing our pace,
And slowly become sombre and tense.
A smile is replaced by a grimace,
And become adept at keeping the pretence.
She has taught me how to enjoy and be free,
Drool at the sight of a strawberry ice cream
And clap and shout licking it full of glee,
As if eating it was like fulfilling a long lost dream.
I have no clue how long I was lost in reverie,
I was suddenly embraced in a warm hug
She had noiselessly come behind me.
Who needs an anti anxiety drug,
Once you discover the child in you lying latent
And connect with innate sense of joy and pleasure
It is a gift given to the grand parents
By a grandchild, for ever to treasure."
196,Emotion,TeacherPoemsTheTeacherPoembyHilarieJones,"I was twenty-six the first time I held
a human heart in my hand.
It was sixty-four and heavier than I expected,
its chambers slack;
and I was stupidly surprised
at how cold it was.
It was the middle of the third week
before I could look at her face,
before I could spend more than an hour
learning the secrets of cirrhosis,
the dark truth of diabetes, the black lungs
of the Marlboro woman, the exquisite
painful shape of kidney stones,
without eating an entire box of Altoids
to smother the smell of formaldehyde.
After seeing her face, I could not help
but wonder if she had a favorite color;
if she hated beets,
or loved country music before her hearing
faded, or learned to read
before cataracts placed her in perpetual twilight.
I wondered if her mother had once been happy
when she'd come home from school
or if she'd ever had a valentine from a secret admirer.
In the weeks that followed, I would
drive the highways, scanning billboards.
I would see her face, her eyes
squinting away the cigarette smoke,
or she would turn up at the bus stop
pushing a grocery cart of empty
beer cans and soda bottles. I wondered
if that was how she'd paid for all those smokes
or if the scars of repeated infections in her womb
spoke to a more universal currency.
Did she die, I wondered, in a cardboard box
under the Burnside Bridge, nursing a bottle
of strawberry wine, telling herself
she felt a little warmer now,
or in the Good Faith Shelter,
her few belongings safe under the sheet
held to her faltering heart?
Or in the emergency room, lying
on a wheeled gurney, the pitiless
lights above, the gauzy curtains around?
Did she ever wonder what it all was for?
I wish I could have told her in those days
what I've now come to know: that
it was for this--the baring
of her body on the stainless steel table--
that I might come to know its secrets
and, knowing them, might listen
to the machine-shop hum of aortic stenosis
in an old woman's chest, smile a little to myself
and, in gratitude to her who taught me,
put away my stethoscope, turn to my patient
and say Let's talk about your heart."
197,Emotion,TeacherPoems044TeacherWhoTaughtMeTheAlphabetsOfLovePoembypremjipremji,"I still remember him, though his face is not clear
For he only brought me to the world of
Alphabets, numbers and wonderful stories
Parents were renowned teachers, but failed to
Teach me, at least to count from one to ten
Father predicted, my IQ is sub-zero
Teaching me is mere wastage of time
My grandma took me to his house, with a patio
In front, thatched with coconut leaves,
For she could not stand my pathetic infancy
He welcomed us with immense grace
And patiently planted those seedlings of life into
My deserted mind, bruised with lots of pinches and slaps
He taught me the alphabets of my mother-tongue
He taught me to count from one to thousand
Father, with bachelor’s degree in education,
Failed to teach me count from one to ten
But my teacher succeeded in his venture with
Colourful results, even-though he was just matriculate
He used teach me an hour everyday
And grandma waited beside with great merriment
Sometimes his lungs chocked with the attack of Asthma
His sound was feeble, still he didn’t leave me
One day, we were on the way to his house
Through the green paddy fields,
Someone came opposite told,
Please don’t take him there, for his teacher is no more…
One, with lot of love, immense patience
And adequate knowledge can easily open
The inner eye of any child
But, God, why don’t you teach
This simple fact to those millions of parents?

When I am done with school,

To teach and inspire others,
Just like my teachers have inspired me.
I will love each and every student:

Give them praise for the good they’ve done,
Congratulate them for awards they’ve won,
And have faith in each and every one.
I’ll be the teacher everyone loves:
Who smiles to everyone

The kiss,

A moments’ pressure,
Painted lips,
A moments’ pleasure."

Chill was in the evening air
Desert land bare and brown

Dressed all in black
She tapped softly at my door
She still possessed a knack
To shake me to my core
Dinner for two at some quiet place
Where time once more stood still
Rekindled love set hearts to race
Life held no greater thrill
We shook hands, said good bye
I chanced “A Stolen Kiss”
Then gone the magic moment
of our romantic bliss...

202,Emotion,KissPoemsFirstKissPoembyJohnRoche,"He dances with his shadow like a youthful Fred Astaire,
such symbiotic harmony, they make a perfect pair.
No footfalls can be heard around about them as they move,
through empty evening streets, they waltz to beats of true love's groove.
They float upon a vapour trail which carries them aloft
on mem'ries of the sweetest touch of tender lips, so soft.
He laughs at shadow's antics as his mind's consumed with bliss
and the treasure she bestowed him with that magical first kiss.
A moment that he carries even to this very day,
Though many years have pass'd them by, they both still feel that way.
The passion that ignited in the fuel of youthful lust,
became so much more to them, through their love, respect and trust."

In the summertime,

In a dreamless home.

To an exotic place
Where I’ll have a new
And lovelier face.
A girl will kiss me
Who doesn’t intend
To make me cry."
204,Emotion,KissPoemsAKissIsMoreThanAKissPoembyLeslieAlexis,"If I were to stand in a pool of your tears
And found that my acts placed them there
Then love, my love… I would sink to hell.
Where there is life I would not dwell.
My heaven, sweet heaven, is in your smile,
And heaven’s beauty I wish not defile;
So, if my lips were to kiss one not your own,
I pray my head would fall off its bone
That it does not reach my heart of stone,
Which will rot as this virus spreads.
Instead of betraying your love, I rather be dead.
And if my hands were to hold her waist as done to yours,
My limps, every finger, I pray would be strewn
Upon the ground, for it is better if I were a thought,
Than to betray the one who gave me her heart.
Your heart I value much more than rain
On a desert journey of many years.
Thirst be thirst… to mine for you, nothing compares.
I long for you as a desert does for dew.
Knowing that which I receive is not from me,
I value your love; each day it gives jubilee.
Your kiss is more than a kiss, it is a sign,
And it says for eternity you will be mine.
And as your shadow does, I belong to you,
I love you."

I've been wronged all year, tedious
nights, nothing but rough elbows in them
and delicate boxes of Kleenex calling crybaby
crybaby, you fool!
Before today my body was useless.
Now it's tearing at its square corners.
It's tearing old Mary's garments off, knot by knot
and see - Now it's shot full of these electric bolts.
Zing! A resurrection!
Once it was a boat, quite wooden
and with no business, no salt water under it
and in need of some paint. It was no more
than a group of boards. But you hoisted her, rigged her.
She's been elected.
My nerves are turned on. I hear them like
musical instruments. Where there was silence
the drums, the strings are incurably playing. You did this.
Pure genius at work. Darling, the composer has stepped

kiss me sweetly in the corner of martyrdom
kiss me with longing at the border of glory
tomorrow I leave without knowing where!
Kiss me without rest with your best kiss

207,Emotion,KissPoemsRepeatedlyKissThePillowPoembyUriahHamilton,"Brunette lady
With dark mysterious eyes,
You even mesmerize the moonlight
Falling softly upon you with love.
In a midnight garden, roses sleep
Like happy angels,
But you walk with a man
Kissing the nape of your neck,
Running his hand beneath your blouse
To touch your stomach in ecstasy.
The heavens are breathing romance,
Amorous gods and goddesses are disrobing,
The world is becoming intoxicated
With the wine of desire,
And you alone surpass them all
With your supple body of captivating dreams,
With the slightest movements of your breasts
Making every gazing man tremulous,
Setting off lovely eruptions.
It is impossible to possess you,
But I would repeatedly kiss the pillow
That has cradled and caressed your head
While you peacefully slept
And left the world anxiously waiting
To see your magnificent vision again."
208,Emotion,KissPoemsTheKissADialoguePoembyRobertHerrick,"1  Among thy fancies, tell me this,
What is the thing we call a kiss?
2  I shall resolve ye what it is:--
It is a creature born and bred
Between the lips, all cherry-red,
By love and warm desires fed,--
CHOR.  And makes more soft the bridal bed.
2  It is an active flame, that flies
First to the babies of the eyes,
And charms them there with lullabies,--
CHOR.  And stills the bride, too, when she cries.
2  Then to the chin, the cheek, the ear,
It frisks and flies, now here, now there:
'Tis now far off, and then 'tis near,--
CHOR.  And here, and there, and every where.
1  Has it a speaking virtue?  2  Yes.
1  How speaks it, say?  2  Do you but this,--
Part your join'd lips, then speaks your kiss;
CHOR.  And this Love's sweetest language is.
1  Has it a body?  2  Ay, and wings,
With thousand rare encolourings;
And as it flies, it gently sings--
CHOR.  Love honey yields, but never stings."

210,Emotion,KissPoemsTheKissPoembySaraTeasdale,"I hoped that he would love me,
And he has kissed my mouth,
But I am like a stricken bird
That cannot reach the south.
For though I know he loves me,
To-night my heart is sad;
His kiss was not so wonderful
As all the dreams I had."

212,Emotion,KissPoemsToKissOrNotToKissPoembymaggiesignaigo,"Excuse me…
While I kiss this guy
What would he do
If I gave it a try?
Would he kiss me back?
Or would he even pucker?
Would he latch onto me
Like an all day sucker?
Sometimes you wanna
But you just don’t dare
And sometimes you do
‘cause you just don’t care
I kinda relate it to
that box of chocolate
You just never quite know
What you ‘re gonna get
Do guys wanna do the kissing?
Or do they want to be kissed?
And if we skipped it altogether
Would it even be missed?
Now that I think about it
Kissing is maybe overrated
But you gotta start somewhere
Or the night is ill-fated
Then you close your eyes
And feel him close to your face
Then surprise…he’s already
Moved to second base
So guys share your target
My neck…above or beneath?
Should I shave my legs?
Or brush my teeth?"
213,Emotion,KissPoemsNextTimeIKissAWomanPoembyUriahHamilton,"In this barroom,
They serve shots of despair
For alienated patrons to drink
And add further misery
To their laundry list of cares.
In August,
A man can be a hero
To his wife and child.
In September,
Sweeping their footsteps
From off the verandah.
In this life,
Tenderness is rare
Like an exotic African bird
Preserved in photography
In a coffee table book.
Next time I kiss a woman,
I’ll taste her breath
Slowly and sweetly,
Linger in her eyes
For eternity
Before I make my exit
And retreat into the shadows
Of another prolonged exile."

That kiss, that I do miss.
That love, that love.
Prettier than a dove.
That heart, that heart.
That heart, that shone like art.
Her hair, her hair.
It floated on the air.
That lie, that lie.
That lie, that made her cry.
The fool, the fool.
I was, to think it cool.
The knife, the knife.
That ended my life."
217,Emotion,KissPoemsThatOneKissPoembyErnestineNorthover,"With wide open eyes, she looked at me,
And climbing up, upon my knee,
Gave me a kiss, which touched my heart
And launched a pain, as if a dart
Had entered my old ageing soul,
And found therein it's final goal!
She smiled and all the joy was mine,
A million stars shone by design,
And twinkled, my whole body, through,
Filling my being with life anew.
With that one kiss, we were as one
Together. Our lives had just begun.

There's a kiss to say I care.
There's a kiss to prove our friendship,
There's a kiss for us to share.
There's a kiss to say it's true

Is the kiss I get from you."
219,Emotion,KissPoemskissKissPoembyDwiutami,"The kiss was two hearts in the warmth.
The kiss was two hearts enjoyed each other.
The kiss was fate in the love.
The kiss was love fire.
The kiss completed the life.
You kissed because of the love.
I kissed because of the longing.
The kiss was two speaking hearts mutually.
Kiss....please I'want to kissed.
The kiss planed the love in the love.
The kiss described all the colours of the rainbow in the heart.
The kiss maintained loyalty.
The kiss escaped from the sadness.
The kiss was the friend in solitude.
The kiss was to introduce us in the belief.
The kiss mixed all the feelings.
The kiss decorated the world.
Did you want to feel the kiss to be perfect?
The perfect kiss must with the love.
The perfect kiss must with the sincerity.
The perfect kiss must with the wish.
The perfect kiss must despise the belief on the love.
The perfect kiss must with the prayer.
The perfect kiss God bless you."

223,Emotion,KissPoemsKissMeTodayPoembyUriahHamilton,"Life is confusing
When your heart is sad;
It is difficult to distinguish
Who your true friends are
And who are merely interlopers
Meddling to step in,
Maneuvering for positions of advantage.
I’d like to go back to a simpler time,
Fill my mind with poetry,
Gaze out into the sunlight
From an afternoon window,
Ride a horse and carriage with you
Until the world was true.
But I’ve been exiled in a cruel country,
Cutting my teeth on the sour fruit
Of dissipating dreams and vanished youth,
My unshaven face has a humble grace
But I do not think you will kiss me today."
224,Emotion,KissPoemsFirstKissPoembyTaraTeeling,"While staring at an innocent yellow wall,
I decide I want my first kiss back.
It was mine, and it was wasted
on a boy without a face.
I remember his gentle scheming
and how I’d believed in fairytales.
My precocious giggles, aimless chatter,
and wide-eyed, summer-night smiles
brought him over the fence with a
jump and a smirk, and then,
his lips were flat on mine.
When he was done and my lips
were smacked with a wet cool,
I opened my eyes to see that
the sky was still blackish-blue.
The birds slept soundly and
the air was possessed
with the slither-'ssh' of cars
and the muffled murmur of the
neighbourhood squawk-boxes.
Time had ambled along,
like a gypsy by the roadside,
and I was still standing stable.
My pink-lipped assailant laughed
lightly to my side, thinking he’d
bested me, perhaps even charmed me.
Yet, with that kiss, he’d undone it all,
and I could see him clearly, even with
a moon that hid nervously behind him.
His voodoo had left me, and I was
free from pins and sins.
His lips had been rough, and
his tongue was a cold, clammy,
flopping fish, flapping clumsily
inside my maidenly mouth.
White feathers floated
to the ground around me
while all the flowers
lowered their heads and sighed.
Disenchanted and flattened,
I struggled to understand
the fuss of all this.
The assault of tangled lips
had violated my whims and wishes
leaving me disheartened,
in need of an escape.
So I left him by the fence
holding his chafed presumptions,
and I went inside,
up to my bedroom
with the pinks and the whites
and quietly closed the door.
You can’t wash it off.
Cupidity died, and
there was no consolation.
That boy’s face became a
muddy, foggy blur, and his
name, in my mind, a four-letter word.
These many years later,
I’ve learned to stop time,
and the kiss is now
a language I’ve mastered.
Lights dance and music plays
and nothing feels cold and
heavy. It warms me.
With all the joyful pecks
and soul-kissing since,
I’d like the first one back."
225,Emotion,KissPoemsTheOneKissPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"The one kiss
I ought to have dismissed
Is haunting me like an unsettled ghost
I felt a lingering sweetness in its taste
Enriched with sensuality and ripeness
I just refused to let it go to waste
The temptation to sample
The kiss of the forbidden apple
was there, out in open air
A kiss is not just a kiss
With my heart the kiss unlocked a door
I never knew was there before
Now I long for more and more
Wishing for everything to be like before
Presently my mind wanders without rest
Time has passed,
My mind still wanders without rest
To forget, I try to do my  best
My eyes which were once closed
Are now wide open
Searching, seeking, trying so hard to spot
The one kiss
I ought to have dismissed

226,Emotion,KissPoemsARiddleOnAKissPoembyWilliamStrode,"What thing is that, nor felt nor seene
Till it bee given? a present for a Queene:
A fine conceite to give and take the like:
The giver yet is farther for to seeke;
The taker doth possesse nothing the more,
The giver hee hath nothing lesse in store:
And given once that nature hath it still,
You cannot keepe or leave it if you will:
The workmanshippe is counted very small,
The labour is esteemed naught at all:
But to conclude, this gift is such indeede,
That, if some see't 'twill make theyr hearts to bleede"
227,Emotion,KissPoemsMothersKissPoembyPdishere,"Skinned knees
Aching bellies
An Ankle sprain;
Mother, your one kiss was enough
To drive all the pain away
Time and again.
Depression striken
At crossroads
Groping for answers
Mother, your one kiss was enough
All dilemmas it did unchain
Time and again.
Unfulfilled promises
Soured friendship
Broken heart, ;
Mother can your kiss fix everything?
Can it mend these broken strings
Can it repair my hurt feelings?
Kiss me today mother,
Be my anchor of strength & hope.
Help me get through the onerous times
Help me handle the matters of mind and heart
Help me break away from these teenage trappings
Kiss me today mother, help me make a start.

228,Emotion,KissPoemsTheKissPoembySiegfriedSassoon,"To these I turn, in these I trust;
Brother Lead and Sister Steel.
To his blind power I make appeal;
I guard her beauty clean from rust.
He spins and burns and loves the air,
And splits a skull to win my praise;
But up the nobly marching days
She glitters naked, cold and fair.
Sweet Sister, grant your soldier this;
That in good fury he may feel
The body where he sets his heel
Quail from your downward darting kiss."
229,Emotion,KissPoemsForAKissPoembyRobertRorabeck,"Away from the night
Everyone moves across the street
To be together, far from,
They are attracted to the light
And the music the flesh makes
As it dies
Traveling away from home
A cross to where I have no eyes, intersecting without hope
And I can not see where she is, gone,
The thing that never was between us
And the flowers in the gutter leading
To the sea- before the sun rises,
The thing that never was dissolves and goes away
In tiny fragments before the sun
And her kiss imagined, always felt,
But never,
All the pleasures of the system, petals budding
From the glowing stems,
Like lines on a road,
The conduits of rushing people,
Discarding me
And I am roadkill lying dead beside
Her bed (as they make some kind of attempt at love)
And forgotten on her neck, a broken gem,
Once priceless- now trash-
In the shadows beside where all
The lives move
Dances to the lights and forgets
Neighborhoods drunken and empty, abandoned museums,
And the life flipping over in mausoleums
Pages in a book read but
Not understood, a bed of transgressions
And falsehoods made-up to hide the stains
Like the nights coming on attracting the
Insects calling our humanity, a god of weekends,
And spirits past,
Forgetting to resist the temptation,
Where my wrist lays open and waiting
For a kiss."
230,Emotion,KissPoemsFirstKissPoembyKrystleNewberry,"It was a late november night
I remember it well
We went to the movies
In Russelville
My parents drove and
in the back we cuddled
When we dropped you off
And I walked you to the door
We Kissed
It was a shy awkward kiss
but one that i'll remember
because in it I felt a promise
From God to me
That you and I will always be
together
since then theres been other kisses
some more passionate and loving
some more meaningful and romantic
but nothing can beat that first time
when our two lips met
it was one second of our time
but it'll last for eternity"
231,Emotion,KissPoemsIWantToKissYouAtNightfallPoembyENRIQUEALBERTOHURTADOMINOTTA,"I want to kiss you at nightfall once again.
I want to kiss your lips tonight again
and taste the glory of your breath again.
I want to get drunk with the wine of your mouth
and to get lost in the unpublished ways of your soul.
I want to kiss your cheerful eyes at midnight once again
when the moon of the summer spills its light on the beach
and the soft rumor of the waves that die in the sand
whisper our names... smoothly.
I want to kiss your drowsy eyes under the light of first sunbeam
while the morning breeze wraps us slowly in a hug
in the solitude of our beach.
I want to fall asleep kissing you subtly another time
and wake up to half-day in the paradise of your embrace
and believe that I am still dreaming!"
232,Emotion,KissPoemsJustAKissPoembyMillenniumRose,"It was just a Kiss
A harmless little Kiss
But it was so tender & so sweet

How was I to know when it began
That I would definitely fall in love forever
And we vowed we'd part absolutely positively NEVER
Oh the magic of just a Kiss"
233,Emotion,KissPoemsTheKissReturnedPoembyJeanDeLaFontaine,"AS WILLIAM walking with his wife was seen,
A man of rank admired her lovely mien.
Who gave you such a charming fair? he cried,
May I presume to kiss your beauteous bride?
With all my heart, replied the humble swain,
You're welcome, sir:--I beg you'll not refrain;
She's at your service: take the boon, I pray;
You'll not such offers meet with ev'ry day.
THE gentleman proceeded as desired;
To get a kiss, alone he had aspired;
So fervently howe'er he pressed her lip,
That Petronella blushed at ev'ry sip.
SEVEN days had scarcely run, when to his arms,
The other took a wife with seraph charms;
And William was allowed to have a kiss,
That filled his soul with soft ecstatic bliss.
Cried he, I wish, (and truly I am grieved)
That when the gentleman a kiss received,
From her I love, he'd gone to greater height,
And with my Petronella passed the night."
234,Emotion,KissPoemskissKissPoembyMichaelMoorcroft,"Driving down the highway,
In her brand new Porsche,
Big sunglasses on,
Her silk scarf blowing in the wind.
A bag of money,
In the back seat,
The zip is down,
She leaves a cloud of money.
Her jewelled hands,
Clutch the leather wheel,
Her big white teeth,
Grin through her big red lips.
The brakes malfunction,
And the car flips,
A cloud of dust and dollars,
Her silk blood stained scarf billows in the wind.

Like the endless stretch of highway
Leading to the city
Where you reside.
I drive weary hour
After weary hour,
The road signs blur,
Lost in the rain showers
Of my unhappy eyes.

I’ll hold your hand
In a flowery field.
Currently, I’m climbing
Mountains of despair;
But one day,
We’ll meet at dawn and kiss."

the one that's more than touch

It lingers for a lifetime

the bursting of your senses

Don’t you worry: things will be fine;
Just eat and sleep and play awhile.
You’ve had your birth on lovely earth;
You’ll take your time to grow up tall;
Soon you’ll become a long-necked beast!
Wait till your legs get strength to stand;
Wait till your bones can make you walk;
Wait till your mouth reaches tree-leaves!
And when you’re tall as your mother,
And children look at you in awe,
You will feel truly, very great!
This is your mother’s kiss of love;
This is your mother’s kiss of pride;
For when you match her neck and stride,
You must bend low too, from above!

243,Emotion,KissPoemsSonnetIiFirstKissPoembySandraOsborne,"With an energy of love between our
Hands, fingers laced between the other.
That first touch of fire reveals the power
Starting to burst and starting to smother,
Tingling tightening, to squeeze off your air,
Blood rushes off to southern most parts,
Your scalp is alive with bumps in your hair,
Your face is reddened with a pounding heart,
Then he pulls you close and you feel the strength,
Of encircling arms around your waist,
Gently he presses, and kisses at length.
Then you look into his rugged soft face,
And smiling and giggling, at all this,
You try and savor your very first kiss."

I lean over to steal a kiss
Once again I was summoned
I get so close to your face
you are amazingly beautiful
I feel my heart starting to race
Feeling your warm breathing
Bringing a fever to my whole body
A tenderness I am yearning
Suddenly you awakened
Smiling like I was expected
And the rest is what I have envisioned"

Again in the circle

Looking in
As someone else
Lives our lives
And there—
A kiss
From me to you
Only it’s not you
And it’s not me
Bodies don’t mean
Anything
Because the souls are
Misplaced and mislead
To a faraway land
Where dreams
Mingle and dance
With reality
And it’s not me and you
That live on the inside
We found the
Outside world
Of magick and drugs
Faerie wings and trolls
A place where sex
Isn’t sex
Not teenagers speeding
Up the path
To adulthood
But souls adjacent
And molding"

A farewell, and then forever!
Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee,
Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee.
Who shall say that Fortune grieves him,
While the star of hope she leaves him?
Me, nae cheerfu' twinkle lights me;
Dark despair around benights me.
I'll ne'er blame my partial fancy,
Nothing could resist my Nancy;
But to see her was to love her;
Love but her, and love forever.
Had we never lov'd say kindly,
Had we never lov'd say blindly,
Never met--or never parted--
We had ne'er been broken-hearted.
Fare thee well, thou first and fairest!
Fare thee well, thou best and dearest!
Thine be like a joy and treasure,
Peace. enjoyment, love, and pleasure!

A farewell, alas, forever!
Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee,
Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee!"

The shimmering finger of the moon

As waves invaded and retreated on the shore

Told the age old story
As they strolled beneath the heavens
With its millions of eyes
No voices broke the stillness
Of their evening bliss
The smiles etched on their faces
Only spoke of a stolen kiss"

A kiss, can break the heart of this girl!
A kiss, is like an angel from above!
A kiss, can show all of my love!
A kiss, when it's from him is heaven!
A kiss, is that how it all begins?
A kiss, nothing could be more true!
A kiss, is perfect coming from you!"
260,Emotion,KissPoemsEndsWithAKissPoembydaubmirnadir,"Transience is so immense,
We pass in a flurry of being,
A beautiful moment
In all its suddenness,
Arising in love, or enchanted
In the contraction of work.
And you I possess, however time may
Wear you away.
From I to you
Goes the command
Of infinite space to be assumed
In a single radiating emotion.
Every terrifying angel
Invokes the deadly birds of your soul
Disguising essence made of ecstasy,
Scooping up the finery of beauty
In streams from your upturned face
And gathering it back into themselves.
But I, moved by deep feeling, evaporate
In the mist of want,
And breathe myself out and away
Incapable of retaining your heart,
Splinters of sorrow
Perforating my basic reality.
You’ve entered my bloodstream,
Lover untenable,
The whole springtime
Perfumed with your jasmine flesh
Dissolving my senses in its taste.
Do angels really absorb the tension of love?
So you promise eternity,
From the embrace to the moment of kiss,
At each other's mouth and your lips on mine,
Osculating delight in astonished attachment
To touch one another this potently,
The gods involved in the excess."
261,Emotion,KissPoemsloveAKissPoembyKJaredHosein,"A kiss down by the riverside,
When the waterspouts
Comes to life
And across the evergreen glide.
A kiss with your mouth open wide,
With noses nuzzling
And lying on a foliage mattress
With nothing to hide.
A kiss beneath the harvest moon,
In the wheat and the rye,
When pixies spiral to an eventide rune
'Til the morning Phoenix soars by.
A kiss during a fiery noon
In the fields of midday bloom
And so sings the loon
While petals rise from the gloom.
A kiss, for birds to sing,
For the winter to turn to spring
An exchange of bliss,
A kiss,
To melt a world of snow
In one breath of warm mist."
262,Emotion,KissPoemsJustAKissPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"Just a kiss
of which I cannot dismiss
A kiss of beauty
A kiss of love
A kiss of you and I which make we
In bed I toss and toss
As I wish
for your lips again
to unleash on mine

263,Emotion,KissPoemsKissByKissPoembyJamesMcLain,"The woman full.
The sun it burns.
The earth when wet which scented smells.
Between the collums,
where you stood, I am.
Rising from the mud.
The squelch of sound is of.
The seaweed it is dark it grasps my feet.
Released divine all knowledge,
of some lighter secret?
Pulsing, pulsed it's forced, as it pours out.
Do you as other people touch that feeling?
What kind of sight, first night?
The love of wind is travelling through the air,
and the northern star,
the rainstorm, where the water it is sharp.
Two bodies which become.
Each depending on the others single sweetness.
Kissing you, I kiss the sky,
and by your kiss, I slip once more into the night."

265,Emotion,KissPoemsYourKissPoembyAmandaBristow,"I  can feel your magical touch,
when you kiss me,
I can feel your kiss,
With every bliss,
When you kissed me that afternoon,
I knew you were the one,
Your kiss, made everything right,
Although it scared me a tone,
Your kiss, swept me away,
Like a big powerful wave,
Your kiss, made my day,
I could feel you in every way,
Your kiss, was longed for,
It made me nervous,
Your kiss, lingered within,
It moved me,
Your kiss, remained in my thoughts,
Leaving me wanting more,
Your kiss, consumed me,
In one single moment."
266,Emotion,KissPoemsAKissKissKissPoembyMAsimNehal,"How naïve these mountains are
They are trying to kiss the sky
And feel that the clouds are a hindrance
Every time they make them fall on earth
Something grows and wishes are born
Now these mountains plea
O Sky bow down little and reach me
I want to kiss you like ~
The moonbeams kiss the sea
The bees kiss the flowers
And the waves kiss the shore."
267,Emotion,KissPoemsTheKissPoembyEdithNesbit,"The snow is white on wood and wold,
The wind is in the firs,
So dead my heart is with the cold,
No pulse within it stirs,
Even to see your face, my dear,
Your face that was my sun;
There is no spring this bitter year,
And summer's dreams are done.
The snakes that lie about my heart
Are in their wintry sleep;
Their fangs no more deal sting and smart,
No more they curl and creep.
Love with the summer ceased to be;
The frost is firm and fast.
God keep the summer far from me,
And let the snakes' sleep last!
Touch of your hand could not suffice
To waken them once more;
Nor could the sunshine of your eyes
A ruined spring restore.
But ah-your lips! You know the rest:
The snows are summer rain,
My eyes are wet, and in my breast
The snakes' fangs meet again."
268,Emotion,KissPoemsTheFirstKissPoembyNormanRowlandGale,"On Helen’s heart the day were night!
But I may not adventure there:
Here breast is guarded by a right,
And she is true as fair.
And though in happy days her eyes
The glow within mine own could please,
She’s purer than the babe who cries
For empire on her knees.
Her love is for her lord and child,
And unto them belongs her snow;
But none can rob me of her wild
Young kiss of long ago!"
269,Emotion,KissPoemsTheFirstLuckyBoyToKissYourVirginBreastsPoembyUriahHamilton,"Woman, you are the one who lingers
In my mind with aching tenderness,
But you are hidden in the distance,
Walking through the business world
With your stately shoulders
In a summer dress;
Your smile is brief and suggests
Inner-stirring ideas
For the moment suppressed.
Are your thoughts
All professional and money related?
Or do you drift
Into your young girl affairs
And the first lucky boy
To kiss your virgin breasts?
I would have been
That fortunate and karma-blessed boy
If circumstance and geography
Would have brought me
To the wondrous parks and haunts
Of your girlhood dreams.
It would have been love
And I wouldn’t have lost you
To indelicate or cruel mistakes of time,
I would have cherished your breath
And would have kept you
Like a mystical and sacred locket
Forever next to my heart."
270,Emotion,KissPoemsTheKissPoembyArmourQuillHunter,"What's in a kiss; how many there-be...?
'So many, it boggles the mind's reality…'
A kiss can be a greeting- “of body and soul-! '
It's an unspoken language, telling more than “what's told.”
It is sometimes “a spark-, ” to light one's flame…
Or often “self-flattery” to play one's game.
There's the 'kiss of friendship-, '
The 'kiss of guile…, '
The 'kiss of SINCERITY, '
The 'kiss of style…, '
There's the 'kiss of Life” and the 'kiss of Death! '
There's the 'kiss that steals one's breath away…”
And one “that prays it will last all day! ”
There's the 'kiss that frees the soul…'
Also one that 'detours from one's goal…! '
There's the kiss of a parent, the “kiss of a child…, ”
The “kiss of curiosity- running wild…! ”
The kiss of respect; and a kiss of shame…,
A kiss of honor- and “a kiss to tame…! ”
There's a kiss of the reserved-, “perceived amorous- (the same): ”
A kiss of 'the insecure-, ' to win their ball game!
There's a 'kiss of the stagnant; ' the 'kiss of the free…! ”
Also a 'kiss of those secure-, ” as the best there can be…
Yet what's in a kiss-, that's the question still…?
Maybe, it's how we perceive it to be-,
A reflection of “our state-of-mind…! ”
But; there's the kiss of harmony…
A kiss that divides…
A kiss that is honest…
And a kiss that hides….
There's a kiss of the clever…
A kiss of the mundane…
There's “a kiss like a symphony-, ” with rapturous refrain…!
There’s a plane where “Mercy and Truth meet intimately in bliss; ”
In the plumbline-address, where “Righteousness and Peace kiss! ”
Yet 'still-in-all-, ' maybe the question should be-,
Not 'what's in a kiss” but “what’s in the Kisser, ' you see…"
271,Emotion,KissPoemsFirstKissLastKissPoembySusanAsh,"The warmth of his body
Flows through his touch,
Enfolding me in his universe.
I look deep
To catch a glimpse
Of his soul.
Feels he has already
Seen and taken
Possession of mine.
I drink in his breath,
A sweet nectar
Invading my body.
Melt in to him,
Eager surrender …….
Then disappointment.
They couldn’t
Match my ardour,
Didn’t understand it.
Wished I had
Feigned reluctance,
Been my seducers,
Felt special,
The conquerors.
He doesn’t know!
He was special.
Did seduce me,
Conquer me
Long ago ……
The first time
He looked
Into my eyes.
No forgiveness.
Aware of disapproval,
My passion rejected,
The moment is lost.
Already history."
272,Emotion,KissPoemsKissMeAgainLikeWetDogsPoembyUriahHamilton,"I love you in the rain
Walking lonely along the boulevard
Gazing at all the passing cars;
The glimmer of neon signs
Flash like batting eyes from drugstores.
Neither of us were ever concerned with crime,
Our thoughts were bathed in the sublime
As we made our way down dirty streets,
Somehow a paradise for the lost;
Kiss me again like wet dogs
Straying without hope
Blindly into the night.
You know my addiction for extinction
And everyway I tried to die;
We dug Kierkegaard as well as the philosophy
Of non-judgment and non-injury;
And the poetry of romantic defeat
Was oozing from my pores like sweat
And I was glad you were next to me
To relish the journey of splintered thoughts
Blooming into a bouquet of dangerous dreams."
273,Emotion,KissPoemsKissOfAnAngelPoembykellyberry,"They were a soft kiss that he felt on his lips.
The kiss was gentle and made him fell warm.
The kiss made him fell safe and secure.

Even then this angel who kiss him disappeared.
He knows that deep in his heart.
He had a kiss of an angel in his heart."

Tend'rest pledge of future bliss,
Dearest tie of young connections,

Passion's birth, and infants' play,

Glowing dawn of brighter day.
Sorrowing joy, adieu's last action,
Ling'ring lips, -- no more to join!
What words can ever speak affection
Thrilling and sincere as thine!"

Kissing slowly is better than faster
Kiss me slowly
Kiss me tenderly
Kiss me sweetly
Kiss me on the lips
Down to my finger tips
Delicately sample my nipples
Kiss it, tease it, rather simple
When done right, let me be precise
Kissing itself can be rather very nice
Kiss me slowly
Kiss me tenderly
Kiss me sweetly
Kiss my body inch by inch
Till it tickles and starts to flinch
Kiss me in the left and right ear
Whisper sweet words of passionate care
Kiss me by the neck
With little kisses called pecks
Kiss me hungrily in the mouth
Hear my groaning delicious shouts
Kiss me below and yonder
Till my juices begin to ponder
And turn on fire with desire
Kiss me slowly
Kiss me tenderly
Kiss me sweetly
Kiss me once, twice, thrice
Oooo! These kisses are very nice

Drenching my mouth
In the pastels - tints
Of its passing,
Absorbing every touch of its colour

And I penetrate
Across its variety,
Pages of you
To become only
The small particle
Drinking from your mouth
My own soul"

283,Emotion,KissPoemsFirstKissPoembyShellyPrice,"Closed eyes can see,
lips upon lips.
Thoughts empty of resistence,
bodies filled with urgency.
Hunger turns into a beast,
without hesitation.
Closer than close,
lips brush lips.
Electricity surges,
lightning strikes the sky.
Tongues seductively dance,
harmonous with the sounds of lust.
Passion consumes,
lips tasting, feeling, teasing, yearning,
urgent to satisfy the starvation of time.
Tongues gently licking wet lips,
sucking.
Bodies are alive,
buring with heat.
All reason cast aside.
The sheer pleasure of a oneness,
feverish,  passionate, wanting more.
More pleasure,
more hot steamy,
wet tongues flickering.
Slowly parting gazing eye to eye,
the purist truths exposed.
Nothing hidden in the instant
that we first kissed."
284,Emotion,KissPoemsTheAngelsKissPoembyBanjoPaterson,"An angel stood beside the bed
Where lay the living and the dead.
He gave the mother -- her who died --
A kiss that Christ the Crucified
Had sent to greet the weary soul
When, worn and faint, it reached its goal.
He gave the infant kisses twain,
One on the breast, one on the brain.
""Go forth into the world,"" he said,
""With blessings on your heart and head,
""For God, who ruleth righteously,
Hath ordered that to such as be
""From birth deprived of mother's love,
I bring His blessing from above;
""But if the mother's life he spare
Then she is made God's messenger
""To kiss and pray that heart and brain
May go through life without a stain.""
The infant moved towards the light,
The angel spread his wings in flight.
But each man carries to his grave
The kisses that in hopes to save
The angel or his mother gave."

But you can’t delay
You be gone forever
People remember your deeds
In our heart you will live forever
You will be always in our dreams
You have left our footprints
Prints of love in our heart
And will stay there till our end
Miserable I am, without my sweetheart
The only constant the only truth
To leave behind all you achieved
If you been here someday you have to leave
Everything it takes the kiss of death
The only constant, the only truth
Kiss of death, death it is…….."
286,Emotion,KissPoemsAKissMayMeanAnythingPoembysamuelnze,"One must not take love wrongly
A kiss may mean anything
Emotion gets physical in different ways
If planted on the head
Think of me always
Is a likely import for a kiss
Planted on the cheeks it calls
For fraternity even in strain
On the back of the hand
What other meaning than adoration
For the one beloved
Or on the feet unreserved worship indeed
It is only when a man
Kisses his wife full on the lips
That romance is exclusively expressed
They lock in passionate embrace
Tumbling to the floor
In throes of devouring passion
Making bashful sounds they will disdain
In the somberness of morning
It is not so I feel for my best friend
With him every touch
Is only a call to truer fraternity
That one heart may sincerely love the other
As unto itself."

like that, without sorrow,
and a pat on the back
showing on the right track

I received on the morrow: -
so why would she pack
and the taxi fare borrow?
3 August 1991
Coppers Killed Me
Coppers killed me when we met,
jumping on the tube I sat in;
Magistrate, who loves to get
treats into your list, put that in!
Say I fought the terror fad,
say that “conscience clear” describes me,
say you’re growing old, don’t add, -
Coppers missed me!
Coppers killed me when we met,
hitting on the seat I sat in;
Acting circumstantial bet
eight hits, three misses, put that in!
Say I sought no terror fad,
say that “from bombs free” describes me,
say I’m growing cold, don’t add, -
Coppers killed me!
../..
Error wracks me today,
terror tracks you tomorrow,
let it be as it may,
pain from plain clothes turned grey.
Should tomorrow replay
such a savour of sorrow: -
what for you, safe today, -
is in store for tomorrow?
I could never fire back
like that, without sorrow,
and eight bullets through back
showed after attack
on the Stockwell tube track.
The report on the morrow: -
was on the wrong tack
did from fantasy borrow!
Terror slew me today,
error you risk tomorrow!
Violence came into play
which my life did waylay -
do you share the dismay
at what might come tomorrow?
There’ll be devil to pay
what excuse will YOU borrow?

And also my ardent prayer.

This dream has just melted away.

awkwardly natural)

Yeah...right!
I start to say:

299,Emotion,KissPoemsAKissPoembyDavidTaylor,"Sweetness is on your lips
like honey flavoured early morning dew.
And your eyes have a depth of blue
that even deepest oceans cannot match
with a twinkling like the stars that flash
across the space between
in which our sight it seems is seen.
And your hair as in a gentle breeze
It takes each fine strand and wisps it
on the air as if a string that music makes
deep within, a heartfelt ring.
And your smile a glowing
and in its glowing knowing
that this is true love that’s surely flowing.
Our eyes melt into one
and lips they coalesce
arms embrace entwined.
Love flows and joins
and what seemed a seeming two
are known as one, no longer me and you.
And all the Angels stop and stare
the stars in their travels pause
the sands of time suspend their race
the universe so vast in space
becomes a very tiny place.
Because love flows and joins
this is Love’s gift to all
to know you are so vast, not small
joined in abundant bliss
that’s truly universal
and found in just one loving kiss."
300,Emotion,FriendPoemsAConfessionToAFriendInTroublePoembyThomasHardy,"YOUR troubles shrink not, though I feel them less
Here, far away, than when I tarried near;
I even smile old smiles--with listlessness--
Yet smiles they are, not ghastly mockeries mere.
A thought too strange to house within my brain
Haunting its outer precincts I discern:
--That I will not show zeal again to learn
Your griefs, and, sharing them, renew my pain....
It goes, like murky bird or buccaneer
That shapes its lawless figure on the main,
And each new impulse tends to make outflee
The unseemly instinct that had lodgment here;
Yet, comrade old, can bitterer knowledge be
Than that, though banned, such instinct was in me!"
301,Emotion,FriendPoemsOnTheReligiousMemoryOfMrsCatherineThomsonMyChristianFriendDeceasedDec161646PoembyJohnMilton,"When Faith and Love, which parted from thee never,
Had ripened thy just soul to dwell with God,
Meekly thou didst resign this earthly load
Of death, called life, which us from life doth sever.
Thy works, and alms, and all thy good endeavour,
Stayed not behind, nor in the grave were trod;
But, as Faith pointed with her golden rod,
Followed thee up to joy and bliss for ever.
Love led them on; and Faith, who knew them best
Thy handmaids, clad them o’er with purple beams
And azure wings, that up they flew so drest,
And speak the truth of thee on glorious themes
Before the Judge; who henceforth bid thee rest,
And drink thy fill of pure immortal streams."
302,Emotion,FriendPoemsATrueFriendPoembySamanthaGlovier,"A true friend is someone who will always be,
always be there when a friend is in need.
A true friend is someone who will see the
things that you see and never disrespect you
for what you believe.
A true friend will be there from the start
and gives you their whole heart.
A true friend will never push you away and
they only say things that will make you stay.
A true friend will make you feel warm inside
and not cold like a true winters night.
I am so glad I can call you a true friend,
for you have done all the things that make
you my friend."
303,Emotion,FriendPoemsToHisNobleFriendMrRichardLovelaceUponHisPoemsPoembyAndrewMarvell,"Sir,
Our times are much degenerate from those
Which your sweet muse with your fair fortune chose,
And as complexions alter with the climes,
Our wits have drawn the infection of our times.
That candid age no other way could tell
To be ingenious, but by speaking well.
Who best could praise had then the greatest praise,
'Twas more esteemed to give than bear the bays:
Modest ambition studied only then
To honour not herself but worthy men.
These virtues now are banished out of town,
Our Civil Wars have lost the civic crown.
He highest builds, who with most art destroys,
And against others' fame his own employs.
I see the envious caterpillar sit
On the fair blossom of each growing wit.
The air's already tainted with the swarms
Of insects which against you rise in arms:
Word-peckers, paper-rats, book-scorpions,
Of wit corrupted, the unfashioned sons.
The barbèd censurers begin to look
Like the grim consistory on thy book;
And on each line cast a reforming eye,
Severer than the young presbytery.
Till when in vain they have thee all perused,
You shall, for being faultless, be accused.
Some reading your Lucasta will allege
You wronged in her the House's privelege.
Some that you under sequestration are,
And one the book prohibits, because Kent
Their first petition by the author sent.
But when the beauteous ladies came to know
That their dear Lovelace was endangered so:
Lovelace that thawed the most congealèd breast --
He who loved best and them defended best,
Whose hand so rudely grasps the steely brand,
Whose hand most gently melts the lady's hand --
They all in mutiny though yet undressed
Sallied, and would in his defence contest.
And one, the loveliest that was yet e'er seen,
Thinking that I too of the rout had been,
Mine eyes invaded with a female spite,
(She knew what pain 'twould cause to lose that sight.)
`O no, mistake not,' I replied, `for I
In your defence, or in his cause, would die.'
But he, secure of glory and of time,
Above their envy, or mine aid, doth climb.
Him valiant'st men and fairest nymphs approve;
His book in them finds judgement, with you love."
304,Emotion,FriendPoemsAParanaeticallOrAdvisiveVersetoHisFriendMrJohnWicksPoembyRobertHerrick,"Is this a life, to break thy sleep,
To rise as soon as day doth peep?
To tire thy patient ox or ass
By noon, and let thy good days pass,
Not knowing this, that Jove decrees
Some mirth, t' adulce man's miseries?
--No; 'tis a life to have thine oil
Without extortion from thy soil;
Thy faithful fields to yield thee grain,
Although with some, yet little pain;
To have thy mind, and nuptial bed,
With fears and cares uncumbered
A pleasing wife, that by thy side
Lies softly panting like a bride;
--This is to live, and to endear
Those minutes Time has lent us here.
Then, while fates suffer, live thou free,
As is that air that circles thee;
And crown thy temples too; and let
Thy servant, not thy own self, sweat,
To strut thy barns with sheaves of wheat.
--Time steals away like to a stream,
And we glide hence away with them:
No sound recalls the hours once fled,
Or roses, being withered;
Nor us, my friend, when we are lost,
Like to a dew, or melted frost.
--Then live we mirthful while we should,
And turn the iron age to gold;
Let's feast and frolic, sing and play,
And thus less last, than live our day.
Whose life with care is overcast,
That man's not said to live, but last;
Nor is't a life, seven years to tell,
But for to live that half seven well;
And that we'll do, as men who know,
Some few sands spent, we hence must go,
Both to be blended in the urn,
From whence there's never a return."

Well, such you are,—but well enough we know
How thick about us root, how rankly grow
Those subtle weeds no man has need to tend,
That flourish through neglect, and soon must send
Perfume too sweet upon us and overthrow
Our steady senses; how such matters go
We are aware, and how such matters end.
Yet shall be told no meagre passion here;
With lovers such as we forevermore
Isolde drinks the draught, and Guinevere
Receives the Table's ruin through her door,
Francesca, with the loud surf at her ear,
Lets fall the colored book upon the floor."
306,Emotion,FriendPoemsYourFriendAFriendForLifetimePoembyFrancisDuggan,"Acquaintances are many but friends are very rare
For with a true and trusting friend your secrets you can share
Your friend will comfort you and advise you and you will not betray
Your friend will never disown you and as your friend will stay
When others do not wish to know you your friend as your friend remain
And feel lucky in your lifetime if one loyal friend you gain
Your friend will always stand by you no matter come what may
And when you ask your friend for help your friend will not turn you away
No your friend will stand by you when you are feeling down
When others shun you as if you were an outcast of the town
Acquaintances like Nature's Seasons they come to your life and go
But your friend a friend for lifetime and the bond of friendship grow
And the one who betrays your trust could never be your friend
Your friend to you is ever true and one on whom you can depend."

Though lesser lives should suffer.  Such am I,
A lesser life, that what is his of sky
Gladly would give for you, and what of praise.
Step, without trouble, down the sunlit ways.
We that have touched your raiment, are made whole
From all the selfish cankers of man's soul,
And we would see you happy, dear, or die.
Therefore be brave, and therefore, dear, be free;
Try all things resolutely, till the best,
Out of all lesser betters, you shall find;
And we, who have learned greatness from you, we,
Your lovers, with a still, contented mind,
See you well anchored in some port of rest."
309,Emotion,FriendPoemsToAFriendGoingBlindPoembyJorieGraham,"Today, because I couldn't find the shortcut through,
I had to walk this town's entire inner
perimeter to find
where the medieval walls break open
in an eighteenth century
arch. The yellow valley flickered on and off
through cracks and the gaps
for guns. Bruna is teaching me
to cut a pattern.
Saturdays we buy the cloth.
She takes it in her hands
like a good idea, feeling
for texture, grain, the built-in
limits. It's only as an afterthought she asks
and do you think it's beautiful?
Her measuring tapes hang down, corn-blond and endless,
from her neck.
When I look at her
I think Rapunzel,
how one could climb that measuring,
that love. But I was saying,
I wandered all along the street that hugs the walls,
a needle floating
on its cloth. Once
I shut my eyes and felt my way
along the stone. Outside
is the cashcrop, sunflowers, as far as one can see. Listen,
the wind rattles in them,
a loose worship
seeking an object,
an interruption. Sara,
the walls are beautiful. They block the view.
And it feels rich to be
inside their grasp.
When Bruna finishes her dress
it is the shape of what has come
to rescue her. She puts it on."
310,Emotion,FriendPoemsToAFriendPoembyMatthewArnold,"Who prop, thou ask'st in these bad days, my mind?--
He much, the old man, who, clearest-souled of men,
Saw The Wide Prospect, and the Asian Fen,
And Tmolus hill, and Smyrna bay, though blind.
Much he, whose friendship I not long since won,
That halting slave, who in Nicopolis
Taught Arrian, when Vespasian's brutal son
Cleared Rome of what most shamed him. But be his
My special thanks, whose even-balanced soul,
From first youth tested up to extreme old age,
Business could not make dull, nor passion wild;
Who saw life steadily, and saw it whole;
The mellow glory of the Attic stage,
Singer of sweet Colonus, and its child."
311,Emotion,FriendPoemsACombatFriendPoembyJosephTRenaldi,"I am haplessly entrenched near a road,
Bogged down by the war's heavy load.
Then as I view the skirmish ahead,
My mind is overcome with a dread.
I can not envision what lies beyond,
That curve, that field, that placid pond.
Will I encounter bloodshed, captivity and tears,
Or will I overcome my deeply rooted fears?
Will I feel pain and anxiety within my frame,
Or charge with a vengeance leading to fame?
I grit my teeth, knit my brow and groan,
When suddenly I realize I was not alone.
There beside me was a fearless friend,
A friend on whom I can trust and depend,
To lead me into battle whatever betides,
I smile with confidence and then follow him - my guide."

Oh, the sunset and the longing of an old friend!
We ride away from each other, waving our hands,
While our horses neigh softly, softly . . . ."

That always you will be my dream of you;
That never shall I wake to find untrue
All this I have believed and rested on,
Forever vanished, like a vision gone
Out into the night. Alas, how few
There are who strike in us a chord we knew
Existed, but so seldom heard its tone
We tremble at the half-forgotten sound.
The world is full of rude awakenings
And heaven-born castles shattered to the ground,
Yet still our human longing vainly clings
To a belief in beauty through all wrongs.
O stay your hand, and leave my heart its songs!"

how many splendid plans and fine ideas

We do not see the moment as divine,
thinking that those plans are somehow 'ours';
forgetting, too,  that Providence sublime
yields timeless good through time in human hours:
the task begun, this heavenly Providence
begins to move; bestows her love's support
with means, events, beyond coincidence;
assistance past all dreams of human thought -
be bold! and trust in Providence above:
she brings to earth God's magic; power; and love."

If anybody's friend be dead
It's sharpest of the theme
The thinking how they walked alive—
At such and such a time—
Their costume, of a Sunday,
Some manner of the Hair—
A prank nobody knew but them
Lost, in the Sepulchre—
How warm, they were, on such a day,
You almost feel the date—
So short way off it seems—
And now—they're Centuries from that—
How pleased they were, at what you said—
You try to touch the smile
And dip your fingers in the frost—
When was it—Can you tell—
You asked the Company to tea—
Acquaintance—just a few—
And chatted close with this Grand Thing
That don't remember you—
Past Bows, and Invitations—
Past Interview, and Vow—
Past what Ourself can estimate—
That—makes the Quick of Woe!"

Her love me once, who now hates me."
320,Emotion,FriendPoemsFriend1ShireenIsalMyDearFriendPoembyDrGeetaRadhakrishnaMenon,"We meet many people in life,
Some just appear and disappear too
Like pretty butterflies,
Some stay for a while leaving behind
A sweet-scented fragrance of a flower,
Few stay longer,
Intense friendship while it lasted,
Then, gone suddenly, only
To reminisce as a pleasant memory!
But there are a few,
That you can count on your fingers,
That stay steady and strong,
Firmly rooted like a Peepal tree,
Throughout your life.
One such friend of mine is Shireen Isal!
We met each other professionally
Thirty three years ago,
When I was an aspiring danseuse.
She watched me dance Mohiniattam
And before I knew what was happening in my life,
I was dancing in different parts of Europe-
France, Holland, Belgium, Luxemburg,
Switzerland and England.
If the word ‘Mohiniattam' is known to some in Europe,
It is all because of the effort put in by Shireen.
The credit of popularising and propagating
Indian Classical dance and music in the
European countries, undeniably, goes to her.
Shireen has been one of the pioneers
Promoting the best of Indian artistes in Europe.
In her list of artistes are some great ones
Like Ravi Shankar, Lakshmi Shankar,
Bismillah Khan, Parveen Sultana,
Malvika Sarukkai, Rohinton Cama
And many more.
I was lucky to have her as my Impressario.
We worked together almost till
The end of the 20th century.
The last tour was in 1997,
When my daughter and I danced together
Touring England in celebration of
India's 50 years of Independence.
But the story does not end here.
Shireen and I continued our association
And became very good friends.
Every year when Shireen came down
From London to Mumbai,
We met over lunch,
Talked on every subject of life,
From mundane to high philosophy.
Early this year when we met
She gifted me a book authored by her.
A beautiful book on her French teacher
Zenobia Mistri! A teacher par excellence!
An incentive to write another poem
In my teacher series!
Thank you Shireen, for your faith in me,
And your warm, beautiful friendship!"
321,Emotion,FriendPoemsMyFriendMaryPoembyErnestineNorthover,"On poemhunter I've found a new friend,
Her comments she'll regularly send,
She's boosted my ego
Thus, helping my 'lines' flow
On her I know I can depend.
Her name's Mary Nagy you see,
She could not be nicer to me,
She's open and honest
And one of the bonniest
People.  I know you'll agree.
So I want to now, thank her, for sure,
I hope she won't think me a bore,
But she's such a great mate
To her I can relate,
So I send her best wishes galore.
From your 'adopted' Mom.

322,Emotion,FriendPoemsIfYouHadAFriendPoembyRobertWilliamService,"If you had a friend strong, simple, true,
Who knew your faults and who understood;
Who believed in the very best of you,
And who cared for you as a father would;
Who would stick by you to the very end,
Who would smile however the world might frown:
I'm sure you would try to please your friend,
You never would think to throw him down.
And supposing your friend was high and great,
And he lived in a palace rich and tall,
And sat like a King in shining state,
And his praise was loud on the lips of all;
Well then, when he turned to you alone,
And he singled you out from all the crowd,
And he called you up to his golden throne,
Oh, wouldn't you just be jolly proud?
If you had a friend like this, I say,
So sweet and tender, so strong and true,
You'd try to please him in every way,
You'd live at your bravest -- now, wouldn't you?
His worth would shine in the words you penned;
You'd shout his praises . . . yet now it's odd!
You tell me you haven't got such a friend;
You haven't? I wonder . . . What of God?"

What makes a friend?

Is someone that is always their

The pallid hare that runs before the day
Having brought your earnest counsels to an end
Now have I somewhat of my own to say:
That it is folly to be sunk in love,
And madness plain to make the matter known,
There are no mysteries you are verger of;
Everyman's wisdoms these are, and my own.
If I have flung my heart unto a hound
I have done ill, it is a certain thing;
Yet breathe I freer, walk I the more sound
On my sick bones for this brave reasoning?
Soon must I say, "" 'Tis prowling Death I hear!""
Yet come no better off, for my quick ear."

327,Emotion,FriendPoemsToMyHonorDFriendDrCharletonExcerptPoembyJohnDryden,"The longest tyranny that ever sway'd
Was that wherein our ancestors betray'd
Their free-born reason to the Stagirite,
And made his torch their universal light.
So truth, while only one supplied the state,
Grew scarce, and dear, and yet sophisticate;
Until 't was bought, like emp'ric wares, or charms,
Hard words seal'd up with Aristotle's arms.
Columbus was the first that shook his throne,
And found a temp'rate in a torrid zone:
The fev'rish air fann'd by a cooling breeze,
The fruitful vales set round with shady trees;
And guiltless men, who danc'd away their time,
Fresh as their groves, and happy as their clime.
Had we still paid that homage to a name,
Which only God and Nature justly claim,
The western seas had been our utmost bound,
Where poets still might dream the sun was drown'd:
And all the stars that shine in southern skies
Had been admir'd by none but savage eyes.
Among th' asserters of free reason's claim,
Th' English are not the least in worth, or fame.
The world to Bacon does not only owe
Its present knowledge, but its future too.
Gilbert shall live, till loadstones cease to draw,
Or British fleets the boundless ocean awe.
And noble Boyle, not less in nature seen,
Than his great brother read in states and men.
The circling streams, once thought but pools, of blood
(Whether life's fuel or the body's food),
From dark oblivion Harvey's name shall save;
While Ent keeps all the honour that he gave.

I have a rich almighty friend;
Jesus, the Saviour, is His Name;
He freely loves, and without end.
He ransomed me from hell with blood,
And by His pow'r my foes controlled;
He found me wand'ring far from God,
And brought me to His chosen fold.
He cheers my heart, my wants supplies,
And says that I shall shortly be,
Enthroned with Him above the skies;
O what a friend is Christ to me!
But ah! I my inmost spirit mourns,
And well my eyes with tears may swim,
To think of my perverse returns;
I've been a faithless friend to him.
Often my gracious Friend I grieve,
Neglect, distrust, and disobey,
And often Satan's lies believe,
Sooner than all my Friend can say.
He bids me always freely come,
And promises whate'er I ask:
But I am straitened, cold and dumb,
And count my privilege a task.
Before the world that hates his course,
My treach'rous heart has throbbed with shame;
Loth to forego the worlds applause,
I hardly dare avow his name.
Sure were not I most vile and base,
I could not thus my friend requite!
And were not he the God of grace,
He'd frown and spurn me from his sight."

He joked and I joked too,
He smiled and took away despair,
And with it, the doldrums flew.
He raised my spirits upwards,
And left no dread behind,
He was the perfect anecdote,
He was so sweet and kind.
The heart can become heavy,
With all the pressures found,
And when this starts to happen,
You need him to be around.
We all need some uplifting,
We all need light relief,
If one can do this for someone,
It's a gift beyond belief.

thy course to come to me, my friend?"

My friend must be a Bird—

335,Emotion,FriendPoemsLastWordsToADumbFriendPoembyThomasHardy,"Pet was never mourned as you,
Purrer of the spotless hue,
Plumy tail, and wistful gaze
While you humoured our queer ways,
Or outshrilled your morning call
Up the stairs and through the hall -
Foot suspended in its fall -
While, expectant, you would stand
Arched, to meet the stroking hand;
Till your way you chose to wend
Yonder, to your tragic end.
Never another pet for me!
Let your place all vacant be;
Better blankness day by day
Than companion torn away.
Better bid his memory fade,
Better blot each mark he made,
Selfishly escape distress
By contrived forgetfulness,
Than preserve his prints to make
Every morn and eve an ache.
From the chair whereon he sat
Sweep his fur, nor wince thereat;
Rake his little pathways out
Mid the bushes roundabout;
Smooth away his talons’ mark
From the claw-worn pine-tree bark,
Where he climbed as dusk embrowned,
Waiting us who loitered round.
Strange it is this speechless thing,
Subject to our mastering,
Subject for his life and food
To our gift, and time, and mood;
Timid pensioner of us Powers,
His existence ruled by ours,
Should - by crossing at a breath
Into safe and shielded death,
By the merely taking hence
Of his insignificance -
Loom as largened to the sense,
Shape as part, above man’s will,
Of the Imperturbable.
As a prisoner, flight debarred,
Exercising in a yard,
Still retain I, troubled, shaken,
Mean estate, by him forsaken;
And this home, which scarcely took
Impress from his little look,
By his faring to the Dim
Grows all eloquent of him.
Housemate, I can think you still
Bounding to the window-sill,
Over which I vaguely see
Your small mound beneath the tree,
Showing in the autumn shade
That you moulder where you played."
336,Emotion,FriendPoemsToHisHonouredAndMostIngeniousFriendMrCharlesCottonPoembyRobertHerrick,"For brave comportment, wit without offence,
Words fully flowing, yet of influence:
Thou art that man of men, the man alone,
Worthy the public admiration:
Who with thine own eyes read'st what we do write,
And giv'st our numbers euphony, and weight.
Tell'st when a verse springs high, how understood
To be, or not born of the Royal blood.
What state above, what symmetry below,
Lines have, or should have, thou the best canst show.
For which (my Charles) it is my pride to be,
Not so much known, as to be loved by thee.
Long may I live so, and my wreath of bays,
Be less another's laurel, than thy praise."
337,Emotion,FriendPoemsMyBestFriendPoembyRaviSathasivam,"There is a miracle called in friendship
That miracle of friendship brought you
as my dearest friend
I have so many friends
but you are the only one impressed in my mind and heart
I know you are the most valuable gift for me
and it's my pleasure to have you as my dear friend
Your friendship is a precious gift to be cherished and natured
Your friendship is reflect on me who you are
There are so many friends come and go
but precious friend like you I can hold on it
You are like a star very far from me
but I know you are there for me
I can remember some one told me that
'Friends are born but not made'
Yes, we are born for each other
Let me be what I know best
my friend that's always known ' my best friend'."

Don’t be rigid; just go with a flow...'
'Be like water' - you asked me. 'Don't hold to me.
I am leaving, so please let me go.'
'Water is shapeless, my friend, water is flowing
Water is moving; and it cannot die...
It may freeze sometimes, when it gets too cold,
But you know, the spring will arrive.'
***
I’m becoming shapeless, I’m becoming fluid,
I am listening to what you say...
I got frozen, my friend, by your sudden coldness
But I’m finding through cracks my new way.

Now I am floating, again. I am glowing.
I’m reflecting the sun and the sky...
And sometimes the clouds. And the wind is blowing...
I’m already far away...Just stopped to wave 'Good Bye! '

I was looking for a brother

I am sharing for a life

I am trusting a brother

I am talking to a friend

I am looking at his eyes

I am sharing for a life

I sing the more, that thou hast one;
To whose glad threshold, and free door
I may a Poet come, though poor;
And eat with thee a savoury bit,
Paying but common thanks for it.
--Yet should I chance, my Wicks, to see
An over-leaven look in thee,
To sour the bread, and turn the beer
To an exalted vinegar;
Or should'st thou prize me as a dish
Of thrice-boil'd worts, or third-day's fish,
I'd rather hungry go and come
Than to thy house be burdensome;
Yet, in my depth of grief, I'd be
One that should drop his beads for thee."

This new friendship."

And high-bred horses to fetch me.
I decline the invitation of
My old poetry and wine companion.
I remember the happy days in the lost capital.
We took our ease in the woman's quarters.
The Feast of Lanterns was elaborately celebrated -
Folded pendants, emerald hairpins, brocaded girdles,
New sashes - we competed
To see who was most smartly dressed.
Now I am withering away,
Wind-blown hair, frost temples.
I prefer to stay beyond the curtains,
And listen to talk and laughter
I can no longer share."

347,Emotion,FriendPoemsMyImaginaryFriendChildrenPoembyCJHeck,"My friend, Sherla, was hard to see
for Mom and Dad, not me.
My imaginary friend was all I had.
I’m an only child, you see.
Most times Sherla was really good.
We did puzzles, read, and played.
We made our beds and cleaned our room
ALMOST every single day.
But sometimes Sherla spilled my milk,
sometimes she wrote on walls,
sometimes she told me not to come
when Mom and Daddy called.
I had to have a talk with her
about being a naughty kid,
cause I’m the one who got time out
for all the things she did.
It’s different now, I go to school
and I have friends everywhere.
Sherla doesn’t come here now
and I thought I she didn’t care.
Mom told me Sherla’s ‘special’
cause only I could see,
but now she lives with someone else
who needs her more than me."

He is lovely and cute light ray

Pure light who guides my path.

But I see him near as he dwells
Inside my heart in each beat
I see he writes love and sings.
He is friend of far a star light
He is super and powerful I love
I know he is ever true and eternal
He remains far and still holds me.
We shake hands of wisdom near him
He comes and we go with him home
Really very precious friend he is
I am and you are all fortunate dear."

I try to be brave
But I can't stop the tears
When I visit His grave
Can He be replaced
I don't see how
He was my buddy
He was my pal
I am lonely at home
I am lonely at school
I miss my friend
He was so cool
I go to the park
I try to play ball
But is's not the same
Not at all
My minds a mess
My minds a haze
Lonely nights
And lonely days
I want my friend
I want Him back
The death of a friend
He's not coming back."
350,Emotion,FriendPoemsToAFriendWhoSentMeSomeRosesPoembyJohnKeats,"As late I rambled in the happy fields,
What time the skylark shakes the tremulous dew
From his lush clover covert;—when anew
Adventurous knights take up their dinted shields;
I saw the sweetest flower wild nature yields,
A fresh-blown musk-rose; 'twas the first that threw
Its sweets upon the summer: graceful it grew
As is the wand that Queen Titania wields.
And, as I feasted on its fragrancy,
I thought the garden-rose it far excelled;
But when, O Wells! thy roses came to me,
My sense with their deliciousness was spelled:
Soft voices had they, that with tender plea
Whispered of peace, and truth, and friendliness unquelled."
351,Emotion,FriendPoemsAFriendIsPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"A friend is one who is like me,
or is it one who likes me much,
and maybe someone you can touch?
Perhaps a buddy who would be
in all dark alleys in your need
who'd fish you out of murky waters
and bandage when you slowly bleed
he will protect your sons and daughters
and close the shutters on your house
when rains come down to soil the drapes
a friend will never bring a mouse
or other things like living apes
to scare you out of any wits
that you may still possess today
he will collect you from the pits
and hug you even if you're gay
he'll pay your fare on the express
and go to jail to take your place
and cleaning up of any mess
that you've created, to save face
will all be done without  agenda
no thought of payment does come up
and should you have a fender-bender
he'll hide your bottle from the cop
when very strange ideas come visit
and you decide to pack a shute
to jump, a nut's idea, or is it?
out of an aeroplane you brute
he will be waiting on the ground
his arms wide open and so nervous
and when he hears the crucial sound
he'll think back to his airforce service
and knowing what can go awry
the fretting gets his teeth to clatter
and when you fruitcake finally fly
he murmurs that it doesn't matter
yet as you float in to a landing
his arms are still in catching mode
he'll hide his lack of understanding
and start composing a new ode
to your adventure,  you, the friend
and if your mother or your brother
or any other next of kin
should die and leave you, let another
example of true friendship win
your hand will never feel the cold
or loneliness of cruel fate
and when you wake and have grown old
and all the world is in a state
that narrows down to search of gold
and greed that tramples all that's good
when anarchy eats moral pillars
and thieves no longer wear their hood
when doctors have evolved as killers
and no one seems to give a shit
about all others, beast and man
when humans are no longer fit
your friend who also has his clan
will not be busy with his life
but shake your hand and not let go
and if he has his own sweet wife
he will be there with her in tow
One could go on for many hours
to praise what real friendship is
suffice to say it never sours
and also hardly counts as bliss.
Yet, there are just a few small matters
a friend will stand, no reservation
and if the world is all in tatters
if aliens would attack your nation
there is no compromise at all
and loyalty must be extreme
to share it one will surely fall
that kind of friend is just a dream.
I cannot have a friend who likes
those who have sworn to be my foes
and who would drive their filthy spikes
into my back, who also chose
to live a life of pure decay
and without honour in their hearts
to opportunism they pray
it must be said, it really smarts.
Perhaps a moral could be seen here
before you call yourself a friend
just ask yourself if you have been there
to read these words that don't offend
are you prepared to stand, be counted
no matter what the circumstance
and would you, if the devil mounted
all out attack, could you by chance
be trusted to the road's last bend
or would you stop and smell the flowers
and worry that your life may end
this kind of friendship only sours.
So let me say it with conviction
a friend is one who is your master
who rules within his jurisdiction
and keeps you out of all disaster
and you, in turn are his dictator
who, firm and strict, with iron fist
will rule like Arn the Terminator
I hope by now you get my gist."
352,Emotion,FriendPoemsToMyDearFriendMrCongreveOnHisCommedyCallDTheDoubleDealerPoembyJohnDryden,"Well then; the promis'd hour is come at last;
The present age of wit obscures the past:
Strong were our sires; and as they fought they writ,
Conqu'ring with force of arms, and dint of wit;
Theirs was the giant race, before the Flood;
And thus, when Charles return'd, our empire stood.
Like Janus he the stubborn soil manur'd,
With rules of husbandry the rankness cur'd:
Tam'd us to manners, when the stage was rude;
And boisterous English wit, with art endu'd.
Our age was cultivated thus at length;
But what we gained in skill we lost in strength.
Our builders were, with want of genius, curst;
The second temple was not like the first:
Till you, the best Vitruvius, come at length;
Our beauties equal; but excel our strength.
Firm Doric pillars found your solid base:
The fair Corinthian crowns the higher space;
Thus all below is strength, and all above is grace.
In easy dialogue is Fletcher's praise:
He mov'd the mind, but had not power to raise.
Great Jonson did by strength of judgment please:
Yet doubling Fletcher's force, he wants his ease.
In differing talents both adorn'd their age;
One for the study, t'other for the stage.
But both to Congreve justly shall submit,
One match'd in judgment, both o'er-match'd in wit.
In him all beauties of this age we see;
Etherege's courtship, Southern's purity;
The satire, wit, and strength of manly Wycherly.
All this in blooming youth you have achiev'd;
Nor are your foil'd contemporaries griev'd;
So much the sweetness of your manners move,
We cannot envy you because we love.
Fabius might joy in Scipio, when he saw
A beardless Consul made against the law,
And join his suffrage to the votes of Rome;
Though he with Hannibal was overcome.
Thus old Romano bow'd to Raphael's fame;
And scholar to the youth he taught, became.
Oh that your brows my laurel had sustain'd,
Well had I been depos'd, if you had reign'd!
The father had descended for the son;
For only you are lineal to the throne.
Thus when the State one Edward did depose;
A greater Edward in his room arose.
But now, not I, but poetry is curs'd;
For Tom the second reigns like Tom the first.
But let 'em not mistake my patron's part;
Nor call his charity their own desert.
Yet this I prophesy; thou shalt be seen,
(Tho' with some short parenthesis between
High on the throne of wit; and seated there,
Not mine (that's little) but thy laurel wear.
Thy first attempt an early promise made;
That early promise this has more than paid.
So bold, yet so judiciously you dare,
That your least praise, is to be regular.
Time, place, and action, may with pains be wrought,
But genius must be born; and never can be taught.
This is your portion; this your native store;
Heav'n that but once was prodigal before,
To Shakespeare gave as much; she could not give him more.
Maintain your post: that's all the fame you need;
For 'tis impossible you should proceed.
Already I am worn with cares and age;
And just abandoning th' ungrateful stage:
Unprofitably kept at Heav'n's expense,
I live a rent-charge on his providence:
But you, whom ev'ry muse and grace adorn,
Whom I foresee to better fortune born,
Be kind to my remains; and oh defend,
Against your judgment your departed friend!
Let not the insulting foe my fame pursue;
But shade those laurels which descend to you:
And take for tribute what these lines express:
You merit more; nor could my love do less."
353,Emotion,FriendPoemsToAFriendConcerningSeveralLadiesPoembyWilliamCarlosWilliams,"You know there is not much
that I desire, a few chrysanthemums
half lying on the grass, yellow
and brown and white, the
talk of a few people, the trees,
an expanse of dried leaves perhaps
with ditches among them.
But there comes
between me and these things
a letter
or even a look--well placed,
you understand,
so that I am confused, twisted
four ways and--left flat,
unable to lift the food to
my own mouth:
Here is what they say: Come!
and come! and come! And if
I do not go I remain stale to
myself and if I go--
I have watched
the city from a distance at night
and wondered why I wrote no poem.
Come! yes,
the city is ablaze for you
and you stand and look at it.
And they are right. There is
no good in the world except out of
a woman and certain women alone
for certain. But what if
I arrive like a turtle,
with my house on my back or
a fish ogling from under water?
It will not do. I must be
steaming with love, colored
like a flamingo. For what?
To have legs and a silly head
and to smell, pah! like a flamingo
that soils its own feathers behind.
Must I go home filled
with a bad poem?
And they say:
Who can answer these things
till he has tried? Your eyes
are half closed, you are a child,
oh, a sweet one, ready to play
but I will make a man of you and
with love on his shoulder--!
And in the marshes
the crickets run
on the sunny dike's top and
make burrows there, the water
reflects the reeds and the reeds
move on their stalks and rattle drily."
354,Emotion,FriendPoemsAFriendInNeedIsAFriendIndeedPoembyRajaramRamachandran,"Two friends went to a forest.
One was very much honest,
And the other one was very bad,
Daily, for their livelihood.
One day, they saw a wild bear,
Almost coming close, very near.
The bad man climbed a nearby tree,
But the other one couldn't reach the tree.
He lied below the tree, posing as dead,
As he knew well, bears touch not any dead.
Without moving his limbs, he held his breath.
The bear smelt his body lying in close to death.
After it went away without harming him,
The man from the tree asked him,
What the bear whispered into his ears,
When he remained with closed eyes?
'The bear told me not to trust such
Selfish friends like you, very much,
And also said that a friend in need,
Is really a friend in deed.'"
355,Emotion,FriendPoemsFriendInTheDesolateTimePoembyErikJohanStagnelius,"Friend, in the desolate time, when your soul is enshrouded in darkness
When, in a deep abyss, memory and feeling die out,
Intellect timidly gropes among shadowy forms and illusions
Heart can no longer sigh, eye is unable to weep;
When, from your night-clouded soul the wings of fire have fallen
And you, to nothing, afraid, feel yourself sinking once more,
Say, who rescues you then?—Who is the comforting angel
Brings to your innermost soul order and beauty again,
Building once more your fragmented world, restoring the fallen
Altar, and when it is raised, lighting the sacred flame?-—
None but the powerful being who first from the limitless darkness
Kissed to life seraphs and woke numberless suns to their dance.
None but the holy Word who called the worlds into existence
And in whose power the worlds move on their paths to this day.
Therefore, rejoice, oh friend, and sing in the darkness of sorrow:
Night is the mother of day, Chaos the neighbor of God."

In the cold and silent tomb.
He is resting, sweetly resting

He has left us, God bereft us,
And his will must e'er be done,
It will grieve us, and bereave us

While on earth he done his duty,
To all his fellow men,
Some will miss him in his of office,
Where he often used the pen.
He was witty, always happy,
Kind and genial in his way;
He was generous in his actions,
And his honor could display.
He has held many an office,
And has done his duty well;
And his name will be remembered
By the friends that knew him well.
Friends are weeping, softly weeping,
In his kind and loving home;
Let him slumber, sweetly slumber,
Till God calls him from the tomb."

I should not dare to leave my friend,
Because—because if he should die
While I was gone—and I—too late—
Should reach the Heart that wanted me—
If I should disappoint the eyes
That hunted—hunted so—to see—
And could not bear to shut until
They ""noticed"" me—they noticed me—
If I should stab the patient faith
So sure I'd come—so sure I'd come—
It listening—listening—went to sleep—
Telling my tardy name—
My Heart would wish it broke before—
Since breaking then—since breaking then—
Were useless as next morning's sun—
Where midnight frosts—had lain!"

A Prison gets to be a friend—
Between its Ponderous face
And Ours—a Kinsmanship express—
And in its narrow Eyes—
We come to look with gratitude
For the appointed Beam
It deal us—stated as our food—
And hungered for—the same—
We learn to know the Planks—
That answer to Our feet—
So miserable a sound—at first—
Nor ever now—so sweet—
As plashing in the Pools—
When Memory was a Boy—
But a Demurer Circuit—
A Geometric Joy—
The Posture of the Key
That interrupt the Day
To Our Endeavor—Not so real
The Check of Liberty—
As this Phantasm Steel—
Whose features—Day and Night—
Are present to us—as Our Own—
And as escapeless—quite—
The narrow Round—the Stint—
The slow exchange of Hope—
For something passiver—Content
Too steep for lookinp up—
The Liberty we knew
Avoided—like a Dream—
Too wide for any Night but Heaven—
If That—indeed—redeem—"
368,Emotion,FriendPoemsToHisWorthyFriendDoctorWittyUponHisTranslationOfThePopularErrorsPoembyAndrewMarvell,"Sit further, and make room for thine own fame,
Where just desert enrolles thy honour'd Name
The good Interpreter. Some in this task
Take of the Cypress vail, but leave a mask,
Changing the Latine, but do more obscure
That sence in English which was bright and pure.
So of Translators they are Authors grown,
For ill Translators make the Book their own.
Others do strive with words and forced phrase
To add such lustre, and so many rayes,
That but to make the Vessel shining, they
Much of the precious Metal rub away.
He is Translations thief that addeth more,
As much as he that taketh from the Store
Of the first Author. Here he maketh blots
That mends; and added beauties are but spots.
Caelia whose English doth more richly flow
Then Tagus, purer then dissolved snow,
And sweet as are her lips that speak it, she
Now learns the tongues of France and Italy;
But she is Caelia still: no other grace
But her own smiles commend that lovely face;
Her native beauty's not Italianated,
Nor her chast mind into the French translated:
Her thoughts are English, though her sparkling wit
With other Language doth them fitly fit.
Translators learn of her: but stay I slide
Down into Error with the Vulgar tide;
Women must not teach here: the Doctor doth
Stint them to Cawdles Almond-milk, and Broth.
Now I reform, and surely so will all
Whose happy Eyes on thy Translation fall,
I see the people hastning to thy Book,
Liking themselves the worse the more they look,
And so disliking, that they nothing see
Now worth the liking, but thy Book and thee.
And (if I Judgement have) I censure right;
For something guides my hand that I must write.
You have Translations statutes best fulfil'd.
That handling neither sully nor would guild"

372,Emotion,FriendPoemsASearchForATrueFriendPoembyGilGregorio,"At the highways of woes
a traveller viewed the wind blows,
as he climb up a fearful trail
on top of a mountain or a hill.
He searched unbearable things
that he wouldn't want to know.
He longed for something unknown
that he wouldn't like to see.
He's cleaving for something unusual
that he wouldn't want to feel.
Now, all the things provided
as he searched on the unprovided!
What is it then that you see
in your naked eyes as it slips away?
What is it then that you feel
in your naked skin as it wards away?
Ah, the only way to a true friend
is the heart with gladness,
willingness to share what is it
treasured deep in his own senses!"
373,Emotion,FriendPoemsStanzasToAFriendPoembyMaryDarbyRobinson,"AH! think no more that Life's delusive joys,
Can charm my thoughts from FRIENDSHIP'S dearer claim;
Or wound a heart, that scarce a wish employs,
For age to censure, or discretion blame.
Tir'd of the world, my weary mind recoils
From splendid scenes, and transitory joys;
From fell Ambition's false and fruitless toils,
From hope that flatters, and from bliss that cloys.
With THEE, above the taunts of empty pride,
The rigid frowns to youthful error given;
Content in solitude my griefs I'll hide,
Thy voice my counsellor­thy smiles my Heaven.
With thee I'll hail the morn's returning ray,
Or climb the dewy mountain bleak and cold;
On the smooth lake observe the sun-beams play,
Or mark the infant flow'rs their buds unfold.
Pleas'd will I watch the glitt'ring queen of Night
Spread her white mantle o'er the face of Heaven;
And from thy converse snatch the pure delight,
By truth sublime to MENTAL feeling given.
And as the varying seasons glide away,
This moral lesson shall my bosom learn,
How TIME steals on, while blissful hours decay
Like fleeting shadows;­NEVER to return.
And when I see thy warm unspotted mind,
Torn with the wound of broken FRIENDSHIP'S dart;
When sickness chills thy breast with pangs unkind,
Or ruthless sorrow preys upon thy heart;
The task be MINE to soothe thee to repose,
To check the sigh, and wipe the trickling tear,
Or with soft SYMPATHY to share thy woes;
O, proudest rapture of the soul sincere !
And ye who flutter thro' the vacant hour,
Where tasteless Apathy's empoison'd wand
Arrests the vagrant sense with numbing pow'r,
While vanquish'd REASON bows at her command.
O say, what bliss can transient Life bestow,
What balm so grateful to the social mind,
As FRIENDSHIP'S voice­where gentle precepts flow
From the blest source of sentiment refin'd?
When FATE'S stern hand shall close my weeping eye,
And seal, at length, my wand'ring spirit's doom;
Oh! may kind FRIENDSHIP catch my parting sigh,
And cheer with HOPE the terrors of the TOMB."
374,Emotion,FriendPoemsHisAgeDedicatedToHisPeculiarFriendMrJohnWickesUnderTheNameOfpostumusPoembyRobertHerrick,"Ah, Posthumus!  our years hence fly
And leave no sound:  nor piety,
Or prayers, or vow
Can keep the wrinkle from the brow;
But we must on,
As fate does lead or draw us; none,
None, Posthumus, could e'er decline
The doom of cruel Proserpine.
The pleasing wife, the house, the ground
Must all be left, no one plant found
To follow thee,
Save only the curst cypress-tree!
--A merry mind
Looks forward, scorns what's left behind;
Let's live, my Wickes, then, while we may,
And here enjoy our holiday.
We've seen the past best times, and these
Will ne'er return; we see the seas,
And moons to wane,
But they fill up their ebbs again;
But vanish'd man,
Like to a lily lost, ne'er can,
Ne'er can repullulate, or bring
His days to see a second spring.
But on we must, and thither tend,
Where Ancus and rich Tullus blend
Their sacred seed;
Thus has infernal Jove decreed;
We must be made,
Ere long a song, ere long a shade.
Why then, since life to us is short,
Let's make it full up by our sport.
Crown we our heads with roses then,
And 'noint with Tyrian balm; for when
We two are dead,
The world with us is buried.
Then live we free
As is the air, and let us be
Our own fair wind, and mark each one
Day with the white and lucky stone.
We are not poor, although we have
No roofs of cedar, nor our brave
Baiae, nor keep
Account of such a flock of sheep;
Nor bullocks fed
To lard the shambles; barbels bred
To kiss our hands; nor do we wish
For Pollio's lampreys in our dish.
If we can meet, and so confer,
Both by a shining salt-cellar,
And have our roof,
Although not arch'd, yet weather-proof,
And cieling free,
From that cheap candle-baudery;
We'll eat our bean with that full mirth
As we were lords of all the earth.
Well, then, on what seas we are tost,
Our comfort is, we can't be lost.
Let the winds drive
Our bark, yet she will keep alive
Amidst the deeps;
'Tis constancy, my Wickes, which keeps
The pinnace up; which, though she errs
I' th' seas, she saves her passengers.
Say, we must part; sweet mercy bless
Us both i' th' sea, camp, wilderness!
Can we so far
Stray, to become less circular
Than we are now?
No, no, that self-same heart, that vow
Which made us one, shall ne'er undo,
Or ravel so, to make us two.
Live in thy peace; as for myself,
When I am bruised on the shelf
Of time, and show
My locks behung with frost and snow;
When with the rheum,
The cough, the pthisic, I consume
Unto an almost nothing; then,
The ages fled, I'll call again,
And with a tear compare these last
Lame and bad times with those are past,
While Baucis by,
My old lean wife, shall kiss it dry;
And so we'll sit
By th' fire, foretelling snow and slit
And weather by our aches, grown
Now old enough to be our own
True calendars, as puss's ear
Wash'd o'er 's, to tell what change is near;
Then to assuage
The gripings of the chine by age,
I'll call my young
Iulus to sing such a song
I made upon my Julia's breast,
And of her blush at such a feast.
Then shall he read that flower of mine
Enclosed within a crystal shrine;
A primrose next;
A piece then of a higher text;
For to beget
In me a more transcendant heat,
Than that insinuating fire
Which crept into each aged sire
When the fair Helen from her eyes
Shot forth her loving sorceries;
At which I'll rear
Mine aged limbs above my chair;
And hearing it,
Flutter and crow, as in a fit
Of fresh concupiscence, and cry,
'No lust there's like to Poetry.'
Thus frantic, crazy man, God wot,
I'll call to mind things half-forgot;
And oft between
Repeat the times that I have seen;
Thus ripe with tears,
And twisting my Iulus' hairs,
Doting, I'll weep and say, 'In truth,
Baucis, these were my sins of youth.'
Then next I'Il cause my hopeful lad,
If a wild apple can be had,
To crown the hearth;
Lar thus conspiring with our mirth;
Then to infuse
Our browner ale into the cruse;
Which, sweetly spiced, we'll first carouse
Unto the Genius of the house.
Then the next health to friends of mine.
Loving the brave Burgundian wine,
High sons of pith,
Whose fortunes I have frolick'd with;
Such as could well
Bear up the magic bough and spell;
And dancing 'bout the mystic Thyrse,
Give up the just applause to verse;
To those, and then again to thee,
We'll drink, my Wickes, until we be
Plump as the cherry,
Though not so fresh, yet full as merry
As the cricket,
The untamed heifer, or the pricket,
Until our tongues shall tell our ears,
We're younger by a score of years.
Thus, till we see the fire less shine
From th' embers than the kitling's eyne,
We'll still sit up,
Sphering about the wassail cup,
To all those times
Which gave me honour for my rhymes;
The coal once spent, we'll then to bed,
Far more than night bewearied."
375,Emotion,FriendPoemsMyBestFriendChildrenPoembyCJHeck,"My best friend had lots of curls
but wasn’t like the other girls
who stayed dressed up and always clean.
My best friend wore old blue jeans.
She loved to do things just like me,
like building forts and climbing trees.
She stubbed her toe, and to stop the blood,
we both walked barefoot through the mud.
She could pitch a baseball, make it fly
much faster than most any guy.
And when she ran, her feet had wings!
My best friend could do anything.
All summer long we stayed outside
pretending things and riding bikes
or sometimes wading in the creek
where I fell down and skinned my knee.
One autumn day, I saw her cry.
I felt so sad when she told me why.
The doctors told her she was sick
and she needed treatment, really quick.
Her parents drove her.  I watched them go,
and doctors still don’t really know
just how to cure the thing she had
that made her sick and feel so bad.
One rainy night she went away
up to heaven where she will stay,
but her memory will never end
‘cause I’ll always remember
my best friend."
376,Emotion,FriendPoemsTheLostFriendPoembyAmyLevy,"The people take the thing of course,
They marvel not to see
This strange, unnatural divorce
Betwixt delight and me.
I know the face of sorrow, and I know
Her voice with all its varied cadences;
Which way she turns and treads; how at her ease
Things fit her dreary largess to bestow.
Where sorrow long abides, some be that grow
To hold her dear, but I am not of these;
Joy is my friend, not sorrow; by strange seas,
In some far land we wandered, long ago.
O faith, long tried, that knows no faltering!
O vanished treasure of her hands and face!--
Beloved--to whose memory I cling,
Unmoved within my heart she holds her place.
And never shall I hail that other ""friend,""
Who yet shall dog my footsteps to the end."

378,Emotion,FriendPoemsWhatTypeOfFriendAreYouPoembyKishaBanks,"SIMPLE VS. REAL
Let me identify...
Simple friends have never seen you cry. Real friends are on standby.
A Best friend make you feel better whenever you talk.
Simple friends hate when you call after a certain time, waking them up is such a crime.  Real friends don't care if it's during dinner or bed time.
A Best friend calls for no reason at all.
Simple friends talk with you about your problems.  Real friends are there until you solve them.
A Best friend mentions you in their daily prayers.
Simple friends speak of self-interest.  Real friends listen to your gab fest, never showing disinterest.
A Best friend never reveals your secrets.
Simple friends are 'ok' with your success.  Real friends are there through the process, making sure you don't digress.
A Best friend forces you to strive and achieve the best each day.
Let me classify...
You as my best friend, a God send."
379,Emotion,FriendPoemsADeadFriendPoembyAlgernonCharlesSwinburne,"I.
Gone, O gentle heart and true,
Friend of hopes foregone,
Hopes and hopeful days with you
Gone?
Days of old that shone
Saw what none shall see anew,
When we gazed thereon.
Soul as clear as sunlit dew,
Why so soon pass on,
Forth from all we loved and knew
Gone?
II.
Friend of many a season fled,
What may sorrow send
Toward thee now from lips that said
'Friend'?
Sighs and songs to blend
Praise with pain uncomforted
Though the praise ascend?
Darkness hides no dearer head:
Why should darkness end
Day so soon, O dear and dead
Friend?
III.
Dear in death, thou hast thy part
Yet in life, to cheer
Hearts that held thy gentle heart
Dear.
Time and chance may sear
Hope with grief, and death may part
Hand from hand's clasp here:
Memory, blind with tears that start,
Sees through every tear
All that made thee, as thou art,
Dear.
IV.
True and tender, single-souled,
What should memory do
Weeping o'er the trust we hold
True?
Known and loved of few,
But of these, though small their fold,
Loved how well were you!
Change, that makes of new things old,
Leaves one old thing new;
Love which promised truth, and told
True.
V.
Kind as heaven, while earth's control
Still had leave to bind
Thee, thy heart was toward man's whole
Kind.
Thee no shadows blind
Now:  the change of hours that roll
Leaves thy sleep behind.
Love, that hears thy death-bell toll
Yet, may call to mind
Scarce a soul as thy sweet soul
Kind.
VI.
How should life, O friend, forget
Death, whose guest art thou?
Faith responds to love's regret,
How?
Still, for us that bow
Sorrowing, still, though life be set,
Shines thy bright mild brow.
Yea, though death and thou be met,
Love may find thee now
Still, albeit we know not yet
How.
VII.
Past as music fades, that shone
While its life might last;
As a song-bird's shadow flown
Past!
Death's reverberate blast
Now for music's lord has blown
Whom thy love held fast.
Dead thy king, and void his throne:
Yet for grief at last
Love makes music of his own
Past."
380,Emotion,FriendPoemsRememberingAFriendPoembyPdishere,"Children are like buds of flowers.
Nourish them with good thoughts,
Feed them on quality education,
And they would turn into a valley if flowers.
Their smile brings spring.
And their tears the monsoon.
They are the hope and future,
If they are allowed to bloom.
Very lucky we were
To have Nehru at the helm,
Who had vision for India
And a pure love for them.
He worked tirelessly
To bring cheer in their lives,
By quality health care
And made education a delight.
No wonder we the children
Remember him years on end
And we know on this Childrens’ Day
Chacha Nehru was our best friend."

382,Emotion,FriendPoemsThinkingOfAFriendAtNightPoembyHermannHesse,"In this evil year, autumn comes early...
I walk by night in the field, alone, the rain clatters,
The wind on my hat...And you? And you, my friend?
You are standing- maybe- and seeing the sickle moon
Move in a small arc over the forests
And bivouac fire, red in the black valley.
You are lying- maybe- in a straw field and sleeping
And dew falls cold on your forehead and battle jacket.
It's possible tonight you're on horseback,
The farthest outpost, peering along, with a gun in your fist,
Smiling, whispering, to your exhausted horse.
Maybe- I keep imagining- you are spending the night
As a guest in a strange castle with a park
And writing a letter by candlelight, and tapping
On the piano keys by the window,
Groping for a sound...
- And maybe
You are already silent, already dead, and the day
Will shine no longer into your beloved
Serious eyes, and your beloved brown hand hangs wilted,
And your white forehead split open- Oh, if only,
If only, just once, that last day, I had shown you, told you
Something of my love, that was too timid to speak!
But you know me, you know...and, smiling, you nod
Tonight in front of your strange castle,
And you nod to your horse in the drenched forest,
And you nod to your sleep to your harsh clutter of straw,
And think about me, and smile.
And maybe,
Maybe some day you will come back from the war,
and take a walk with me some evening,
And somebody will talk about Longwy, Luttich, Dammerkirch,
And smile gravely, and everything will be as before,
And no one will speak a word of his worry,
Of his worry and tenderness by night in the field,
Of his love. And with a single joke
You will frighten away the worry, the war, the uneasy nights,
The summer lightning of shy human friendship,
Into the cool past that will never come back.

a pal on who I can depend.
We are always together,
I love him in a funny sort of way
but I hasten to add, I’m certainly not gay
He always gets all the attention
I’m sure he goes out with that intention.
Females fondle him quite unashamedly,
whilst I observe  with a tinge of envy.
But he is a real good looking guy
a guy that attracts admiring female glances
and oh boy he certainly gets his chances.
Yet from birth when he learned to walk
my best friend has never been able to talk.
He understands everything that I say,
he communicates with me in his own special way.
Tonight we are watching the TV
but I am bored, it’s a re-run on BBC.
I glance at the clock it’s quarter to nine
the weather outside is warm and fine
I say  ‘‘ lets  go to the pub
for a few  glasses of  ale.”
He jumps up makes for the door
wagging his tail.
Need I say more,  my best friend is

Where flit the shadows with their endless cry,
You reach the shore where all the world goes by,
You leave the strife, the slavery, the pain;
But we, but we, the mortals that remain
In vain stretch hands; for Charon sullenly
Drives us afar, we may not come anigh
Till that last mystic obolus we gain.
But you are happy in the quiet place,
And with the learned lovers of old days,
And with your love, you wander ever-more

About the gate, or labour at the oar."

390,Emotion,FriendPoemsINowOFriendWhomNoiselesslyTheSnowsPoembyRobertLouisStevenson,"I NOW, O friend, whom noiselessly the snows
Settle around, and whose small chamber grows
Dusk as the sloping window takes its load:
* * * * *
The kindly hill, as to complete our hap,
Has ta'en us in the shelter of her lap;
Well sheltered in our slender grove of trees
And ring of walls, we sit between her knees;
A disused quarry, paved with rose plots, hung
With clematis, the barren womb whence sprung
The crow-stepped house itself, that now far seen
Stands, like a bather, to the neck in green.
A disused quarry, furnished with a seat
Sacred to pipes and meditation meet
For such a sunny and retired nook.
There in the clear, warm mornings many a book
Has vied with the fair prospect of the hills
That, vale on vale, rough brae on brae, upfills
Halfway to the zenith all the vacant sky
To keep my loose attention. . . .
Horace has sat with me whole mornings through:
And Montaigne gossiped, fairly false and true;
And chattering Pepys, and a few beside
That suit the easy vein, the quiet tide,
The calm and certain stay of garden-life,
Far sunk from all the thunderous roar of strife.
There is about the small secluded place
A garnish of old times; a certain grace
Of pensive memories lays about the braes:
The old chestnuts gossip tales of bygone days.
Here, where some wandering preacher, blest Lazil,
Perhaps, or Peden, on the middle hill
Had made his secret church, in rain or snow,
He cheers the chosen residue from woe.
All night the doors stood open, come who might,
The hounded kebbock mat the mud all night.
Nor are there wanting later tales; of how
Prince Charlie's Highlanders . . .

I have had talents, too.  In life's first hour
God crowned with benefits my childish head.
Flower after flower, I plucked them; flower by flower
Cast them behind me, ruined, withered, dead.
Full many a shining godhead disappeared.
From the bright rank that once adorned her brow
The old child's Olympus
* * * * *
Gone are the fair old dreams, and one by one,
As, one by one, the means to reach them went,
As, one by one, the stars in riot and disgrace,
I squandered what . . .
There shut the door, alas! on many a hope
Too many;
My face is set to the autumnal slope,
Where the loud winds shall . . .
There shut the door, alas! on many a hope,
And yet some hopes remain that shall decide
My rest of years and down the autumnal slope.
* * * * *
Gone are the quiet twilight dreams that I
Loved, as all men have loved them; gone!
I have great dreams, and still they stir my soul on high -
Dreams of the knight's stout heart and tempered will.
Not in Elysian lands they take their way;
Not as of yore across the gay champaign,
Towards some dream city, towered . . .
and my . . .
The path winds forth before me, sweet and plain,
Not now; but though beneath a stone-grey sky
November's russet woodlands toss and wail,
Still the white road goes thro' them, still may I,
Strong in new purpose, God, may still prevail.

I and my like, improvident sailors!

At whose light fall awaking, all my heart
Grew populous with gracious, favoured thought,
And all night long thereafter, hour by hour,
The pageant of dead love before my eyes
Went proudly, and old hopes with downcast head

391,Emotion,FriendPoemsYourCatfishFriendPoembyRichardBrautigan,"If I were to live my life
in catfish forms
in scaffolds of skin and whiskers
at the bottom of a pond
and you were to come by
one evening
when the moon was shining
down into my dark home
and stand there at the edge
of my affection
and think, ""It's beautiful
here by this pond.I wish
somebody loved me,""
I'd love you and be your catfish
friend and drive such lonely
thoughts from your mind
and suddenly you would be
at peace,
and ask yourself, ""I wonder
if there are any catfish
in this pond?It seems like
a perfect place for them."""
392,Emotion,FriendPoemsWhoIsYourBestFriendPoembyJuliusBabarinsa,"Everybody needs friends, we all have friends
Some friends are closer to us than our families
If we happen to fall, there are friends to pick us up
What will our life be without friends?
There are many categories of friendship
There are casual friends, bad friends and good friends
The question here is – who is your best friend?
Friends who can turn your tears into laughter
Is your wife your best friend?
I mean the friend you go to
When you need honest advice
Is your husband your best friend?
I mean the friend who knows you
More than you know yourself
Is your brother or sister your best friend?
I mean the friend who always assists you
To solve difficult personal problems
Is your father or mother your best friend?
I mean the friend you feel safe to keep secrets
Are your in-laws your best friend?
I mean the friend you can tell anything
Is your boss or co-worker your best friend?
I mean the friend who can cover you up at work
Is your son or daughter your best friend?
I mean the friend you use as sounding board
For all your confidential and private thoughts
Is your former classmate your best friend?
I mean the friend who cheers you up on bad days
Whoever may be your best friend, remember that
A friend in need is always a friend indeed"
393,Emotion,FriendPoemsFarewellMyFriendPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"I could easily foretell
You had something to tell
As you dropped a stinking bombshell
Farewell, farewell my friend
With words I spell
It all out in a nutshell
Farewell, farewell my friend
What else can I say?
When you take off today for good
Farewell I say with a broken mood
Farewell there goes my wedding bell
Farewell there goes your innocent smell
Farewell there goes our fun in and out of hotels
Farewell I hope that life treats you well
Farewell in your ventures
Our spent time is my treasure
Your heart must wander to where it belongs
Friend, I only urge you to be strong
With love you can simply do no wrong
I say it with these words tipping off my tongue
Farewell, farewell my friend
I am a great believer
Farewell is not forever
I say not goodbye
I do not wish to sit and cry
Farewell, farewell my friend
What else can I say?
You weren’t meant to stay
I will do nothing to detain
You from flying on that plane
Farewell, farewell my friend
I say with pain
Farewell, farewell my friend
In sunshine or in rain
One day, one day
I know we’ll see again
Farewell, farewell my friend
I cannot stand and pretend
That a part me
With you, would still like to be!"

As they must needs (the sister and the brother),
Then must the love be great 'twixt thee and me,
Because thou lov'st the one, and I the other.
Dowland to thee is dear, whose heavenly touch
Upon the lute doth ravish human sense;
Spenser to me, whose deep conceit is such
As, passing all conceit, needs no defence.
Thou lov'st to hear the sweet melodious sound
That Ph{oe}bus' lute (the queen of music), makes;
And I in deep delight am chiefly drown'd

396,Emotion,FriendPoemsMyFriendMyFriendPoembyAnneSexton,"Who will forgive me for the things I do?
With no special legend of God to refer to,
With my calm white pedigree, my yankee kin,
I think it would be better to be a Jew.
I forgive you for what you did not do.
I am impossibly quilty. Unlike you,
My Friend, I can not blame my origin
With no special legend or God to refer to.
They wear The Crucifix as they are meant to do.
Why do their little crosses trouble you?
The effigies that I have made are genuine,
(I think it would be better to be a Jew).
Watching my mother slowly die I knew
My first release. I wish some ancient bugaboo
Followed me. But my sin is always my sin.
With no special legend or God to refer to.
Who will forgive me for the things I do?
To have your reasonable hurt to belong to
Might ease my trouble like liquor or aspirin.
I think it would be better to be a Jew.
And if I lie, I lie because I love you,
Because I am bothered by the things I do,
Because your hurt invades my calm white skin:
With no special legend or God to refer to,
I think it would be better to be a Jew."
397,Emotion,FriendPoemsMockPanegyricOnAYoungFriendPoembyJaneAusten,"In measured verse I'll now rehearse
The charms of lovely Anna:
And, first, her mind is unconfined
Like any vast savannah.
Ontario's lake may fitly speak
Her fancy's ample bound:
Its circuit may, on strict survey
Five hundred miles be found.
Her wit descends on foes and friends
Like famed Niagara's fall;
And travellers gaze in wild amaze,
And listen, one and all.
Her judgment sound, thick, black, profound,
Like transatlantic groves,
Dispenses aid, and friendly shade
To all that in it roves.
If thus her mind to be defined
America exhausts,
And all that's grand in that great land
In similes it costs --
Oh how can I her person try
To image and portray?
How paint the face, the form how trace,
In which those virtues lay?
Another world must be unfurled,
Another language known,
Ere tongue or sound can publish round
Her charms of flesh and bone."
398,Emotion,FriendPoemsToAFriendWhoseWorkHasComeToNothingPoembyWilliamButlerYeats,"NOW all the truth is out,
Be secret and take defeat
From any brazen throat,
For how can you compete,
Being honour bred, with one
Who, were it proved he lies,
Were neither shamed in his own
Nor in his neighbours' eyes?
Bred to a harder thing
Than Triumph, turn away
And like a laughing string
Whereon mad fingers play
Amid a place of stone,
Be secret and exult,
Because of all things known
That is most difficult."

400,Emotion,RomancePoemsRadioRomancePoembyRyanWegenast,"Radio romance ridicules soul,
soldiers beat is the only motion I know.
The power of pride I will always show,
never shall I hide the glorious glow.
Radio romance advances swiftly,
razor eyes rumble the ground before thee,
trembling knees gain strength and rigidity,
supporting the weight of all that is me.
Radio romance spits fulsome flattery,
sadly believed are these words entrusted through doubt.
Loves lies swipe neat,
about face choked cries.
Radio romance takes a seat, beat"
401,Emotion,RomancePoemsARomancePoembyDaniilIvanovichKharms,"He looks at me with a madman's eyes -
It's your house and porch I know so well.
He gives me a kiss with his crimson lips -
Our ancestors had gone to war in scales of steel.
He brought me a bouquet of crimson carnations -
It's your austere face I know so well.
He asked in return for a single kiss -
Our ancestors had gone to war in scales of steel.
He touched me with his finger bearing a dark ring -
It is your dark ring I know so well.
Together we tumbled down on a Turkish divan -
Our ancestors had gone to war in scales of steel.
He looks at me with a madman's eyes -
Dwindle away, o you stars, and fade, o you moon!
He gives me a kiss with his crimson lips -
Our ancestors had gone to war in scales of steel."
402,Emotion,RomancePoemsRomanceIsDead17509PoembyScottDaniels,"Romance is dead
It fell to the ground
With a bullet in its head
It was a cold blooded killer
That pulled the trigger
While the children played
In the park, on the swings
Poor Romance went down
Without a sound, Without a fight
It didn't stand a chance
Noone came to the funeral
It was shown up for what it was
Big Businesses Marionette
which lay beneath the soil
Along with Romeo and Juliet
It never lived happily every after
In careless abandonment
It chose instead
To die beside Heathcliff
On a dampened bed

403,Emotion,RomancePoemsTheAutumnalRomancePoembyInnokentyFedorovichAnnensky,"1903
I watch you as coldly as never,
But can’t keep this pine in my breast,
Today sun’s in smoke of havens,
And sadness makes heavy a breath.
I know, I breed just a fable –
At least, trust to fables, - but you?…
Like needless oblations, in alleys,
Leaves fall in the mournful hue.
We’re joined by the fate that was blinded:
Would God join us ‘there’ – behind sky?…
Don’t laugh, if in spring days, delighted,
You’ll step on the lives that here die."

405,Emotion,RomancePoemsKamikazeRomancePoembyTMA,"It’s a kamikaze romance
With our hearts strapped in the seats
And we wage a war called Love
And we’ll not concede defeat
Even if it means flying
In the face of certain doom
We both know the end is coming,
And the end is coming soon…
It’s a kamikaze romance
How sweet the flight, though, while it lasts
Hurtling through the air
Watching heart-shaped clouds zooming past…
Let’s try, love, not to think
Of how this must come to an end
We know it will not last forever
But at least we can pretend…
It’s a kamikaze romance
And when our course starts turning downwards
All the memories of what we had
Will forever be ours
When comes the end; with tears,
With a scream, and with a screech,
Perhaps they’ll find pieces of our broken hearts
Strewn across some glassy beach…"

to Bloom
let me wait
and watch out
When the Spring Rains;
it is
now in the sky
lustly curved
with stunning colours
just a minute
it whispers
a new tune of lies
and glues to heart
pining to see
the invisible sight
The embers
of Romance
lightens up
when the moist hearts
warmly rain
looks of Spring
full of perfumed wings
to suckle the nectar
to open up
the pot of potion
mesmerizing ocean
bodies vanish
leaving imprints
we see the lovers
kissing empty airs
seeing life images
like Rainbows
still printed
in transparent airs"
407,Emotion,RomancePoemsTheRomanceOfPatrolmanCaseyPoembyEllisParkerButler,"There was a young patrolman who
Had large but tender feet;
They always hurt him badly when
He walked upon his beat.
(He always took them with him when
He walked upon his beat.)
His name was Patrick Casey and
A sweetheart fair had he;
Her face was full of freckles—but
Her name was Kate McGee.
(It was in spite of freckles that
Her name was Kate McGee.)
'Oh, Pat!' she said, 'I’ll wed you when
Promotion comes to you!'
'I’m much-obliged,' he answered, and
'I’ll see what I can do.'
(I may remark he said it thus—
'Oi’ll say phwat Oi kin do.')
So then he bought some new shoes which
Allowed his feet more ease—
They may have been large twelves. Perhaps
Eighteens, or twenty-threes.
(That’s rather large for shoes, I think—
Eighteens or twenty-threes!)
What last they were I don’t know, but
Somehow it seems to me
I’ve heard somewhere they either were
A, B, C, D, or E.
(More likely they were five lasts wide—
A, B plus C, D, E.)
They were the stoutest cowhide that
Could be peeled off a cow.
But he was not promoted
So
Kate wed him anyhow.
(This world is crowded full of Kates
That wed them anyhow.)"
408,Emotion,RomancePoemsUnshackledThoughtsOnChivalryRomanceAdventureEtcPoembyFranklinPierceAdams,"Yesterday afternoon, while I was walking on Worth Street,
A gust of wind blew my hat off.
I swore, petulantly, but somewhat noisily.
A young woman had been near, walking behind me;
She must have heard me, I thought.
And I was ashamed, and embarrassedly sorry.
So I said to her: ""If you heard me, I beg your pardon.""
But she gave me a frightened look
And ran across the street,
Seeking a policeman.
So I thought, Why waste five hours trying to versify the incident?
Verse libre would serve her right."

410,Emotion,RomancePoemsRomancePoembyRobertLouisStevenson,"I WILL make you brooches and toys for your delight
Of bird-song at morning and star-shine at night.
I will make a palace fit for you and me,
Of green days in forests and blue days at sea.
I will make my kitchen, and you shall keep your room,
Where white flows the river and bright blows the broom,
And you shall wash your linen and keep your body white
In rainfall at morning and dewfall at night.
And this shall be for music when no one else is near,
The fine song for singing, the rare song to hear!
That only I remember, that only you admire,
Of the broad road that stretches and the roadside fire."
411,Emotion,RomancePoemsSheWillGetMyRomancePoembyMeaganPeters,"I'm hopelessly in love, every much a part of you.
I'm hopeless in love, very much apart from you.
I had your heart clenched in my hand,
I let it slip like gritty, shifty grains of sand.
I let your heart get torn apart
Comforted by another's arms.
Drifting in another's charms
while I lay lonely, torn apart.
Our endless love was beauty, a dream to be extant.
Now my fault alas folly; it's altering to extinct.
I always lived on hope,
never gave up on a chance.
Your words the stamp of denouement...
'she will get my romance'"

This life is just a cruel game
this world, is a shame
conflicting stories, lovers torn apart
without the change of a new start
I was getting into the way of evil might
I lost everything that night
without your sudden appearance I'd have died
but your beautiful wings took me into the height
These arms around me with loving care
what else could I loose if we'd dare
beautifully entwining bodies, bare
anything I have, I want to share
Hot kisses on cold skin
let's commit the sweetest sin
feel the impact of loving
take away my grieving
Never thought it would find such an end
the one you called friend
to bring me death he was send
without you being there to defend

I still feel my longing for you growing
but will you now ever be knowing
that I'm waiting for you under the stars, the glowing"

414,Emotion,RomancePoemsRomancePartTwoHourglassPoembyAprilAvalon,"The pages of the years
Are crying of the same;
Each word - each silent sound reminds of you,
I'm counting days
By just extracting from dimension 'love'
Dimension 'pain'.
And I'll forget you, love
Just when a blind man draws
One sound on the non-existing wall,
One of a rose
That's falling quietly on the castle's floor,
No longer whole.
Through all the darkest nights
I'll have your worst nightmares,
I'll be your one eternal candle's light,
I'm always there -
We breathe the same and so much filled with love
October air.
And when the ages die,
The broken hourglass -
The symbol of the battle 'Love and Time'-
Will speak of us.
The world, no longer knowing what is love,
Will speak of us."
415,Emotion,RomancePoemsTheRomanceOfBritomartePoembyAdamLindsayGordon,"I'LL tell you a story ; but pass the 'jack',
And let us make merry to-night, my men.
Aye, those were the days when my beard was black—
I like to remember them now and then—
Then Miles was living, and Cuthbert there,
On his lip was never a sign of down ;
But I carry about some braided hair,
That has not yet changed from the glossy brown
That it show'd the day when I broke the heart
Of that bravest of destriers, 'Britomarte.'
Sir Hugh was slain (may his soul find grace !)
In the fray that was neither lost nor won
At Edgehill—then to St. Hubert's Chase
Lord Goring despatch'd a garrison—
But men and horses were ill to spare,
And ere long the soldiers were shifted fast.
As for me, I never was quartered there
Till Marston Moor had been lost ; at last,
As luck would have it, alone, and late
In the night, I rode to the northern gate.
I thought, as I pass'd through the moonlit park,
On the boyish days I used to spend
In the halls of the knight lying stiff and stark—
Thought on his lady, my father's friend
(Mine, too, in spite of my sinister bar,
But with that my story has naught to do)—
She died the winter before the war—
Died giving birth to the baby Hugh.
He pass'd ere the green leaves clothed the bough,
And the orphan girl was the heiress now.
When I was a rude and a reckless boy,
And she a brave and a beautiful child,
I was her page, her playmate, her toy—
I have crown'd her hair with the field-flowers wild
Cowslip and crowfoot and colt's-foot bright—
I have carried her miles when the woods were wet,
I have read her romances of dame and knight ;
She was my princess, my pride, my pet.
There was then this proverb us twain between,
For the glory of God and of Gwendoline.
She had grown to a maiden wonderful fair,
But for years I had scarcely seen her face.
Now, with troopers Holdsworth, Huntly, and Clare,
Old Miles kept guard at St. Hubert's Chase,
And the chatelaine was a Mistress Ruth,
Sir Hugh's half-sister, an ancient dame,
But a mettlesome soul had she forsooth,
As she show'd when the time of her trial came.
I bore despatches to Miles and to her
To warn them against the bands of Kerr.
And mine would have been a perilous ride
With the rebel horsemen—we knew not where
They were scattered over that country side,—
If it had not been for my brave brown mare.
She was iron-sinew'd and satin-skinn'd,
Ribb'd like a drum and limb'd like a deer,
Fierce as the fire and fleet as the wind—
There was nothing she couldn't climb or clear—
Rich lords had vex'd me, in vain, to part
For their gold and silver, with Britomarte.
Next morn we muster'd scarce half a score
With the serving men, who were poorly arm'd
Five soldiers, counting myself, no more,
And a culverin, which might well have harm'd
Us, had we used it, but not our foes,
When, with horses and foot, to our doors they came,
And a psalm-singer summon'd us (through his nose),
And deliver'd—'This, in the people's name,
Unto whoso holdeth this fortress here,
Surrender ! or bide the siege—John Kerr.'
'Twas a mansion built in a style too new,
A castle by courtesy, he lied
Who called it a fortress—yet, 'tis true,
It had been indifferently fortified—
We were well provided with bolt and bar—
And while I hurried to place our men,
Old Miles was call'd to a council of war
With Mistress Ruth and with her, and when
They had argued loudly and long, those three,
They sent, as a last resource, for me.
In the chair of state sat erect Dame Ruth ;
She had cast aside her embroidery ;
She had been a beauty, they say, in her youth,
There was much fierce fire in her bold black eye.
'Am I deceived in you both ?' quoth she.
'If one spark of her father's spirit lives
In this girl here—so, this Leigh, Ralph Leigh,
Let us hear what counsel the springald gives.'
Then I stammer'd, somewhat taken aback—
(Simon, you ale-swiller, pass the 'jack').
The dame wax'd hotter—'Speak out, lad, say,
Must we fall in that canting caitiff's power ?
Shall we yield to a knave and a turncoat ? Nay,
I had liever leap from our topmost tower.
For a while we can surely await relief ;
Our walls are high and our doors are strong.'
This Kerr was indeed a canting thief—
I know not rightly, some private wrong
He had done Sir Hugh, but I know this much,
Traitor or turncoat he suffer'd as such.
Quoth Miles—'Enough ! your will shall be done ;
Relief may arrive by the merest chance,
But your house ere dusk will be lost and won ;
They have got three pieces of ordnance.'
Then I cried, 'Lord Guy, with four troops of horse,
Even now is biding at Westbrooke town ;
If a rider could break through the rebel force
He would bring relief ere the sun goes down
Through the postern door could I make one dart
I could baffle them all upon Britomarte.'
Miles mutter'd 'Madness !' Dame Ruth look'd grave,
Said, 'True, though we cannot keep one hour
The courtyard, no, nor the stables save,
They will have to batter piecemeal the tower,
And thus——' But suddenly she halted there.
With a shining hand on my shoulder laid,
Stood Gwendoline.  She had left her chair,
And, 'Nay, if it needs must be done,' she said,
'Ralph Leigh will gladly do it, I ween,
For the glory of God and of Gwendoline.'
I had undertaken a heavier task
For a lighter word.  I saddled with care,
Nor cumber'd myself with corselet nor casque
(Being loth to burden the brave brown mare).
Young Clare kept watch on the wall—he cried,
'Now, haste, Ralph ! this is the time to seize ;
The rebels are round us on every side,
But here they straggle by twos and threes.'
Then out I led her, and up I sprung,
And the postern door on its hinges swung.
I had drawn this sword—you may draw it and feel,
For this is the blade that I bore that day—
There's a notch even now on the long grey steel,
A nick that has never been rasp'd away.
I bow'd my head and I buried my spurs,
One bound brought the gliding green beneath ;
I could tell by her back-flung, flatten'd ears
She had fairly taken the bit in her teeth—
(What, Jack, have you drain'd your namesake dry,
Left nothing to quench the thirst of a fly ?)
These things are done, and are done with, lad,
In far less time than your talker tells;
The sward with their hoof-strokes shook like mad,
And rang with their carbines and petronels ;
And they shouted, 'Cross him and cut him off,'
'Surround him,' 'Seize him,' 'Capture the clown,
Or kill him,' 'Shall he escape to scoff
In your faces ?' 'Shoot him or cut him down.'
And their bullets whistled on every side :
Many were near us and more were wide.
Not a bullet told upon Britomarte ;
Suddenly snorting, she launched along ;
So the osprey dives where the seagulls dart,
So the falcon swoops where the kestrels throng ;
And full in my front one pistol flash'd,
And right in my path their sergeant got.
How are jack-boots jarr'd, how are stirrups clash'd,
While the mare like a meteor past him shot ;
But I clove his skull with a backstroke clean,
For the glory of God and of Gwendoline.
And as one whom the fierce wind storms in the face
With spikes of hail and with splinters of rain,
I, while we fled through St. Hubert's Chase,
Bent till my cheek was amongst her mane.
To the north full a league of the deer-park lay,
Smooth, springy turf, and she fairly flew,
And the sound of their hoof-strokes died away,
And their far shots faint in the distance grew.
Loudly I laughed, having won the start,
At the folly of following Britomarte.
They had posted a guard at the northern gate—
Some dozen of pikemen and musketeers.
To the tall park palings I turn'd her straight ;
She veer'd in her flight as the swallow veers.
And some blew matches and some drew swords,
And one of them wildly hurl'd his pike,
But she clear'd by inches the oaken boards,
And she carried me yards beyond the dyke ;
Then gaily over the long green down
We gallop'd, heading for Westbrooke town.
The green down slopes to the great grey moor,
The grey moor sinks to the gleaming Skelt—
Sudden and sullen, and swift and sure,
The whirling water was round my belt.
She breasted the bank with a savage snort,
And a backward glance of her bloodshot eye,
And 'Our Lady of Andover's' flash'd like thought,
And flitted St. Agatha's nunnery,
And the firs at The Ferngrove fled on the right,
And 'Falconer's Tower' on the left took flight.
And over 'The Ravenswold' we raced—
We rounded the hill by 'The Hermit's Well'—
We burst on the Westbrooke Bridge—'What haste ?
What errand ?' shouted the sentinel.
'To Beelzebub with the Brewer's knave !'
'Carolus Rex and he of the Rhine !'
Galloping past him, I got and gave
In the gallop password and countersign,
All soak'd with water and soil'd with mud,
With the sleeve of my jerkin half drench'd in blood.
Now, Heaven be praised that I found him there—
Lord Guy.  He said, having heard my tale,
'Leigh, let my own man look to your mare,
Rest and recruit with our wine and ale ;
But first must our surgeon attend to you ;
You are somewhat shrewdly stricken, no doubt.'
Then he snatched a horn from the wall and blew,
Making 'Boot and Saddle' ring sharply out.
'Have I done good service this day ?' quoth I.
'Then I will ride back in your troop, Lord Guy.'
In the street I heard how the trumpets peal'd,
And I caught the gleam of a morion
From the window—then to the door I reel'd ;
I had lost more blood than I reckon'd upon ;
He eyed me calmly with keen grey eyes—
Stern grey eyes of a steel-blue grey—
Said, 'The wilful man can never be wise,
Nathless the wilful must have his way,'
And he pour'd from a flagon some fiery wine ;
I drain'd it, and straightway strength was mine.
.   .   .   .   .   .   .
I was with them all the way on the brown—
'Guy to the rescue !'  'God and the king !'
We were just in time, for the doors were down ;
And didn't our sword-blades rasp and ring,
And didn't we hew and didn't we hack ?
The sport scarce lasted minutes ten—
(Aye, those were the days when my beard was black ;
I like to remember them now and then).
Though they fought like fiends, we were four to one,
And we captured those that refused to run.
We have not forgotten it, Cuthbert, boy !
That supper scene when the lamps were lit ;
How the women (some of them) sobb'd for joy ;
How the soldiers drank the deeper for it;
How the dame did honours, and Gwendoline,
How grandly she glided into the hall,
How she stoop'd with the grace of a girlish queen,
And kiss'd me gravely before them all ;
And the stern Lord Guy, how gaily he laugh'd,
Till more of his cup was spilt than quaff'd.
Brown Britomarte lay dead in her straw
Next morn—we buried her—brave old girl !
John Kerr, we tried him by martial law,
And we twisted some hemp for the trait'rous churl ;
And she—I met her alone—said she,
'You have risk'd your life, you have lost your mare,
And what can I give in return, Ralph Leigh ?'
I replied, 'One braid of that bright brown hair.'
And with that she bow'd her beautiful head,
'You can take as much as you choose,' she said.
And I took it—it may be, more than enough—
And I shore it rudely, close to the roots.
The wine or wounds may have made me rough,
And men at the bottom are merely brutes.
Three weeks I slept at St. Hubert's Chase ;
When I woke from the fever of wounds and wine
I could scarce believe that the ghastly face
That the glass reflected was really mine.
I sought the hall—where a wedding had been—
The wedding of Guy and of Gwendoline.
The romance of a grizzled old trooper's life
May make you laugh in your sleeves : laugh out,
Lads ; we have most of us seen some strife ;
We have all of us had some sport, no doubt.
I have won some honour and gain'd some gold,
Now that our king returns to his own ;
If the pulses beat slow, if the blood runs cold,
And if friends have faded and loves have flown,
Then the greater reason is ours to drink,
And the more we swallow the less we shall think.
At the battle of Naseby, Miles was slain,
And Huntly sank from his wounds that week ;
We left young Clare upon Worcester plain—
How the 'Ironside' gash'd his girlish cheek.
Aye, strut, and swagger, and ruffle anew,
Gay gallants, now that the war is done !
They fought like fiends (give the fiend his due)—
We fought like fops, it was thus they won.
Holdsworth is living for aught I know,
At least he was living two years ago,
And Guy—Lord Guy—so stately and stern,
He is changed, I met him at Winchester ;
He has grown quite gloomy and taciturn.
Gwendoline !—why do you ask for her ?
Died ! as her mother had died before—
Died giving birth to the baby Guy !
Did my voice shake ? Then am I fool the more.
Sooner or later we all must die ;
But, at least, let us live while we live to-night.
The days may be dark, but the lamps are bright.
For to me the sunlight seems worn and wan :
The sun, he is losing his splendour now—
He can never shine as of old he shone
On her glorious hair and glittering brow.
Ah ! those days that were, when my beard was black,
Now I have only the nights that are.
What, landlord, ho ! bring in haste burnt sack,
And a flask of your fiercest usquebaugh.
You, Cuthbert ! surely you know by heart
The story of her and of Britomarte."

She was only ever ‘that girl’,
The one who always awoke instantly from the sound of:
An angry door slamming,
A single tear hitting the cold floor,
And a razor blade being dismantled from its safe covering.
But when she was with him-
With his arms of steal padlocked around her,
Not even the sound of his heartbeat awoke her,
Instead it soothed and rocked her to sleep,
Their two fragmented hearts beating so close,
But they never got a chance to beat to
Beat as one.

It appears that this girl is in love, I think this is too wonderful for some With his arms of steal padlocked around her,
Not even the sound of his heartbeat awoke her,
Instead it soothed and rocked her to sleep -, asked me to think of the poetry of Rabindranath Tagore - Rabindranath Tagore poetry that is a distant man to propose to a girl, but girl hiding in a Window closed behind, not the views of this man, but that men no longer appear in the girl's side, this girl very much miss the man, usually sitting on the window edge, once again look forward to the arrival of men on TV drama,
If this poem of the man who can no longer see the girl now, this girl will find themselves has been the biggest loss of life,
Poetry in my opinion this girl is not because of money and other external factors have my love, is one of the world heavy on sweet things to comfort the people of the beauty,
My irony in a story on some woman in this world willing to speak with the Devil would not treasure marriage,
Indeed, the true feelings and the feelings of real importance, as well as women and men through the feelings of the true, spiritual love combined are the foundation of the world,
Did not put the spirit of the people linked to the feelings of life linked to magma, such as water and fish together, this world is the terrible cold Forever hell

It seems that this girl rectifies above first love, my feel like this one paragraph of What a match With his arms of steal padlocked around her, Not even the sound of his heartbeat awoke her, Instead it soothed and rocked her to sleep- - - - -, let me remember that poetry and song of Rabindranath Tagore's poetry and song- - Rabindranath Tagore is that the girl makes a proposal to one during the past a distance male person, this girl takes shelter from but behind the window being closing, reluctant idea this male person, That male person will have no the turn up time by this girl anymore but, this girl misses that male person very much, often sit by the window, be expecting that male person's once again arrival, Suppose male person in this poem will no longer appear by the girl, this girl maximal loss that can discover self having met with life, That I think that girl in this poetry and song is not love because of money and my other external factor comes into being, is beautiful conciliative heavy sweet in the world popular feeling object, My money and jewels which can not speak satirizing this some in the world women in being ready to follow a devil in a story gets married, Reliable, true affection and face to face true affection take seriously, the woman and the man pass real sentiments, the spirit feels attached to union each other and, basis being this world, People is not contacted together spirit affection magma is in life connection together, water and fish are in an image this world is forever chill terrifying hell together,
----------
Evidently, this girl is occupying in the first love, I thought this section of too splendid With his arms of steal padlocked around her, Not even the sound of his heartbeat awoke her, Instead it soothed and rocked her to sleep-, is called me to remember Tagore's poetry-Tagore's that poetry is a distant place man comes to a girl to propose, but this girl hides in is closing behind the window, is not willing to see this man, but that man has not appeared again in time this girl's side, this girl thinks of that man, sits frequently nearby the window, is anticipating that man's arrival once more, If in this poem's man does not appear again side the girl, this girl will discover that she has encountered the life biggest loss, I think in this poetry the girl is not because the money and my other external factors produce love, is in the world the serious happy comfort will of the people beautiful thing, I satirize in this world in a story some women to be willing the valuables and money marriage which will speak with the devil, Truly, the real sentiment and takes seriously the real sentiment, as well as the woman and the man through the real sentiment, the spirit loves one another the union, is this world foundation, The people have not contacted with in the together energetic sentiment the rock magma the life relates in together, looks like Shui Heyu in the same place, this world is forever the cold fearful hell,

看 样 子 ， 这 个 姑 娘 正 处 在 初 恋 中 ， 我 觉 得 这 一 段 太 精 彩 了 With his arms of steal padlocked around her,
Not even the sound of his heartbeat awoke her,
Instead it soothed and rocked her to sleep-， 叫 我 想 起 泰 戈 尔 的 诗 歌 -泰 戈 尔 的 那 诗 歌 是 一 个 远 方 的 男 子 来 向 一 姑 娘 求 婚 ， 但 这 姑 娘 躲 在 关 着 的 窗 子 后 面 ， 不 愿 意 见 这 男 子 ， 但 是 那 男 子 再 也 没 有 出 现 在 这 姑 娘 的 身 边 时 ， 这 姑 娘 非 常 想 念 那 男 子 ， 常 常 坐 在 窗 子 边 ， 期 待 着 那 男 子 的 再 次 到 来 ，

Emollient lubricant of heart

The loving beats in the life

With amiable fragrance of jasmine
Which furl one over and over
To flame poignant in its fire
It takes one to a lofty locus
And levitate to those blinking stars
And it twines both together
As chords of life to sing together
But beware of its resilient style
Which hustle you to mundane desert
To reap the barren insensible mind

418,Emotion,RomancePoemsAnHourOfRomancePoembyFeliciaDorotheaHemans,"There were thick leaves above me and around,
And low sweet sighs like those of childhood's sleep,
Amidst their dimness, and a fitful sound
As of soft showers on water; dark and deep
Lay the oak shadows o'er the turf, so still
They seem'd but pictured glooms: a hidden rill
Made music, such as haunts us in a dream,
Under the fern-tufts; and a tender gleam
Of soft green light, as by the glow-worm shed,
Came pouring thro' the woven beech-boughs down,
And steep'd the magic page wherein I read
Of royal chivalry and old renown,
A tale of Palestine. Meanwhile the bee
Swept past me with a tone of summer hours,
A drowsy bugle, wafting thoughts of flowers,
Blue skies, and amber sunshine: brightly free,
On filmy wings the purple dragon-fly
Shot glancing like a fairy javelin by;
And a sweet voice of sorrow told the dell
Where sat the lone wood-pigeon:
But ere long,
All sense of these things faded, as the spell
Breathing from that high gorgeous tale grew strong
On my chain'd soul: 'twas not the leaves I heard
A Syrian wind the Lion-banner stirr'd,
Thro' its proud, floating folds: 'twas not the brook,
Singing in secret thro' its grassy glen;
A wild shrill trumpet of the Saracen
Peal'd from the desert's lonely heart, and shook
The burning air. Like clouds when winds are high,
O'er glittering sands flew steeds of Araby,
And tents rose up, and sudden lance and spear
Flash'd where a fountain's diamond wave lay clear,
Shadow'd by graceful palm-trees. Then the shout
Of merry England's joy swell'd freely out,
Sent thro' an eastern heaven, whose glorious hue
Made shields dark mirrors to its depths of blue:
And harps were there; I heard their sounding strings,
As the waste echoed to the mirth of kings.
The bright masque faded. Unto life's worn track,
What call'd me from its flood of glory, back?
A voice of happy childhood! and they pass'd,
Banner, and harp, and Paynim's trumpet's blast;
Yet might I scarce bewail the splendours gone,
My heart so leap'd to that sweet laughter's tone."
419,Emotion,RomancePoemsTheKeyAMoorishRomancePoembyThomasHood,"'On the east coast, towards Tunis, the Moors still preserve the key of their ancestors' houses in Spain; to which country they still express the hopes of one day returning and again planting the crescent on the ancient walls of the Alhambra.'
—Scott's
Travels in Morocco and Algiers.
'Is Spain cloven in such a manner as to want closing?'
Sancho Panza in
Don Quixote
The Moor leans on his cushion,
With the pipe between his lips;
And still at frequent intervals
The sweet sherbét he sips;
But, spite of lulling vapor
And the sober cooling cup,
The spirit of the swarthy Moor
Is fiercely kindling up!
One hand is on his pistol,
On its ornamented stock,
While his finger feels the trigger
And is busy with the lock—
The other seeks his ataghan,
And clasps its jewell'd hilt—
Oh! much of gore in days of yore
That crooked blade has spilt!
His brows are knit, his eyes of jet
In vivid blackness roll,
And gleam with fatal flashes
Like the fire-damp of the coal;
His jaws are set, and through his teeth
He draws a savage breath,
As if about to raise the shout
Of Victory or Death!
For why? the last Zebeck that came
And moor'd within the Mole,
Such tidings unto Tunis brought
As stir his very soul—
The cruel jar of civil war,
The sad and stormy reign,
That blackens like a thunder cloud
The sunny land of Spain!
No strife of glorious Chivalry,
For honor's gain or loss,
Nor yet that ancient rivalry,
The Crescent with the Cross.
No charge of gallant Paladins
On Moslems stern and stanch;
But Christians shedding Christian blood
Beneath the olive's branch!
A war of horrid parricide,
And brother killing brother;
Yea, like to 'dogs and sons of dogs'
That worry one another.
But let them bite and tear and fight,
The more the Kaffers slay,
The sooner Hagar's swarming sons
Shall make the land a prey!
The sooner shall the Moor behold
Th' Alhambra's pile again;
And those who pined in Barbary
Shall shout for joy in Spain—
The sooner shall the Crescent wave
On dear Granada's walls:
And proud Mohammed Ali sit
Within his fathers halls!
'Alla-il-alla!' tiger-like
Up springs the swarthy Moor,
And, with a wide and hasty stride,
Steps o'er the marble floor;
Across the hall, till from the wall,
Where such quaint patterns be,
With eager hand he snatches down
And old and massive Key!
A massive Key of curious shape,
And dark with dirt and rust,
And well three weary centuries
The metal might encrust!
For since the King Boabdil fell
Before the native stock,
That ancient Key, so quaint to see,
Hath never been in lock.
Brought over by the Saracens
Who fled accross the main,
A token of the secret hope
Of going back again;
From race to race, from hand to hand,
From house to house it pass'd;
O will it ever, ever ope
The Palace gate at last?
Three hundred years and fifty-two
On post and wall it hung—
Three hundred years and fifty-two
A dream to old and young;
But now a brighter destiny
The Prophet's will accords:
The time is come to scour the rust,
And lubricate the wards.
For should the Moor with sword and lance
At Algesiras land,
Where is the bold Bernardo now
Their progress to withstand?
To Burgos should the Moslem come,
Where is the noble Cid
Five royal crowns to topple down
As gallant Diaz did?
Hath Xeres any Pounder now,
When other weapons fail,
With club to thrash invaders rash,
Like barley with a flail?
Hath Seville any Perez still,
To lay his clusters low,
And ride with seven turbans green
Around his saddle-bow?
No! never more shall Europe see
Such Heroes brave and bold,
Such Valor, Faith and Loyalty,
As used to shine of old!
No longer to one battle cry
United Spaniards run,
And with their thronging spears uphold
The Virgin and her Son!
From Cadiz Bay to rough Biscay
Internal discord dwells,
And Barcelona bears the scars
Of Spanish shot and shells.
The fleets decline, the merchants pine
For want of foreign trade;
And gold is scant; and Alicante
Is seal'd by strict blockade!
The loyal fly, and Valor falls,
Opposed by court intrigue;
But treachery and traitors thrive,
Upheld by foreign league;
While factions seeking private ends
By turns usurping reign—
Well may the dreaming, scheming Moor
Exulting point to Spain!
Well may he cleanse the rusty Key
With Afric sand and oil,
And hope an Andalusian home
Shall recompense the toil!
Well may he swear the Moorish spear
Through wild Castile shall sweep,
And where the Catalonian sowed
The Saracen shall reap!
Well may he vow to spurn the Cross
Beneath the Arab hoof,
And plant the Crescent yet again
Above th' Alhambra's roof—
When those from whom St. Jago's name
In chorus once arose,
Are shouting Faction's battle-cries,
And Spain forgets to 'Close!'
Well may he swear his ataghan
Shall rout the traitor swarm,
And carve them into Arabesques
That show no human form—
The blame be theirs, whose bloody feuds
Invite the savage Moor,
And tempt him with the ancient Key
To seek the ancient door!"

Seared into my wounded heart,
And she’ll weep at the shattered remnants
Of my lonely poetry.

Our call and counter-cry,
I shall not find Thee quick and kind,
Nor know Thee till I die,
Enough for me in dreams to see
And touch Thy garments' hem:
Thy feet have trod so near to God
I may not follow them.
Through wantonness if men profess
They weary of Thy parts,
E'en let them die at blasphemy
And perish with their arts;
But we that love, but we that prove
Thine excellence august,
While we adore discover more
Thee perfect, wise, and just.
Since spoken word Man's Spirit stirred
Beyond his belly-need,
What is is Thine of fair design
In thought and craft and deed;
Each stroke aright of toil and fight,
That was and that shall be,
And hope too high, wherefore we die,
Has birth and worth in Thee.
Who holds by Thee hath Heaven in fee
To gild his dross thereby,
And knowledge sure that he endure
A child until he die --
For to make plain that man's disdain
Is but new Beauty's birth --
For to possess in loneliness
The joy of all the earth.
As Thou didst teach all lovers speech
And Life all mystery,
So shalt Thou rule by every school
Till love and longing die,
Who wast or yet the Lights were set,
A whisper in the Void,
Who shalt be sung through planets young
When this is clean destroyed.
Beyond the bounds our staring rounds,
Across the pressing dark,
The children wise of outer skies
Look hitherward and mark
A light that shifts, a glare that drifts,
Rekindling thus and thus,
Not all forlorn, for Thou hast borne
Strange tales to them of us.
Time hath no tide but must abide
The servant of Thy will;
Tide hath no time, for to Thy rhyme
The ranging stars stand still --
Regent of spheres that lock our fears,
Our hopes invisible,
Oh 'twas certes at Thy decrees
We fashioned Heaven and Hell!
Pure Wisdom hath no certain path
That lacks thy morning-eyne,
And captains bold by Thee controlled
Most like to Gods design;
Thou art the Voice to kingly boys
To lift them through the fight,
And Comfortress of Unsuccess,
To give the dead good-night --
A veil to draw 'twixt God His Law
And Man's infirmity,
A shadow kind to dumb and blind
The shambles where we die;
A rule to trick th' arithmetic
Too base of leaguing odds --
The spur of trust, the curb of lust,
Thou handmaid of the Gods!
O Charity, all patiently
Abiding wrack and scaith!
O Faith, that meets ten thousand cheats
Yet drops no jot of faith!
Devil and brute Thou dost transmute
To higher, lordlier show,
Who art in sooth that lovely Truth
The careless angels know!
Thy face is far from this our war,
Our call and counter-cry,
I may not find Thee quick and kind,
Nor know Thee till I die.
Yet may I look with heart unshook
On blow brought home or missed --
Yet may I hear with equal ear
The clarions down the List;
Yet set my lance above mischance
And ride the barriere --
Oh, hit or miss, how little 'tis,
My Lady is not there!"

427,Emotion,RomancePoemsFamilyRomancePoembyLarryLevis,"Sister once of weeds & a dark water that held still
In ditches reflecting the odd,
Abstaining clouds that passed, & kept
Their own counsel, we
Were different, we kept our own counsel.
Outside the tool shed in the noon heat, while our father
Ground some piece of metal
That would finally fit, with grease & an hour of pushing,
The needs of the mysterious Ford tractor,
We argued out, in adolescence,
Whole systems of mathematics, ethics,
And finally agreed that altruism,
Whose long vowel sounded like the pigeons,
Roosting stupidly & about to be shot
In the barn, was impossible
If one was born a Catholic. The Swedish
Lutherans, whom the nuns called
“Statue smashers,” the Japanese on
Neighboring farms, were, we guessed,
A little better off ....
When I was twelve, I used to stare at weeds
Along the road, at the way they kept trembling
Long after a car had passed;
Or at gnats in families hovering over
Some rotting peaches, & wonder why it was
I had been born a human.
Why not a weed, or a gnat?
Why not a horse, or a spider? And why an American?
I did not think that anything could choose me
To be a Larry Levis before there even was
A Larry Levis. It was strange, but not strange enough
To warrant some design.
On the outside,
The barn, with flaking paint, was still off-white.
Inside, it was always dark, all the way up
To the rafters where the pigeons moaned,
I later thought, as if in sexual complaint,
Or sexual abandon; I never found out which.
When I walked in with a 12-gauge & started shooting,
They fell, like gray fruit, at my feet—
Fat, thumping things that grew quieter
When their eyelids, a softer gray, closed,
Part of the way, at least,
And their friends or lovers flew out a kind of skylight
Cut for loading hay.
I don’t know, exactly, what happened then.
Except my sister moved to Switzerland.
My brother got a job
With Colgate-Palmolive.
He was selling soap in Lodi, California.
Later, in his car, & dressed
To die, or live again, forever,
I drove to my own, first wedding.
I smelled the stale boutonniere in my lapel,
A deceased young flower.
I wondered how my brother’s Buick
Could go so fast, &,
Still questioning, or catching, a last time,
An old chill from childhood,
I thought: why me, why her, & knew it wouldn’t last."

The Captain? filled with ale?
He moored his expected boat to a stake in the water
And stumbled on sea-legs into the Hall for mating,
Only to be seduced by her lady-in-waiting,
Round-bosomed, and not so pale.
Or the thrifty burgher in boots and fancy vest
With considered views of marriage?
By the tidy scullery maid he was impressed
Who kept that house from depreciation and dirt,
But wife does double duty and takes no hurt,
So he rode her home in his carriage.

They let him wait in the crypt of the Old Library
And found him compromised with a Saxon book,
Claiming his truelove Learning kept that nook
And promised sweet disport.
Desirée (of a mother’s christening) never shall wed
Though fairest child of her womb;
“We will have revenge,” her injured Ladyship said,
“Henceforth the tightest nunnery be thy bed
By the topmost stair! When the ill-bred lovers come
We’ll say, She is not at home.”"

431,Emotion,RomancePoemsRomancePoembyWilliamErnestHenley,"'Talk of pluck!' pursued the Sailor,
Set at euchre on his elbow,
'I was on the wharf at Charleston,
Just ashore from off the runner.
'It was grey and dirty weather,
And I heard a drum go rolling,
Rub-a-dubbing in the distance,
Awful dour-like and defiant.
'In and out among the cotton,
Mud, and chains, and stores, and anchors,
Tramped a squad of battered scarecrows -
Poor old Dixie's bottom dollar!
'Some had shoes, but all had rifles,
Them that wasn't bald was beardless,
And the drum was rolling Dixie,
And they stepped to it like men, sir!
'Rags and tatters, belts and bayonets,
On they swung, the drum a-rolling,
Mum and sour. It looked like fighting,
And they meant it too, by thunder!'"
432,Emotion,RomancePoemsALittleRomanceInMyLifePoembyKeithWilliams,"I cannot explain the way I feel about you
Girl, you're always on my mind
Everytime I often think of you
I get a funny feeling that
I'm so in love with you
I want to give you all my love
Let me show you that I'm real
The love that I have shall never fade away
I'm tired of being broken hearted
I need a little romance in my life
Can't you see I need little romance?
Take my hand
May I have this dance
No one can love the way that I can love
I'm telling you
I need a chance
I need a little romance in my life"
433,Emotion,RomancePoemsARomanceIsLifePoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"How does one make the life so romantic?
No problem even if your friends are living beyond Atlantic
There is no distance barrier and one sees directly
It is enough to rouse feelings if we speak honestly
Even seasons inject the feeling of romance
The individual may find appealing with little glance
It may certainly give relief when first shower is on
Everything sounds dramatic when heat waves have gone
It takes away your concentration when beautiful eyes are met
What a magnetic pull effect when wishes are responded or let
It was beautifully hidden in one side of the beating heart
You are in no position to think or respond despite looking so smart
Beautiful and attractive faces play all the tricks
The magic environment persists without use of sticks
How does one fall in magnetic pull of attraction?
How does the individual respond with any reaction?
One good smile takes away his beautiful smile
He doesn’t know how to carry on for a while
There is strong urge to come very close
They may try to prove good and try not to loose
To go in for quick seduction may not work any longer
They may need some to help them as messenger
The bold action may follow suit if both are sincere
Romantic words are exchanged without any fear
The romance has got no age bar
They can come closer while driving in car
Each one finds a feeling of super star when they meet
The whole world seems to have fallen or come under their feet"

436,Emotion,RomancePoemsEndymionAPoeticRomanceExcerptPoembyJohnKeats,"BOOK I
A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:
Its loveliness increases; it will never
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.
Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing
A flowery band to bind us to the earth,
Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth
Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,
Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways
Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall
From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,
Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon
For simple sheep; and such are daffodils
With the green world they live in; and clear rills
That for themselves a cooling covert make
'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,
Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:
And such too is the grandeur of the dooms
We have imagined for the mighty dead;
All lovely tales that we have heard or read:
An endless fountain of immortal drink,
Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.
Nor do we merely feel these essences
For one short hour; no, even as the trees
That whisper round a temple become soon
Dear as the temple's self, so does the moon,
The passion poesy, glories infinite,
Haunt us till they become a cheering light
Unto our souls, and bound to us so fast,
That, whether there be shine, or gloom o'ercast;
They always must be with us, or we die.
Therefore, 'tis with full happiness that I
Will trace the story of Endymion.
The very music of the name has gone
Into my being, and each pleasant scene
Is growing fresh before me as the green
Of our own valleys: so I will begin
Now while I cannot hear the city's din;
Now while the early budders are just new,
And run in mazes of the youngest hue
About old forests; while the willow trails
Its delicate amber; and the dairy pails
Bring home increase of milk. And, as the year
Grows lush in juicy stalks, I'll smoothly steer
My little boat, for many quiet hours,
With streams that deepen freshly into bowers.
Many and many a verse I hope to write,
Before the daisies, vermeil rimm'd and white,
Hide in deep herbage; and ere yet the bees
Hum about globes of clover and sweet peas,
I must be near the middle of my story.
O may no wintry season, bare and hoary,
See it half finish'd: but let Autumn bold,
With universal tinge of sober gold,
Be all about me when I make an end.
And now, at once adventuresome, I send
My herald thought into a wilderness:
There let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress
My uncertain path with green, that I may speed
Easily onward, thorough flowers and weed...."
437,Emotion,RomancePoemsRomancePoembyChristopherJohnBrennan,"Of old, on her terrace at evening
...not here...in some long-gone kingdom
O, folded close to her breast!...
--our gaze dwelt wide on the blackness
(was it trees? or a shadowy passion
the pain of an old-world longing
that it sobb'd, that it swell'd, that it shrank?)
--the gloom of the forest
blurr'd soft on the skirt of the night-skies
that shut in our lonely world.
...not here...in some long-gone world...
close-lock'd in that passionate arm-clasp
no word did we utter, we stirr'd not:
the silence of Death, or of Love...
only, round and over us
that tearless infinite yearning
and the Night with her spread wings rustling
folding us with the stars.
...not here...in some long-gone kingdom
of old, on her terrace at evening
O, folded close to her heart!..."

No Romance sold unto
Could so enthrall a Man
As the perusal of
His Individual One—
'Tis Fiction's—When 'tis small enough
To Credit—'Tisn't true!"
439,Emotion,RomancePoemsRomancePoembyArthurRimbaud,"When you are seventeen you aren't really serious.
- One fine evening, you've had enough of beer and lemonade,
And the rowdy cafes with their dazzling lights!
- You go walking beneath the green lime trees of the promenade.
The lime trees smell good on fine evenings in June!
The air is so soft sometimes, you close your eyelids;
The wind, full of sounds, - the town's not far away -
Carries odours of vines, and odours of beer...
II
- Then you see a very tiny rag
Of dark blue, framed by a small branch,
Pierced by an unlucky star which is melting away
With soft little shivers, small, perfectly white...
June night! Seventeen! - You let yourself get drunk.
The sap is champagne and goes straight to your head...
You are wandering; you feel a kiss on your lips
Which quivers there like something small and alive...
III
Your mad heart goes Crusoeing through all the romances,
- When, under the light of a pale street lamp,
Passes a young girl with charming little airs,
In the shadow of her father's terrifying stiff collar...
And because you strike her as absurdly naif,
As she trots along in her little ankle boots,
She turns, wide awake, with a brisk movement...
And then cavatinas die on your lips...
IV
You're in love. Taken until the month of August.
You're in love - Your sonnets make Her laugh.
All your friends disappear, you are not quite the thing.
- Then your adored one, one evening, condescends to write to you...!
That evening,... - you go back again to the dazzling cafes,
You ask for beer or for lemonade...
- You are not really serious when you are seventeen
And there are green lime trees on the promenade...

On n'est pas sérieux, quand on a dix-sept ans.
- Un beau soir, foin des bocks et de la limonade,
Des cafés tapageurs aux lustres éclatants !
- On va sous les tilleuls verts de la promenade.
Les tilleuls sentent bon dans les bons soirs de juin !
L'air est parfois si doux, qu'on ferme la paupière ;
Le vent chargé de bruits - la ville n'est pas loin -
A des parfums de vigne et des parfums de bière....
II
-Voilà qu'on aperçoit un tout petit chiffon
D'azur sombre, encadré d'une petite branche,
Piqué d'une mauvaise étoile, qui se fond
Avec de doux frissons, petite et toute blanche...
Nuit de juin ! Dix-sept ans ! - On se laisse griser.
La sève est du champagne et vous monte à la tête...
On divague ; on se sent aux lèvres un baiser
Qui palpite là, comme une petite bête....
III
Le coeur fou Robinsonne à travers les romans,
Lorsque, dans la clarté d'un pâle réverbère,
Passe une demoiselle aux petits airs charmants,
Sous l'ombre du faux col effrayant de son père...
Et, comme elle vous trouve immensément naïf,
Tout en faisant trotter ses petites bottines,
Elle se tourne, alerte et d'un mouvement vif....
- Sur vos lèvres alors meurent les cavatines...
IV
Vous êtes amoureux. Loué jusqu'au mois d'août.
Vous êtes amoureux. - Vos sonnets La font rire.
Tous vos amis s'en vont, vous êtes mauvais goût.
- Puis l'adorée, un soir, a daigné vous écrire...!
- Ce soir-là,... - vous rentrez aux cafés éclatants,
Vous demandez des bocks ou de la limonade..
- On n'est pas sérieux, quand on a dix-sept ans
Et qu'on a des tilleuls verts sur la promenade."

441,Emotion,RomancePoemsMyChemicalRomancePoembyLeeDegnan,"I wanted to tell you
how it is that I love you
it used to be so easy
I'd pick up a pen
and let the words flow in
choosing the right ones so freely
But then I'd let someone
talk me into destruction
of all thinking and feeling
Just once a day this pill
which, at times, makes me ill
supresses... well, pretty much anything
Now it seems like every day
feels strangely the same in every way
like lifeless circles of day and night
They treat me for depression
by drugging my brain into submission
yet somehow, I'm not a zombie... right?
Forgive me for my senseless rambling
trying to keep my brain from scrambling
A battle I very much seem to be losing
There was something I had to tell you
but what that was, I have no clue...
Hmmm... I think I need a nap."
442,Emotion,RomancePoemsLetRomanceBeRomanceFromTheSongstersLyricsPoembyPeterSQuinn,"Let romance be romance
Every dark night be morning
And love our 2nd chance
In love's ever turning
From its doubling dear
Giving so much and close
Just by heaving you here
Like sweet morning rose
Every day is to be fine
Coming in for a kiss
When there's rising sunshine
With everything there is
Love falling younger
Into everything sung
Every day so much longer
In the summer's tongue
Rising and energizing
In new dreams of creation
Imaginations beauty stylizing
With romancing gradation
Love songs to do and give
Feeling of desiring long
This around now to live
In anew found around song"
443,Emotion,RomancePoemsFriendshipWithRomancePoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"So you want a piece of my
Rosy, cushy, juicy pie
I’m afraid, without romance on supply
This refined lady is not going to comply
Before into my world
You make your entrance
Remember this lady loves romance
So how about friendship with romance
Maybe you may stand a chance
Send me sweet roses once in a while
Make it your number one style
I need you now, not as a lover
If that is your immediate aim
You’ll be sucked out of my life with a hover
So how about friendship with romance
Now and then, take me out to dance
Hypnotise me, enchant me in a trance
With words and your exquisite rainbow smile
Don’t just tell me, ‘you fancy me’
I’ll buzz these words to you like a bee
Go take a hike by the sea
Till you roast and dry
So you want a taste of my
Rosy, cushy, juicy delicious pie
I’m afraid, without romance on supply
This refined lady is not going to comply
You have no money! That’s no excuse
There are so many different ways to amuse
I love romance
I eat romance
I sleep romance
Send me little sweet notes
Put them in a bottle
Out in the sea to float
I love romance with a passion
Mesmerise me with some imagination
Don’t try pushy or bushy
There is simply no chance without romance
Of the sweet taste
Of my rosy, cushy, juicy delicious pie

444,Emotion,RomancePoemsRomancePoembyJuandelEncina,"Yo me estava reposando,
durmiendo como solía.
Recordé, triste, llorando
con gran pena que sentía.
Levantéme muy sin tiento
de la cama en que dormía,
cercado de pensamiento,
que valer no me podía.
Mi passión era tan fuerte
que de mí yo no sabía.
Conmigo estava la Muerte
por tenerme compañía.
Lo que más me fatigava
no era porque muría,
mas era porque dexava
de servir a quien servía.
Servía yo una señora
que más que a mí la quería,
y ella fue la causadora
de mi mal sin mejoría.
La media noche passada,
ya que era cerca el día,
salíme de mi posada
por ver si descansaría.
Fui para donde morava
aquella que más quería,
por quien yo triste penava,
mas ella no parecía.
Andando todo turbado
con las ansias que tenía,
vi venir a mi Cuidado
dando bozes, y dezía:
«Si dormís, linda señora,
recordad por cortesía,
pues que fuestes causadora
de la desventura mía.
Remediad mi gran tristura,
satisfazed mi porfía,
porque si falta ventura
del todo me perdería.»
Y con mis ojos llorosos,
un triste llanto hazía
con sospiros congoxosos,
y nadie lo parecía.
En estas cuitas estando,
como vi que esclarecía,
a mi casa sospirando
me bolví sin alegría."
445,Emotion,RomancePoemsRomanceOfABureaucratPoembyRatnakarMandlik,"Change is life, though he loves status quo
Unwilling perhaps yet he accepts to bow
Before the authority's command for change
Coward in him fails to face powers' challange.
Inaction n indecision are inherent qualities
Practiced by bureaucrat by grace of almighty.
In romance he indulges with schemes n reforms
Loyalty n sincerity, never he follows such norms.
Romance of bureaucrat blurs any vision
That incorporates plans n their implementation.
Mismanagement n misconception are the basics
That train n teach him treachrous tricks.
He romances too with guv policy's formulation
As also its' circulation n  on it ample discussion.

446,Emotion,RomancePoemsFullOfRomancePoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"Life is full of enterprise and romance
It must be tested and understood at once
We are here to prove our worth and excel
Rest all may follow suit and go well
He has thought over it and assigned the role
Take it as challenge and respond to call
You may find thousands of different creatures
You got to decide where your future lies
Prove on return that you did whatever you could
You did not merely spent life for searching the food
Even thought life was proving hell and difficult
You should love to live without fear of any insult
If you determined to overcome all the hurdles
There won’t be any impact even if they come in bundles
It is part of life and must be faced as they come
Seattle it accordingly and always try to welcome
It can’t come to standstill with one or two failures
It strengthens your efforts to make it sure
The end path is chosen and pushed through
This is only truth and equally true
We must thank almighty for giving us an opportunity
Even though it is a belief and we can only think of infinity
It is afforded once only and if is lost in vain
There will be nothing left except pain"
447,Emotion,RomancePoemsRomanceBoreSeductionPoembyMarkRSlaughter,"Hand blessed hand, caressed.
A blushing rose, her face;
Her breast alive;
The elfin nose, a diamond set -
A kiss upon perfection
Bore a rise of pulse
To coach a sultry moan
Across a mellow breath of wine.
He knew; he sensed,
And easing loose a clasp of lace,
Another sign of her relenting:
Wild the play of eyes,
A fuller glide of skin;
He felt the now begin -
Her swell, intention in the sigh.
And so to hedge his move upon the cue -
The cry of deep anticipation,
Waxing all he saw -
Tho' not for us to view -
Arrived, emotion raw.

It hurts to be sober tonight.
The mirror reflects such a hideous expression
That I promptly turn off the light.
Some porno, then casual sex with my hand...
Oh damn! This is something I shouldn't have said.
Why don't you believe that I need no boyfriend -
No problems, no worries, no tears, no regret?
Romance is dead,
And so am I,
I can't forget
My perfect lie.
I still recall
The times we had.
Oh well, that's all.
Romance is dead.
I can't fall asleep, so I get on the net,
Where I claim to be an online super-wh-,
I find guys like you just to make them all fret,
My tease makes them want me, but they can't get more
Than flirt for some minutes, some sexual tension
And then disconnect. Their muse disappears.
I've had a good time with these cruel intentions -
Enough for today. See you later, my dear.
Romance is dead,
And so am I,
I can't forget
My perfect lie.

Breath circles skyward bound
Days fall short, shadowed by the night
Nature climbing into hibernation
Trees standing bare, flowers wilt away
A world still beautiful to the eye
Yet emptied of all its colour
Still my heart it does rejoice
Warmed by another’s kind grace
A muse of such beauty to the soul
Playing out this winter romance
Early evening the moon stands proud
Casting its light through windows
The streets line solitary in shadows
There is not a care but for love
But for love there is not a care
All the beauty of a romantic thought
Is shared amongst friends
A winter romance begins
The beauty of the season"

And held you tight,

I doubt I'll know,
What I did wrong,
So now I'm gone,
And don't answer my phone.
You searched for me,
To bring me back,
But now know,
I couldn't come back,
You made your choice,
And lived a lie,
So why did you go and die?
You searched for love,
And knew you'd never find,
A love as good as mine."

Too shy to say 'hi' she was still suffering
From teenage gawkiness and feared
He would not return her greeting
This handsome young man who
Walked around with an air of true
Self-confidence made her even more
Diffident about even exchanging a smile
Then suddenly to her astonishment
He just turned around and smiled
Then plucking a rose he offered it to her
After that there was no turning back
A new romance was born............"
452,Emotion,RomancePoemsRomanceInTheMarketPlacePoembyRodericQuinn,"YOU stood beside the flowers,
Yourself a flower;
And on your face
The twilight stayed another hour,
It shone so pale;
And all around men talked as in a market-place.
I heard them talk, and felt
No interest stir
In what they said.
Lilies were nigh you, and around you were
The lights of love,
And all about the world moved on with nervous tread.
I heard it not; for down
And round about
My soul you drew
The veils that shut the loud earth out,
And I and you
Were there alone — no one beside but I and you!
What words were those we said?
Old ones, perchance,
Pale with the pain
Of all who've kissed, and talked romance,
And said farewell,
And mixed their tears and kissed, and sighed — and sighed in vain.
We stood a sainted while,
And then your hand
Sought to be free,
And you were gone; and all the land
Was under gloom,
And lamps were lit for other men, but none for me.
I stood and watched you go,
And suddenly
The loud world grew
Like some great-voiced, insetting sea;
And men went by,
Talking of trade and war and all but love and you."

Auspicious Queen of childish joys,
Who lead'st along, in airy dance,
Thy votive train of girls and boys;
At length, in spells no longer bound,
I break the fetters of my youth;
No more I tread thy mystic round,
But leave thy realms for those of Truth.
And yet 'tis hard to quit the dreams
Which haunt the unsuspicious soul,
Where every nymph a goddess seems,
Whose eyes through rays immortal roll;
While Fancy holds her boundless reign,
And all assume a varied hue;
When Virgins seem no longer vain,
And even Woman's smiles are true.
And must we own thee, but a name,
And from thy hall of clouds descend?
Nor find a Sylph in every dame,
A Pylades in every friend?
But leave, at once, thy realms of air i
To mingling bands of fairy elves;
Confess that woman's false as fair,
And friends have feeling for---themselves?
With shame, I own, I've felt thy sway;
Repentant, now thy reign is o'er;
No more thy precepts I obey,
No more on fancied pinions soar;
Fond fool! to love a sparkling eye,
And think that eye to truth was dear;
To trust a passing wanton's sigh,
And melt beneath a wanton's tear!
Romance! disgusted with deceit,
Far from thy motley court I fly,
Where Affectation holds her seat,
And sickly Sensibility;
Whose silly tears can never flow
For any pangs excepting thine;
Who turns aside from real woe,
To steep in dew thy gaudy shrine.
Now join with sable Sympathy,
With cypress crown'd, array'd in weeds,
Who heaves with thee her simple sigh,
Whose breast for every bosom bleeds;
And call thy sylvan female choir,
To mourn a Swain for ever gone,
Who once could glow with equal fire,
But bends not now before thy throne.
Ye genial Nymphs, whose ready tears
On all occasions swiftly flow;
Whose bosoms heave with fancied fears,
With fancied flames and phrenzy glow
Say, will you mourn my absent name,
Apostate from your gentle train
An infant Bard, at least, may claim
From you a sympathetic strain.
Adieu, fond race! a long adieu!
The hour of fate is hovering nigh;
E'en now the gulf appears in view,
Where unlamented you must lie:
Oblivion's blackening lake is seen,
Convuls'd by gales you cannot weather,
Where you, and eke your gentle queen,
Alas! must perish altogether."

you hear a funny story,
and sometimes you wonder
if what is written there

Normally you will not question,
in case it embarrasses or offends.
Well I what I am about to tell you
is it a fib or is it true?
Some thirty-eight years ago,
I went to a funeral of a friend
and ended up with the widow
as a booby prize.
So if I told you that
is exactly how I met my wife,
would you believe me
or would you think I am having you on?
You would be wrong
to think I was having you on.
Because it was at her first husband’s funeral that we met.
It was a few weeks later
a bunch of his friend met, in a coffee bar.
Someone suggested
one of us should take the widow out,
and I drew the short straw
and I got the booby prize
all those years ago,
or was it a fine romance.
I will leave it up to you to decide.

457,Emotion,RomancePoemsARomanceInTheRoughPoembyArthurPatchettMartin,"A sturdy fellow, with a sunburnt face,
And thews and sinews of a giant mould;
A genial mind, that harboured nothing base,—
A pocket void of gold.
The rival’s years were fifty at the least—
Withered his skin, and wrinkled as a crone;
But day by day his worldly goods increased,
Till great his wealth had grown.
And she, the lady of this simple tale,
Was tall and straight, and beautiful to view;
Even a poet’s burning words would fail
To paint her roseate hue.
The suitors came, the old one and the young,
Each with fond words her fancy to allure.
For which of them should marriage bells be rung,
The rich one or the poor?
She liked the young one with his winning ways,
He seemed designed to be her future mate—
Besides, in novels and romantic plays
Love has a youthful gait.
But well she knew that poverty was hard,
And humble household cares not meant for her;
Nor cared she what the sentimental bard
Might warble or infer.
She made her choice, the wedding bells rang clear;
The aged bridegroom figured in the Times.
The young man, after some superfluous beer,
Went forth to foreign climes.
And this is all I ever chanced to know,
Told by my mate while digging on the Creek,
Who ended with his handsome face aglow,
And with a verse in Greek."
458,Emotion,RomancePoemsPostOfficeRomancePoembyRobertWilliamService,"The lady at the corner wicket
Sold me a stamp, I stooped to lick it,
And on the envelope to stick it;
A spinster lacking girlish grace,
Yet sweetly sensitive, her face
Seemed to en-star that stodgy place.
Said I: ""I've come from o'er the sea
To ask you if you'll marry me -
That is to say, if you are free.
I see your gentle features freeze;
'I do not like such jokes as these,'
You seem to say . . . Have patience, please.
I saw you twenty years ago;
Just here you sold me stamps, and Oh
Your image seemed to haunt me so.
For you were lovely as a rose,
But I was poor, and I suppose
At me you tilted dainty nose.
Ah, well I knew love could not be,
So sought my fortune o'er the sea,
Deeming that you were lost to me.
Of sailing ships a mate was I,
From oriental ports to ply . . .
Ten years went past of foreign sky.
But always in the starry night
I steered my course with you in sight,
My dream of you a beacon light.
Then after a decade had sped
I cam again: 'What luck? I said,
'Will she be here and free to wed?'
Oh it was on a morn of Spring,
And I had in my purse a ring
I bought in Eastern voyaging,
With thought of you and only you;
For I to my love dream was true . . .
And here you were, your eyes of blue.
The same sun shining on your brow
Lustered you hair as it does now,
My heart was standing still, I vow.
I bought a stamp, my eyes were bent
Upon a ring you wore - I went
Away as if indifferent.
Again I sailed behind the mast,
And yet your image held me fast,
For once again ten years have passed.
And I am bronzed with braid of gold;
The rank of Captain now I hold,
And fifty are my years all told.
Yet still I have that ruby ring
I bought for you that morn of Spring -
See, here it is, a pretty thing. . . .
But now you've none upon your finger;
Why? I don't know - but as I linger
I'm thinking : Oh what can I bring her.
Who all my life have ploughed the ocean,
A lonely man with one devotion -
Just you? Ah, if you'd take the notion
To try the thing you ought to wear,
It fits so well. Do leave it there.
And here's a note addressed to you.
Ah yes, quite strangers are we two,
But - well, please answer soon . . . Adieu!
*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *
Oh no, you never more will see
Her selling stamps at Wicket Three:
Queen of my home, she's pouring tea."
459,Emotion,RomancePoemsRomanceModernePoembyWilliamCarlosWilliams,"Tracks of rain and light linger in
the spongy greens of a nature whose
flickering mountain--bulging nearer,
ebbing back into the sun
hollowing itself away to hold a lake,--
or brown stream rising and falling at the roadside, turning about,
churning itself white, drawing
green in over it,--plunging glassy funnels
fall--
And--the other world--
the windshield a blunt barrier:
Talk to me. Sh! they would hear us.
--the backs of their heads facing us--
The stream continues its motion of
a hound running over rough ground.
Trees vanish--reappear--vanish:
detached dance of gnomes--as a talk
dodging remarks, glows and fades.
--The unseen power of words--
And now that a few of the moves
are clear the first desire is
to fling oneself out at the side into
the other dance, to other music.
Peer Gynt. Rip Van Winkle. Diana.
If I were young I would try a new alignment--
alight nimbly from the car, Good-bye!--
Childhood companions linked two and two
criss-cross: four, three, two, one.
Back into self, tentacles withdrawn.
Feel about in warm self-flesh.
Since childhood, since childhood!
Childhood is a toad in the garden, a
happy toad. All toads are happy
and belong in gardens. A toad to Diana!
Lean forward. Punch the steerman
behind the ear. Twirl the wheel!
Over the edge! Screams! Crash!
The end. I sit above my head--
a little removed--or
a thin wash of rain on the roadway
--I am never afraid when he is driving,--
interposes new direction,
rides us sidewise, unforseen
into the ditch! All threads cut!
Death! Black. The end. The very end--
I would sit separate weighing a
small red handful: the dirt of these parts,
sliding mists sheeting the alders
against the touch of fingers creeping
to mine. All stuff of the blind emotions.
But--stirred, the eye seizes
for the first time--The eye awake!--
anything, a dirt bank with green stars
of scrawny weed flattened upon it under
a weight of air--For the first time!--
or a yawning depth: Big!
Swim around in it, through it--
all directions and find
vitreous seawater stuff--
God how I love you!--or, as I say,
a plunge into the ditch. The End. I sit
examining my red handful. Balancing
--this--in and out--agh.
Love you? It's
a fire in the blood, willy-nilly!
It's the sun coming up in the morning.
Ha, but it's the grey moon too, already up
in the morning. You are slow.
Men are not friends where it concerns
a woman? Fighters. Playfellows.
White round thighs! Youth! Sighs--!
It's the fillip of novelty. It's--
Mountains. Elephants humping along
against the sky--indifferent to
light withdrawing its tattered shreds,
worn out with embraces. It's
the fillip of novelty. It's a fire in the blood.
Oh get a flannel shirt, white flannel
or pongee. You'd look so well!
I married you because I liked your nose.
I wanted you! I wanted you
in spite of all they'd say--
Rain and light, mountain and rain,
rain and river. Will you love me always?
--A car overturned and two crushed bodies
under it.--Always! Always!
And the white moon already up.
White. Clean. All the colors.
A good head, backed by the eye--awake!
backed by the emotions--blind--
River and mountain, light and rain--or
rain, rock, light, trees--divided:
rain-light counter rocks-trees or
trees counter rain-light-rocks or--
Myriads of counter processions
crossing and recrossing, regaining
the advantage, buying here, selling there
--You are sold cheap everywhere in town!--
lingering, touching fingers, withdrawing
gathering forces into blares, hummocks,
peaks and rivers--rivers meeting rock
--I wish that you were lying there dead
and I sitting here beside you.--
It's the grey moon--over and over.
It's the clay of these parts."
460,Emotion,RomancePoemsButterfliesFlowersRomancePoembyNoelHorlanda,"Multicolored monarch fly,
Flower to flower vie,
Tipples nectar,
While I play guitar
Flowers everyday,
For a buxom young lady,
You and I ready,
For a lusty romance
Kisses cheek to cheek,
The dame and I at the peak,
To pick on, pick
Yellow red daisies n’ garden
Flowers I seek,
Roses and candle stick,
Athirst to smooch and flick,
For sweet red lips
Flowers n’ tears, monarch departs,
You and I aren’t apart,
For true love had start,
Promises not to part"
461,Emotion,RomancePoemsLovesApparitionAndEvanishmentAnAllegoricRomancePoembySamuelTaylorColeridge,"Like a lone Arab, old and blind,
Some caravan had left behind,
Who sits beside a ruin'd well,
Where the shy sand-asps bask and swell;
And now he hangs his ag{'e}d head aslant,
And listens for a human sound--in vain!
And now the aid, which Heaven alone can grant,
Upturns his eyeless face from Heaven to gain;--
Even thus, in vacant mood, one sultry hour,
Resting my eye upon a drooping plant,
With brow low-bent, within my garden-bower,
I sate upon the couch of camomile;
And--whether 'twas a transient sleep, perchance,
Flitted across the idle brain, the while
I watch'd the sickly calm with aimless scope,
In my own heart; or that, indeed a trance,
Turn'd my eye inward--thee, O genial Hope,
Love's elder sister! thee did I behold
Drest as a bridesmaid, but all pale and cold,
With roseless cheek, all pale and cold and dim,
Lie lifeless at my feet!
And then came Love, a sylph in bridal trim,
And stood beside my seat;
She bent, and kiss'd her sister's lips,
As she was wont to do;--
Alas! 'twas but a chilling breath
Woke just enough of life in death
To make Hope die anew."
462,Emotion,RomancePoemsfindingLoveInRomancePoembyChristophersDead,"She said that one day she might come back
But this is how it's been for years
I walk on tight ropes and stay too close to the glass
And I hide from my greatest fears
Well I'm done, with holding one
I'm hanging up, the will is gone
Tomorrow brings, a new religion
Yeah you can say I'm taking this one for me
I took a day out to remember
Just the way it felt, the sun and the air
I rode for hours following the train tracks
Until the sky said, yeah it's time to leave
And there I felt, a sudden bolt
Of static life, and electric soul
Today I feel, I can carry on
Love and life came back to sing their song
Can you remember the way it felt
Can't you feel the fire burning
Yes can't you reveal to me how this
Never-ending love could have failed
Well here's to you ‘cause I'm moving on
I lay out sprawled upon the sand
And I know that this is who I want to be
I hear the waves crashing onto the shore
This life-long renewal has new meaning"

464,Emotion,RomancePoemsWatersOfRomancePoembyJoyceHemsley,"A letter to his love:
Meet me tonight by the water of dreams
In the moonlight ~ this is my plea.
Your charms fuel my longing for romance
Oh how I cling to the beauty of thee.
In love I shall be for eternity
So treasure this heaven and patient be
Often my eyes are moist with tears
As I sift through old pictures and souvenirs.
Let us walk and talk by the water's edge
On the sands down at Cascade Bay.
In the calm of night our hearts may unite
And over the sea we could sail away.
Our love would then be a beautiful song
Caresses adding to passion's fire.
Pure as the morning waters that flow
And as pleasant as lingering desire.
Promise you'll be there ~ to start anew.
I'll hold you close in the old-fashioned way.
By rivers and streams, as moonlight beams
We will add to the memories of yesterday."
465,Emotion,RomancePoemsRomancePoembyAndrewLang,"MY Love dwelt in a Northern land.
A gray tower in a forest green
Was hers, and far on either hand
The long wash of the waves was seen,
And leagues on leagues of yellow sand,
The woven forest boughs between!
And through the silver Northern night
The sunset slowly died away,
And herds of strange deer, lily-white,
Stole forth among the branches gray;
About the coming of the light,
They fled like ghosts before the day!
I know not if the forest green
Still girdles round that castle gray;
I know not if the boughs between
The white deer vanish ere the day;
Above my Love the grass is green,
My heart is colder than the clay!"
466,Emotion,RomancePoemsRomancePoembyEdgarAllanPoe,"Romance, who loves to nod and sing,
With drowsy head and folded wing,
Among the green leaves as they shake
Far down within some shadowy lake,
To me a painted paroquet
Hath been- a most familiar bird-
Taught me my alphabet to say-
To lisp my very earliest word
While in the wild wood I did lie,
A child- with a most knowing eye.
Of late, eternal Condor years
So shake the very Heaven on high
With tumult as they thunder by,
I have no time for idle cares
Through gazing on the unquiet sky.
And when an hour with calmer wings
Its down upon my spirit flings-
That little time with lyre and rhyme
To while away- forbidden things!
My heart would feel to be a crime
Unless it trembled with the strings."
467,Emotion,RomancePoemsRomancePoembyClaudeMcKay,"To clasp you now and feel your head close-pressed,
Scented and warm against my beating breast;
To whisper soft and quivering your name,
And drink the passion burning in your frame;
To lie at full length, taut, with cheek to cheek,
And tease your mouth with kisses till you speak
Love words, mad words, dream words, sweet senseless words,
Melodious like notes of mating birds;
To hear you ask if I shall love always,
And myself answer: Till the end of days;
To feel your easeful sigh of happiness
When on your trembling lips I murmur: Yes;
It is so sweet. We know it is not true.
What matters it? The night must shed her dew.
We know it is not true, but it is sweet --
The poem with this music is complete."
468,Emotion,RomancePoemsRomanceWithDemocracy2PoembyRatnakarMandlik,"The era of romance, its beginning.
Dice used by the players was startling
In the game of numbers on chess board
To tilt the power house and it's record.
Hottest commodity than gem or platinum
Turncoats were costliest in the millenium.
A keep of treachery had become wisdom
Criminalization of politics was in blossum.
Ethics, morality became out of fashion,
New tricks were evolved by imagination.
Merit and efficiency were then displaced.
Money and muscle power to them replaced.
No one can fool all for all the times,
Players had forgotten this truth supreme.

An expanse so wide
For us to see
Then you and me
Our reflection in autumn tones
Bemoans
Belies
The placid waters hidden lies
The first chill of an errant breeze
I looked to the side rather than say please
As the sculpted flakes saunter down
Rest arrogantly on the parting geese's crown
The lumbering crane takes to air I behold
Portend the pervasive cold
Easy an slow practiced rise
Should have been no surprise
There was the swoon the croon
The fetching of a moon
The freezing lake holds my feet
Gingerly tread the storm an sleet
I Shudder I fear.
How shall I steer
My innocence naught in natures way
Or to have you sway
The lake is empty, staid.
Like the uselessness of my golden braid
We stand mute frozen in time
Until the inevitable rhyme
Weather the icy romance
To waltz and dance
I and the lake submit to natures will
To seek in time the thaw the thrill

472,Emotion,RomancePoemsRomanceOfDunoisPoembySirWalterScott,"It was Dunois, the young and brave, was bound for Palestine,
But first he made his orisons before Saint Mary's shrine:
'And grant, immortal Queen of Heaven,' was still the Soldierâ€™s prayer;
'That I may prove the bravest knight, and love the fairest fair.'
His oath of honour on the shrine he graved it with his sword,
And followed to the Holy Land the banner of his Lord;
Where, faithful to his noble vow, his war-cry filled the air,
'Be honoured aye the bravest knight, beloved the fairest fair.'
They owed the conquest to his arm, and then his Liegeâ€“Lord said,
'The heart that has for honour beat by bliss must be repaid.-â€”
My daughter Isabel and thou shall be a wedded pair,
For thou art bravest of the brave, she fairest of the fair.'
And then they bound the holy knot before Saint Mary's shrine,
That makes a paradise on earth, if hearts and hands combine;
And every lord and lady bright that were in chapel there
Cried, 'Honoured be the bravest knight, beloved the fairest fair!'"

She is very special
I think she’s beautiful
And so very unusual...
She is intelligent,
also very sensual,
Both of which are to me
Relationship essentials
What most brought her to me
Was her sweet empathy
Which I appreciate
Most since I lost Peggy
She’s not a replacement,
I love her for her Self
She’s what it took to get
This widower off the shelf
She’s my loved Marina

And she has what it takes
To make my life complete

Or at least she believes so if she can't see you
And her skin sticks to her clothing, pulsing sweat from the sunlight
If you get under that bar long enough you'll stick like glue
The accidental shirt slips down under the finer linen
Embarrassed that she has the shirt on in the first place
The finer things in life come free anyway, that's what she says
But she keeps that bar over her eyes, your mind starts to race
And when she smiles
And you're in denial
You can't help erase
What you know in the back of your mind she is
She's just a teenage girl, does she know any better?
Just a teenage girl, certainly her dad wouldn't let her
A teenage girl, and you wish you could have her
But I'm a teenage guy, and she's mine
Though I can't help wondering why she wants you
And I hope and pray that one day she'll look back at me
You know she likes you ‘cause your hands are so damn big
Well how the hell am I supposed to compete with that?
She wears a black bar over her eyes so you don't have to see her
Other censorship seems a waste when she gives it away
The finer things in life come free anyway, that's what you think
But I swear that I'll make you pay for taking her from me
And when she smiles
And you're in denial
You can't help erase
What you know in the back of your mind she is

To make my heart sing out loud
And make me feel I'm alive

It's welcome in a soul of tears
Appreciated from this coldness
Give me romantic words and deeds
So pleasing to my eyes and ears
Make me happy for a little while
Give me romance everytime

476,Emotion,RomancePoemsTheRomanceOfTheKnightPoembyThomasChatterton,"The pleasing sweets of spring and summer past,
The falling leaf flies in the sultry blast,
The fields resign their spangling orbs of gold,
The wrinkled grass its silver joys unfold,
Mantling the spreading moor in heavenly white,
Meeting from every hill the ravished sight.
The yellow flag uprears its spotted head,
Hanging regardant o'er its watery bed;
The worthy knight ascends his foaming steed,
Of size uncommon, and no common breed.
His sword of giant make hangs from his belt,
Whose piercing edge his daring foes had felt.
To seek for glory and renown he goes
To scatter death among his trembling foes;
Unnerved by fear, they trembled at his stroke;
So cutting blasts shake the tall mountain oak.
Down in a dark and solitary vale,
Where the curst screech-owl sings her fatal tale,
Where copse and brambles interwoven lie,
Where trees intwining arch the azure sky,
Thither the fate-marked champion bent his way,
By purling streams to lose the heat of day;
A sudden cry assaults his listening ear,
His soul's too noble to admit of fear.-
The cry re-echoes; with his bounding steed
He gropes the way from whence the cries proceed.
The arching trees above obscured the light,
Here 'twas all evening, there eternal night.
And now the rustling leaves and strengthened cry
Bespeaks the cause of the confusion nigh;
Through the thick brake th'astonished champion sees
A weeping damsel bending on her knees:
A ruffian knight would force her to the ground,
But still some small resisting strength she found.
(Women and cats, if you compulsion use,
The pleasure which they die for will refuse.)
The champion thus: 'Desist, discourteous knight,
Why dost thou shamefully misuse thy might?'
With eye contemptuous thus the knight replies,
'Begone! whoever dares my fury dies!'
Down to the ground the champion's gauntlet flew,
'I dare thy fury, and I'll prove it too.'
Like two fierce mountain-boars enraged they fly,
The prancing steeds make Echo rend the sky,
Like a fierce tempest is the bloody fight,
Dead from his lofty steed falls the proud ruffian knight.
The victor, sadly pleased, accosts the dame,
'I will convey you hence to whence you came.'
With look of gratitude the fair replied-
'Content; I in your virtue may confide.
But,' said the fair, as mournful she surveyed
The breathless corse upon the meadow laid,
'May all thy sins from heaven forgiveness find!
May not thy body's crimes affect thy mind!'"
477,Emotion,RomancePoemsBoobyPrizeOrAFineRomance2PoembyDavidHarris,"Yesterday I wrote a joke poem,
Booby Prize Or A Fine Romance,
it told the story of how I met my wife,
all those years ago.
Yes, it was at her first husband’s funeral,
and yes a group of us
met a couple weeks later in a coffee bar,
but no it was not the drawing of a straw,
it was that I volunteered,
which I guess was lucky for me,
because on the 12th of September this year
we celebrate our 37th Wedding Anniversary.
Her first husband was a friend,
but he was a womaniser.
He met his dead in a suicide pact
with a fourteen-year-old girl.
He left a wife and two small children,
without a thought or care,
a month before Christmas that year.
Some said I was brave
to take on a ready-made family.
I do not think I was brave,
but very lucky that day.
We have had our ups and downs
like all families do,
but I would not change a bit of it.
The greatest gifts I received that day,
was a family for a lonely life,
and tolerance through trouble and strife.
Therefore, it is with thanks to them,
I am the man I am today."
478,Emotion,RomancePoemsAWomansLastSongFromAnUnpublishedRomancePoembyAlaricAlexanderWatts,"'Tis now that softening hour
When love hath deepest power,
To stir the fond heart with its dreams of delight;
When even the sickening thrill
Of hope deferred is still,
And the sunset of feeling grows golden and bright.
Oh believe me then in this,
Though, in moments of bliss,
Every pulse of thy heart found a response in mine;
When the storm upon us came,
I may merit thy blame,
But, so sweet was our sorrow, I could not repine.
Forgive me if I deemed
Fate kinder than it seemed,
If I smiled at the world and its wildest alarms;
If I inly blessed the grief
That bade thee seek relief
In the loving and cherishing pale of my arms.
Was loss of wealth severe
When a fond one was near
To soothe thee, and make thee a Crœsus in love?
Or vexations all must bear,
Worth a thought or a care,
Which a kiss, and thou'st owned it, a kiss could remove?
What are life's petty ills,
Its hectics or its chills,
Can they weaken affection or wither its flowers?
No; to hearts with feeling warm,
Love's the bow of the storm,
That grows broader and brighter the faster it showers.
Thus will it ever be,
On the world's troubled sea,
When two fond ones are cleaving in concert their way;
Though clouds sometimes may hide
Them, and tempests divide,
They'll be nearer than e'er when the rack drives away.
In life's genial spring,
As on Pleasure's light wing
Through her bowers of enchantment we joyously roved;
With feelings, hopes and fears,
Far too deep for our years,
In that spring-burst of sunshine we met and we loved!
Thou wert then of an age
When the stormy passions rage
More wildly the harsher earth's wise ones reprove;
Pride and gentleness combined,
In thy deep heart were shrined;
The softness and fire of the eagle and dove!
Though Fortune was unkind,
To thy merits ever blind,
Still thy soul could unstooping her malice endure;
And what though thou wert thrown
On this wide world alone,
Did I love thee the less for being friendless and poor?
What is wealth, what is wealth,
Could it purchase me health,
Or secure for us moments more blissful than those
We together oft have passed,
When even Fate's chilling blast
Could not ruffle our own little heaven of repose!
Surely not, surely not;
Every grief was forgot,
Whilst enfolded by thee on thy bosom I hung;
And though tempests raged above,
They were harmless to love,
For the wilder the ruin the closer we clung.
But the sun has looked his last,
And the day is fading fast,
And night's shades are o'erwhelming my heart and my song;
Fare thee well, a long farewell;
I have broken the spell
That has bound me to earth and its witcheries too long!"
479,Emotion,RomancePoemsMayDecemberRomancePoembyJuanOlivarez,"She is May,
And I am December.
She appeared one day,
And she fanned the embers.
She is morning,
And I am twilight.
She's just started soaring,
And I'm scared of heights.
She is so fresh,
Like the morning dew.
I'm an old geyser
That no longer spews.
I guess I'm as lucky,
As lucky can be.
Because with so many young bucks,
She decided on me.

it doesn’t want to miss.
but in the bloom
hug-warmth’s
new heights are told,

the parallel of its blissful romance
is nowhere found."
481,Emotion,RomancePoemsBlackRoseRomancePoembyAngelRoseRomance,"Love is pain
So scars remain
Mind and body,
It's all the same
I love you now
Like I loved you then
Why do we have to just stay friends?
Is this just my fantasy
because you act like we were never meant
to be
I send you roses, they're usually white
But now that I have changed my mind,
They are blood red
You ask me why and I say
because my wrists bleed for you in the night
I sit alone in my room, listening to the music
That we used to
Then I slowly start to notice that everything
We had has come to an end
Right now I'm hurt and you don't
understand
So let go of my hand
At least until you understand

482,Emotion,RomancePoemsRomanceSonámbuloPoembyFedericoGarcíaLorca,"Green, how I want you green.
Green wind. Green branches.
The ship out on the sea
and the horse on the mountain.
With the shade around her waist
she dreams on her balcony,
green flesh, her hair green,
with eyes of cold silver.
Green, how I want you green.
Under the gypsy moon,
all things are watching her
and she cannot see them.
Green, how I want you green.
Big hoarfrost stars
come with the fish of shadow
that opens the road of dawn.
The fig tree rubs its wind
with the sandpaper of its branches,
and the forest, cunning cat,
bristles its brittle fibers.
But who will come? And from where?
She is still on her balcony
green flesh, her hair green,
dreaming in the bitter sea.
--My friend, I want to trade
my horse for her house,
my saddle for her mirror,
my knife for her blanket.
My friend, I come bleeding
from the gates of Cabra.
--If it were possible, my boy,
I'd help you fix that trade.
But now I am not I,
nor is my house now my house.
--My friend, I want to die
decently in my bed.
Of iron, if that's possible,
with blankets of fine chambray.
Don't you see the wound I have
from my chest up to my throat?
--Your white shirt has grown
thirsy dark brown roses.
Your blood oozes and flees a
round the corners of your sash.
But now I am not I,
nor is my house now my house.
--Let me climb up, at least,
up to the high balconies;
Let me climb up! Let me,
up to the green balconies.
Railings of the moon
through which the water rumbles.
Now the two friends climb up,
up to the high balconies.
Leaving a trail of blood.
Leaving a trail of teardrops.
Tin bell vines
were trembling on the roofs.
A thousand crystal tambourines
struck at the dawn light.
Green, how I want you green,
green wind, green branches.
The two friends climbed up.
The stiff wind left
in their mouths, a strange taste
of bile, of mint, and of basil
My friend, where is she--tell me--
where is your bitter girl?
How many times she waited for you!
How many times would she wait for you,
cool face, black hair,
on this green balcony!
Over the mouth of the cistern
the gypsy girl was swinging,
green flesh, her hair green,
with eyes of cold silver.
An icicle of moon
holds her up above the water.
The night became intimate
like a little plaza.
Drunken 'Guardias Civiles'
were pounding on the door.
Green, how I want you green.
Green wind. Green branches.
The ship out on the sea.
And the horse on the mountain.
Translated by William Logan
Original Spanish
Verde que te quiero verde.
Verde viento.  Verdes ramas.
El barco sobre la mar
y el caballo en la montaña.
Con la sombra en la cintura
ella sueña en sus baranda,
verde carne, pelo verde,
con ojos de fría plata.
Verde que te quiero verde.
Bajo la luna gitana,
las cosas la están mirando
y ella no puede mirarlas.
Verde que te quiero verde.
Grandes estrellas de escarcha,
vienen con el pez de sombra
que abre el camino del alba.
La higuera frota su viento
con la lija de sus ramas,
y el monte, gato garduño,
eriza sus pitas agrias.
¿Pero quién vendrá?  ¿Y por dónde...?
Ella sigue en su baranda,
verde carne, pelo verde,
soñando en la mar amarga.
Compadre, quiero cambiar
mi caballo por su casa,
mi montura por su espejo,
mi cuchillo por su manta.
Compadre, vengo sangrando,
desde los puertos de Cabra.
Si yo pudiera, mocito,
este trato se cerraba.
Pero yo ya no soy yo,
Ni mi casa es ya mi casa.
Compadre, quiero morir
decentemente en mi cama.
De acero, si puede ser,
con las sábanas de holanda.
¿No ves la herida que tengo
desde el pecho a la garganta?
Trescientas rosas morenas
lleva tu pechera blanca.
Tu sangre rezuma y huele
alrededor de tu faja.
Pero yo ya no soy yo.
Ni mi casa es ya mi casa.
Dejadme subir al menos
hasta las altas barandas,
¡dejadme subir!, dejadme
hasta las verdes barandas.
Barandales de la luna
por donde retumba el agua.
Ya suben los dos compadres
hacia las altas barandas.
Dejando un rastro de sangre.
Dejando un rastro de lágrimas.
Temblaban en los tejados
farolillos de hojalata.
Mil panderos de cristal,
herían la madrugada.
Verde que te quiero verde,
verde viento, verdes ramas.
Los dos compadres subieron.
El largo viento, dejaba
en la boca un raro gusto
de hiel, de menta y de albahaca.
¡Compadre!  ¿Dónde está, dime?
¿Dónde está tu niña amarga?
¡Cuántas veces te esperó!
¡Cuántas veces te esperara,
cara fresca, negro pelo,
en esta verde baranda!
Sobre el rostro del aljibe
se mecía la gitana.
Verde carne, pelo verde,
con ojos de fría plata.
Un carábano de luna
la sostiene sobre el agua.
La noche se puso íntima
como una pequeña plaza.
Guardias civiles borrachos
en la puerta golpeaban."
483,Emotion,RomancePoemsHavenOfRomancePoembyDraniaHaplern,"Romance
came at morning
love story without end
we stole a kiss by the river
the haven of love way down in the glen
soprano voices came hither
ecstasy lingered then
with the bliss of
romance.
Only a shy young maiden was I
how could my heart ever know
that love was steadily seeping
into the innocence of my soul?
Romance
came with glory
love's fable now I pen
we fell in love one September
at a haven of love way down in the glen
your kind caress I remember
I was eager to dance
on wings of true
Romance."
484,Emotion,RomancePoemsRomanceInTheSunPoembyJoyceHemsley,"Feminine...the 'dreamy' kind
every man adores her,
beautiful in summer sun
when Mr. Romance calls her.
He sings nostalgic melodies
introduced discreetly,
mellow notes to melt the heart
Bliss, when rendered sweetly.
He sends white lilies to her room
to celebrate each new occasion;
her boudoir's filled with fresh perfume
and sensuous adoration.
Golden rings upon her finger
give hope of many years to come
and unforgettable memories linger
of romance in the summer sun."
485,Emotion,RomancePoemsASombreRomancePoembyMatthewHolloway,"A sombre romance
~
Dying flowers in a vase
Mindless routines becoming motions
Without a thought of feeling
Carrying on for the sake of it all
A kiss cold to the lips
What this house has seen in our time
Were these walls to talk
How they would speak about
A sombre romance
The bottles of wine shared
Over a film and Chinese
The tiring pretence
That things are as they were
That nothings changed
New flowers daily, smaller bunches
Forced into a crowded vase
Nothings new anymore
Even this old pretence
Why we keep denying the inevitable
That even the walls know
This sombre romance
Has seen its day"
486,Emotion,RomancePoemsRomanceInTheAirPoembyMarilynLott,"It started with a little smile
A flirt and bat of the eye
For Elaine saw the man
She wanted to be her guy
John knew before too long
His life was about to transform
Elaine was so pretty and so sweet
She sort of took him by storm
So the courting began before long
Friends they were from the start
And as feelings began to change
Love festered and grew in their hearts
Nothing would be the same again
It was bound to happen, it’s true
Much thought in both their minds
It didn’t happen out of the blue
Of course there is a happy ending
A life they wanted to share
And it all started when one day
Romance was in the air!"
487,Emotion,RomancePoemsTheKingOfRomancePoembyTiaMaria,"You rule the kingdom of hopes & dreams
with your tales of romance you carefully weave
And then when it seems there could be no more

Who could be the queen of your heart
every girl longs to fill the part
To bring to life such a fantasy
Being so well loved is pure ecstacy"

Embrace in the insipid moonlight
It’s impossible to deny fate
Our passion for each other is on a roll
Our feelings are so hard to control
It’s impossible to deny fate
You and me we have our struggles
But what couples don’t have troubles?
It’s impossible to deny fate
When I express my feelings everything I say is true
True love isn’t just kissing all over you
It’s impossible to deny fate
Like paper always sticks to glue
I will always be there for you
It’s impossible to deny fate
I love you because of your heart
My love for you is off the charts
It’s impossible to deny fate
Being with you is a blessing
Laughing together, singing songs, caressing
It’s impossible to deny fate
I want to stay with you for years
I’ve sworn that I will never drink beer
After the wedding we pull the car in and lock the gate
It’s impossible to deny fate"

The one who always awoke instantly from the sound of:
An angry door slamming,
A single tear hitting the cold floor,
And a razor blade being dismantled from its safe covering.
But when she was with him-
With his arms of steal padlocked around her,
Not even the sound of his heartbeat awoke her,
Instead it soothed and rocked her to sleep,
Their two fragmented hearts beating so close,
But they never got a chance to beat to
Beat as one."
494,Emotion,RomancePoemsRememberRomancePoembyLottieHammond,"Old fashioned movies
With true love to gain
Always remember romance
And kiss in the rain.
The only thing you have
Is the hope of his kiss
And waiting for the day
Is all that you miss
In love, in romance
Looking into his eyes
Is all you want to do
No time for any lies
So send him a text
Drop him a line
And maybe one day
He’ll take the time
He’ll fall for you
And never look back
Your life will be bright
No time for dark, no black
I hope he’s always there
To take away my pain
And to remember romance
And to kiss in the rain"
495,Emotion,RomancePoemsARomanceInTheNightSkyPoembyAnthonyFry,"Tempered by the friction, of each others loneliness.
Brightly wooed, in our own glad glorious way.
We chasing each other, along those milky ways.
Conditions and competition, fight like mariners.
Love stars, are more dewy luminous than others.
Why separate them, a love creates poetic illusion.
A perspective, like pleasing soft melancholy music.
Happy about joyful liberation, awaking upon life.
Consequently life is also a dream, in relative ways.
Cooperation swinging in or out, of our endurance.
Farewell to daylight, we enjoy a moonlit night sky.
Ourselves no longer strangers, sing like chaffinch."
496,Emotion,RomancePoemsItsFebruaryAndRomanceIsInTheAirPoembyDavidHarris,"It’s February and romance is in the air.
Shops are filled with things to give your lady fair.
Heart shaped items to express I love you
for both men and women to confess their love is true.
Someone somewhere is making a big fat profit out of this
and certainly isn’t me.
Florist jack their prices up just for Valentines Day.
In Fact, everyone does the same,
because they know only too well
people are going to buy them of pay the consequence,
and consequence could be nasty.
Therefore, if you see someone
with a rolling pin implanted in their head,
or a frying pan with a big dent in it
you will know someone has forgotten
and paid the consequence.

498,Emotion,RomancePoemsChristmasRomancePoembyCPSharma,"There is heaven in rosy looks
Hell lies in gloomy glance
There is sunshine all around
Why not make it a romance! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
Our life is a ballroom dance
Enjoy it you have a chance
Tired! See how others dance
Be happy in their love trance.
Time and tide wait for none
Why don't make life a fun
Calumny and anger shun
Others hearts will be won.
If jealousy you nurse
Smoldering fire traverse
Life becomes a curse
Can't sing love verse.
This Christmas let's dance
Let's take a chance
Harmony & peace advance
Hatred from heart distance."
499,Emotion,RomancePoemsPoliticalRomancePoembyBarryVanAllen,"I am truly scared for him,
I am not sure that I would vote for him,
I believe he needs experience,
but, ... this seems like his time.
His message has a resonance,
as if he's going to make a real difference,
not for some, but  ALL  this time,
... political romance.
Bobby had that vision,
and they put an end to him,
in a kitchen in Los Angeles,
since then, the light has dimmed.
Damned partisans without regard,
for fear of non-selection,
simply vote along the party lines,
and pray there's no detection.
Blindly followed leadership,
if you can call it that,
beg for more, demanding more,
...  and threaten through their party hats!
They view the people as an evil,
to maintain a ' cushy ' circumstance,
their employers are annoying,
and so they lie to us with political romance.
I am truly scared for him,
because an educated black man,
is still the biggest fear of far too many,
that refuse to understand.
I've heard it said that there are none so blind,
as those that will not see,
that cut off their nose to spite their face,
and somehow think that makes them pretty.
It only takes one idiot,
and one finger on a trigger,
to end the dreams of millions,
by killing one smart...  dreamer!
I'm not sure that  I'll vote for him,
his experience, an issue,
his intellegence is not in question,
but, will his motives be diffused?
This feels like the time to me,
to ask for one more dance,
and hope the partner understands,
- - - more than political romance!

Up on you

Life's too small"
501,Emotion,RomanticPoemsRomanticLovePoembyKeithPhilippsen,"Romance is a must for most young hearts
Gestures of love broken in tiny parts
A dozen roses, a chocolate heart,
Writing a poem with all your heart,
A cute little card with x’s and o’s
Sittin’ by the fire warming your toes
A candle lit dinner down by the beach
You both come in a pair not in a peach
Long conversations late into the night
Love is there and romance is in sight
Just a bear hug for you just like this
Romance is even just the right kiss…"
502,Emotion,RomanticPoemsThePedanticRomanticPoembySuzanneHayasaki,"Whisper some Shakespeare in my ear.
Maybe a scene from A Midsummer Night's Dream.
Or better yet, copy a sonnet, longhand, complete
With misspelled words and archaic punctuation.
Send me a text referencing Eliot.
Offer to anaesthetize me and lay me on your table
Like a movable feast for a poor man
Who has nothing to give but another man's love.
Or just this once, speak to me.
In your words, from your soul.
Be pedestrian, be predictable, be cliché.
Say plain words in a plain way.
But make me want to listen
To the tone in your voice
To the catch in your throat
To the hitches and hesitations.
And then kiss me.
Let your lips tell me what your words can't.
And look for my reply in these blue eyes.
Then leave language behind for tonight."
503,Emotion,RomanticPoemsASuccessfulRomanticMarriagePoembyAkhtarJawad,"A pre marriage courtship is a lovely adventure,
Being attracted to beauty, playing hides and seeks,
Waiting for hours on the road opposite to a bedroom,
On the first floor just to have a glimpse of a teen aged girl,
Chasing that girl on a bicycle up to a girls college,
Where one could not get in and waiting for her,
Outside the college till the bells announced,
She’s about to come out and then chasing once again,
Until she got in the gates of her lovely home!
Regretted holidays for missing the routine!
What is it, foolishness or an adventure?
Is it merely a call of nature?
It might be foolishness but when responded,
By the eyes of a sweet and lovely nice girl,
An element enters in this wild foolishness,
An element that softens the stones of hearts,
And the adventure when blended by love,
What else it is, other than romance,
What a life is that without a romance!
A duty imposed for just to reproduce!
Stealing a moment to meet somewhere outside,
Be a windy evening of a hot summer noon,
Or a sunny noon of a cold foggy morning,
A moonlit night on the bank of a river,
In the pleasant rains with roses and jasmines,
To be wet in love and to come back in senses,
Before t’s too much with the dreams of future,
Gripping and controlling the call of nature,
Without all that the life remains incomplete,
Sweet memories we need in the icy old age!
Bitter realities of life when kill the adventure,
Adventure goes in coma but love never dies,
Understanding each other, accepting each other,
With the weaknesses exposed after marriage,
Changes the nature of love completely,
Compromises are made, sacrifices are made,
When a wife takes care of his childish husband,
She behaves like a stern but loving grandmother,
But the child is not annoyed at all,
He enjoys a carefree lovely nice life,
Ignoring a few painful casual strife,
Three cheers for a beautiful lovely nice wife!"
504,Emotion,RomanticPoemsToTheRomanticTraditionistsPoembyAllenTate,"I have looked at them long,
My eyes blur; sourceless light
Keeps them forever young
Before our ageing sight.
You see them-too strict forms
Of will, the secret dignity
Of our dissolute storms;
They grow too bright to be.
What were they like? What mark
Can signify their charm?
They never saw the dark;
Rigid, they never knew alarm.
Do not the scene rehearse!
The perfect eyes enjoin
A contemptuous verse;
We speak the crabbed line.
Immaculate race! to yield
Us final knowledge set
In a cold frieze, a field
Of war but no blood let.
Are they quite willing,
Do they ask to pose,
Naked and simple, chilling
The very wind's nose?
They ask us how to live!
We answer: Again try
Being the drops we sieve.
What death it is to die!
Therefore because they nod,
Being too full of us,
I look at the turned sod
Where it is perilous
And yawning all the same
As if we knew them not
And history had no name-
No need to name the spot!"

506,Emotion,RomanticPoemsHowToLoveARomanticGuyPoembyTapan,"The romantic one is the rarest one
And he is just not like the other folks
You must learn, my dear, how to talk
To him, unlike those common folks.
Don't bore him with your silly folk tales
He has finer tastes, not coarse like ale
Don't expect of him the heathen tongues
Or folk dance set to cheap barbaric songs.
Talk to him in sweetness, of love, romance
Reach out to his heart with gentle cadence
Utter not a rude word, a single rude word
Or play with him silly, dirty mind games
For he of gentle nature might take offence
And once his mood is off
He may for ever switch off
What shall you gain by losing such a one
A romantic guy is the rarest one
If ever you find a romantic man
Latch on to him as fast as you can
For once he goes, you'll never ever
Find in this life another for sure.
He of classic mind will abhor folk things
He'll seek harmony in even littlest things
Don't expect him to folk dance
For he'll dance ballet in the evenings
And he'll take you to the night's ball
And waltz you down the aisle
And lock his rings with your rings.
Your Kashmiri is at best a folk dance
While Odishi has a pure classical stance
If you want to be in love with the Classics
Just leave your folks behind, and embrace
Some of your lover's romantic basics.
Bring him to mood with your sweetest words
If sweet ones you know not, just avoid rude words
Reach out to him with your sweetest songs
And he is sure to sing his own sweet songs
Soon your melody will make his heart dance
And in his hour of joy he'll quickly embrace
You to his bosom in thrall, my dear Beloved
As a sweet wife in love to her man belonged."
507,Emotion,RomanticPoemsTheReturnOfTheRomanticPoembyBijayKantDubey,"There comes a time in everybody's life
When one keeps floating and flowing
In a dreamy
And dramatic way,
Feeling free and uninhibited,
Smiling with the flowers,
Talking to
And smiling
In the adda of his own,
A hero in the making
Stylistic and fashionable,
Becoming the matter of the talk
Of the side heroines
And the heroine.
But there also a comes a time in the life
Of the hero
When he starts falling,
The flowers come not into the sweet dreams,
Under the stars and the moon
And their mysterious twinkles and moonshine,
Babbles he not,
Smiles he not,
Prefers to be alone,
Returning dejected and forlorn
From the Love City
Of the beloved,
Slapped by the hardcore realities
Of this real life.
O young man playing the role
Of a musician,
A singer
Or an announcer,
Life is not the stage of a theatre,
Life is not
What you envisage
Into the sweet dreams of yours,
Life not so imaginative and fanciful,
Look back on those
Who struggle, sacrifice and suffer
And for whom look you
A hero,
But that too is coming to a close
With the theatre closing down!
Frustrated and forlorn, the romantic
Returning into the steps of his,
Fatigued and depressed
After being beaten
on the life front
And failed,
Loved and lost,
Flirted and deceived he
And now life deceiving
And betraying him
For what he did,
What he took it for romanticism
As to love and abandon
Is not at all romanticism
And to dress stylistically too is not
As a loafer too dresses in the likewise manner."

You divide me into many pieces.
We are alone at that place,
We are rarely in that case.
We are alone in this room,
When my red flower starts to bloom.
I muse on your face under the full moon,
When my favorite music blasts to drum.
After you read my letter,
You make my mind  quieter,
By your smile so sweeter."

You bring the wine from the cooler
and both of you sip it gently.
Your hearts beat faster
with the warmth inside of you

Then the door opens

in no uncertain terms
to get out and go home."

Full with deep love and armed with teeth
What moon, earth or for that matter anything
She has needed none or expects something
Since weeks she had prepared beautiful ground
Now naturally she will be drunk and found
All her eagerness may come to an end
In Chris she has found an ally and friend
What else she has needed to enjoy?
No stars, no sky and no moon to joy
Let her explain what happened on that day
How did she enjoyed it till long night stay
What did he get in return for complete surrender?
Who was winner in race? Female or male gender
Let it remain there as their private domain
They might have talked about loneliness and pain
We may hear the version form poetess's encounter

Adults, the able-bodied, the infirm and children
Who love from the bottom of their hearts in a romantic mall.
Loving someone blesses love sources in Fall
When lovebirds hold hands and write love poems with their pen.
The opportunity to love is common to all.
Love and love some more until the call
Of love becomes an ingrained habit in women
Who love from the bottom of their hearts in a romantic mall.
Hazel Fidelia loved John at first sight in a college hall
Where John taught her to draw diagrams Venn.
The opportunity to love is common to all.
Become a love spender; don't be a love vendor but a love sender, tall
Lover who with other lovebirds maintain love and sustain sistren
Who love from the bottom of their hearts in a romantic mall.
Love even when from your lover you receive no phone call
To titillate your heart, to tingle your stomach pit when
The opportunity to love is common to all
Who love from the bottom of their hearts in a romantic mall."
516,Emotion,RomanticPoemsRecordsOfRomanticPassionPoembyCharlesHarpur,"THERE’S a rare Soul of Poesy which may be
But concentrated by the chastened dreams
Of constant hearts. Where’er the ministry
Of beautiful Nature hath enhanced the themes
Of some Petrarchian mind whose story gleams
Within the Past like a moon-silvered sea,
Or where grey Interest the spirit free
Of faithful Love hath caged in iron schemes,
Or round it stirr’d such dangers as o’erdrove
Long Ruin’s storm at last—there evermore
The very airs that whisper to the grove,
The echo’s mystery and the streamlet’s lore
Savour of Passion and transfusive pour
Abroad suggestions to heroic Love."
517,Emotion,RomanticPoemsRomanticTalesPoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"I love writing
With emotional fighting
To add something unusual
But still look it as casual
I make life to look wonderful
I wish everybody to become successful
Peacefully live with their expectations
With harmonious coexistence and relations
We are not here to score points
Take lives of others with joint conspiracy
It spoils the chance for living together
The message is spread with split offers
What do I try to write?
I still have nerves to excite
Write for readers to know some of the unknown aspects
That may sometimes urge them to act
Romantic tales are not my style
To work more in this direction is not goal
To remain in touch with human thinking
That is all I wish to perform rather than sinking"
518,Emotion,RomanticPoemsIHRizviAsARomanticPoetPoembyBijayKantDubey,"Iftikhar Hussain Rizvi is one of those Indian English poets
Of the seventies
Who seek to adhere to and perfect
The romantic traits rather than taking
Any other contemporary realms.
The kernel of romanticism he has definitely got
From the English and European masters and their theories of poetry which they used in
While practising their verse
And Rizvi can be o exception to it
As because he has taught and read English as a teacher.
Somewhere he seems to be leaning to Urdu lyrics and lyricism
Seen in the composition of shayaris
And he a shayar of these, a lyric writer,
Writing the lyrics of love, soulfully, heartfully.
To read Rizvi is come to feel that roses too appear
To be wounded and bleeding
If the heart is sad and broken and the ache of the heart,
None but Keats felt it.
Laila's pains are therein; those of Majnu's, burning for
Each other, pining for,
But the heartless, medievalist people cannot let them meet.
A lover's heart is the space of his writing and he inducts in dream, Colour, fancy and imagination to paint his ideas and images.
He is a lover; a dreamer who keeps loving and dreaming about
Man and the world,
Falling Petals, Unfading Blooms, Thirsty Pebbles,
Wandering Fragrance, Wounded Roses Sing.
Snowflakes of Dreams, Gathering Broken Glasses, Clouds in Cages, Fettered Birds, Dripping Wounds, Love Never Dies,
Haiku & Other Poems, The Valley Still Blossoms and others
The poetry-books to add to his corpus."
519,Emotion,RomanticPoemsARomanticRosePoembyAkhtarJawad,"Shall I just stand and let the eyes drink,
The wine in the petals is shocking pink,
Inhale your aroma and watch your dance,
Join naughty winds in a rainy romance,
Shall I touch you with the lover's lips?
But I know for me aren't nectar sips,
As you are smiling for the butterflies,
The colorful Angels from the skies,
Who is hidden in you, could you speak!
You are soft but dense, you'll never leak.
But the eyes of a lover with a lovely peep,
See Him smiling in your soul so deep"
520,Emotion,RomanticPoemsEpitaphForARomanticWomanPoembyLouiseBogan,"She has attained the permanence
She dreamed of, where old stones lie sunning.
Untended stalks blow over her
Even and swift, like young men running.
Always in the heart she loved
Others had lived, -- she heard their laughter.
She lies where none has lain before,
Where certainly none will follow after."
521,Emotion,RomanticPoemsLoveRomanticPoembySupriyaPrathapan,"It is a feeling which cannot be explained,
When your mind stops working and your heart is over-strained.
You are in a state of absolute delight,
And the face of your beloved always blurs your sight.
When poetry comes naturally,
And sleep eludes regularly,
When walking turns into prancing,
And you feel like singing and dancing.
When your beloved’s comfort and happiness becomes your obsession,
And your reason is repeatedly kicked by your passion.
Then ‘Love’ is the name of your condition,
For which there is only one prescribed medication:
'An equal love from your lover’s side',
This will calm your nerves and peace will reside.
Unrequited love is like severe body ache,
After all, the spurned lover’s heart is at stake.
His / Her eyes are water fountains,
He / She knows that true love can move mountains,
So he / she never stops trying,
Keeps heaving, hoping and crying.
But when love is reciprocated,
Every sentiment uttered for the beloved, seems exaggerated.
The thought of separation is unimaginable,
And feelings and sentiments become totally unmanageable.
The finest of all human sentiments,
‘Love’ knows no divisions, boundaries or impediments.
It spares no mortal soul,
In our lives, ‘Love’ plays an important role."
522,Emotion,RomanticPoemsRomanticMomentsPoembySandraFeldman,"The most exciting moments,
The ones the heart loves best,
Those deep romantic moments,
You wish would never end,
The ones you will remember,
The ones you can't forget,
Those great romantic moments,
Life's most wanted success.
The most romantic moments,
Are those you can't forget,
When Life was a good omen,
When Life had reached its crest,
Those most enchanting moments,
When all your life is blessed,
And finally, Beloved,
The search is put to rest,
As hands softly entangle,
And lips become caress."

And I am a poet who has composed you!

On the screen of imagination
In Romantic channel of thought!
I’ve searched for you in so many places!
I really don't know whether you will be here

527,Emotion,RomanticPoemsTheRomanticArtistPoembyBijayKantDubey,"The romantic,
How to get myself popular,
You say it,
I want to be a romantic,
How to be?
Should I dress myself,
Up-to-date, modern, frank and daring in my outlook
Or should I bring the used in boots, shirts and pants
Of my or your father, grandfather and great grandfather
As for to be a romantic?
An impressionist, a transcendentalist,
A smoker and writer
Experimenting with the cheroot and the cigarette,
The beedi and the hookah
To be a romantic,
A romantic writer.
Sometimes as a hippie, sometimes as a gipsy,
Isn't it,
Isn't the sweet dreams of yours,
But mark it
That such a living may be dangerous too
As this may mislead you too?
The drug-trafficker and the woman-trafficker,
The mafia don and the smuggler everywhere,
Just for to be a writer,
A romantic and mystic,
A transcendentalist and impressionist,
You destroy not yourself."
528,Emotion,RomanticPoemsRomanticLiePoembyJaleelPerinjanam,"You told me once
My care is amazing
You enlightened me
My eyes are passionate
I understood right away
Intention of your lie
Conceived you then
As a romantic liar
I am hypnotized
By stimulating splendour
Your adoring features
Touched innocent sense
Aggressive and obsessive
Kiss, knotted me to you
You were sensitive
Not to let me free
You became my dream
You became my psyche
You became my vision
You became my life
When I tie the knot
Masquerade taken out
Exemplified your
Inner parts of guts
I am aware now
You entrapped me
I want to find out
A romantic lie to escape
Flee from you at once
Glided on seven skies
Voyaged ocean limits
Probing for harmony
When I turned around
Find your burning tears
Dear, I’m back again
To be with you forever
How I save my face
Grab your lovely heart
I am searching for
Another romantic lie

530,Emotion,RomanticPoemsRomanticLovePoembyJohnLarsZwerenz,"Love the heart of all romance,
Must be of the sacred, laughing brook,
It must be of the eternal dance.
It must of her sable, dark look,
And of mine returning purity for purity.
Romance is love and love is romance.
It is of the azure, gleaming stream,
It is glory beyond all ecstasy.
It transcends all pines, all wines, all loftiness,
It is not a fabled, windy dream.
And when one is immersed in its ineffable caress,
When diamonds are donning her wedding dress,
The sun and the stars rise merely to greet
Yet another height where lips do meet."
531,Emotion,RomanticPoemsRomanticRomeoPoembyUriahHamilton,"Melancholy heart wavers
Like a sinking ship
From inward disappointment
Of life plans crumbling
On the unsavory streets
Of urban despair.
I dream of brushing
A beautiful woman’s hair
With the lavish possibilities
Of a millionaire,
But I daily catch curbside coins
Instead of the shimmering diamonds
I desire to place around her throat.
I’m never agitated for long,
Even though I have the empty stare
Of a preoccupied professor
At an archeological dig.
You would find me a sweet lover
In my little shack and poetry bed
Of hopeless resignation.
I know my insignificant place,
But I remain a romantic Romeo nonetheless."
532,Emotion,RomanticPoemsInDefenseOfRomanticLovePoembyLonnieHicks,"She said:
'In defense of Love I have only Faith and Necessity to offer;
without Romantic Love I fear the species dies.'
'Well' he said 'Romantic Love is a recent and western notion you see
and has existed only in the last 200 years and mostly in the west-invented I think by the Victorians and the Romantic Poets.''
'So tell me then my friend' he said 'what is Romantic Love good for? Is it not best to assure that a couple has good families involved since after all is it
not true that what is happening here is not a tryst but two families coming
together?
And too, no couple can make it alone on Love's Grist..
Arranged marriages has been the norm and is the best if the test is
longevity.'Romantic Love too often he said ends in Unromantic divorce miserable kids and True Love's Adversities.
'Are you saying then she said we jettison Romantic Love and its pursuits? '
'In that case let me state, then combine, what I take  to be True Love's true defenses.
Love its true, is the bonding start, but behind that is unlimited Faith in the
the Other unrelenting.
Otherwise we would all marry only near clones of ourselves
and destroy, in life and family, all variety.
'Even cave people insisted that marriages take place outside the tribe with others  not only to avoid incest but, too, to diversity the gene pool which
undiversified would result in the death of the species  due to genetic stultification.'
'So Romeo and Juliet came to a bad end but their  idea was correct. Opposites attract for good reason. It is built into the genes.
So in defense of Romantic Love there can be no higher defense than this.
What does marriage arrangements offer in retort- a dull family contract
endless tryists, and consorts where old men marry young girls who emotionally bolt and emotionally re-marry some younger buck.
Or if of similar age, they stay together for the sake of family.
Humm, too often this home feels like prison camp.
No carry me away to Love's excess even if under distress it may crumble
but lacking love in marriage is no bliss and looks more like accommodation
lacking True Love's Sweetness.
Ah, he said we both have our view on Love and no-love estrangement:
perhaps we two could make some arrangement and see if True Love blooms?
She smiled 'Well, they say True Love begins with humor.
Sure, let's talk some more.'
He said;
'Beautiful.'"
533,Emotion,RomanticPoemsTheEternalRomanticPoembyMadathilRajendranNair,"When I was young
Bloody hot-blooded
I fancied there could be
An eternal kiss
In an endless embrace
Then they called me
An indefatigable romantic
Later when my beard greyed
I knew eternal anything can't be
Everything that had begun
Had to end in vain
In vagrant time on endless run
Then they called me
A sophic akin to Socrates
Ah me, they didn't know
I remained still a romantic
For then I was in love
Not with fleshy lips alone
But with roaches even
I am a romantic
Endless that I am
Holding everything
Kiss, roach, touch and lips
Close to my chest
In an eternal clasp"

Because nights here are very cold.
And to catch just one moment ecstatic -
You should be very quick and bold.
There is no romantics in Joseph,
Balmont - angel with shattered dreams.
And Verblessness of sorrow -
that is the Russian theme.
Loneliness is coldness.
I love it - so let it be.

For in my verse I find joy in my voice as you're my Hobson's choice!
On the paper, I bare my soul to you as you are my vocalizing voice.
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle in my ground with romantic sound!
Thinking of you, I look at heavens and all I see is blue,
Blue skies, white clouds, but not one trace of you oh baby, baby!
I look deep into the dark night yet of no avail, I'm in love flu;
So I surfed within my heart I saw a star with your smile, oh baby baby.
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle in my ground with romantic sound!
Let me tell you how I feel: I love you along as galaxies live, oh baby!
Look into my eyes without a blink, an island pink, oh baby,
When the sun goes down, will you be there to walk in lawn? baby!
You can see my dreams, my sorrows, my joys and more, oh baby!
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle in my ground with romantic sound!
Pass the sugar baby; pass it, don't say maybe, baby, baby!
Kisses come with dawning sugar-sweet in the morning, oh Baby;
I become a waterwheel, turning and tasting you is my new hobby!
There's none for me so set our melody to blast forever, baby.

I have taken my diary
To compose some verses
By sitting on the couch
In my balcony on this full moon night.
My  thoughts seem to be paralysed
And my poetic mind like a physician
Tries to cure them in stead of writing verses.
The moon is walkiing but staring at me
And the romantic night is laughing at me  silently.
It seems to be  impossible
To compose the lovely verses
In the romantic light.
The happy conversation between us
Will not go on tonight.
My dreams are silent
Not to play with the moonlight.

Romantic hero and heroine take them well!
Romantic story captures the hearts of youths;
Romeo and Juliet now all like to end in comedy!
Famous love stories are written to be tragedies;
Love touches all and lives longer than humans!
Famous love comedies are romance in novels
And movies are full of such stories to please all!
Only love is vital and most important in life
Of all the virtues man cherishes most in world!
For, with love comes all virtues to one in life
As love is divine as pretty Nature that inspires!
Romance makes life interesting to live in the world
And for the sake of love all hardships are endured!
Comedy or tragedy, love is the central theme here
That drives romantic life to go on all terrains sure!"

An Indian romantic poet,

Thirsty Pebbles, Wandering Fragrance,
Wounded Roses Sing, Snowflakes of Dreams,
As his collections of poems.
Gathering Broken Glasses, Clouds in Cages,

A poet of love, colour and its romance,
Emotion and feeling

The flight of imagination,
He is ever fresh, ever songful.
A romantic poet, he draws from
Keats, Wordsworth and Shelley,
He is a poet of beauty, truth and goodness,
Dreamy and fanciful,
Dwelling far,
Into the realms.

And art as his vision,

Reviewed in loneliness and ends in never to be again
Revived so in the present life quite different ever.!

Crisis and family situation take a lion's share of time
In such a way that those thoughts of friends disappear

Remove all sadness and show to be fantastic
The poems are made as my heaven
The slight ideas get fine place even
How words strike mind in quick succession?
Form nice imagination with fast obsession
Romance with female friends and bright moon light
Oh, what a lovely desire to be expressed truly right
Why those dark nights don’t frighten me?
Why I touch all those stars and steal their twinkles in free?
Create their impression of sadness in fine poetical words
Feel so close to the almighty and spell it as holy from mouth of lords
Is poetry a means to cut jokes?
Cut some to size and unnecessarily poke
Does it not involve greater degree of appreciation?
I think it does and sometimes choke the throat and pronunciation
I try to control with tears and bring smile in between
But in fact it takes me to the extreme end and shows heaven
I take deep stock of it and compare what I get by composing poems
It is no less joy then what one gets from friends
I see with deep sense of human touch
Every time some incidence comes as such
I move with great care and involve
Rest ideas come in quickly and solve
It is divine blessing that you can think and form relation
An opinion about holy path, love or separation
How come you think with great pain about such sensitive things?
Unless you are gifted with invisible hands to create something
It is not poetic skill or some illogical presentation
It has even nothing to do with any kind of orientation
It is well imagined scene with mix of human feelings
That plays till end with souls together and willing"

The moon replied
How much happier I'd have been
if you had shown the lower half
all naked to me
with my sexiness
you wanted to compare O lady
I am more beautiful than thee
Years don't age nor frail me

till end of YOUR virginity
but still I can see ye
You too are as beautiful
but not more than me

do read my poem

Dr / Hussam: excise all the tumors
Dr / Salah: treat him by radiotherapy and chemotherapy
Dr / Mokhles: leave him to die
-
His mother was crying
While he was smiling
Then asked her Mum, think with me
The cancer enlarges everywhere
and its cells swim in my blood
its cells are undifferentiated
doctors don't know from where it came
it is from my heart
and when it grows, my heart grows
so I loved the whole world and loved its creator
cancer cells which went every where
visited my fingers
so I wrote the poems
haunted my brain and caused some pain
although increased its tension
but increased my attention
Mum, she travelled to Dubai
Incidence of cancer will increase in Asia
But her carcinogen femininity
Will remain in the Egyptian boy's heart
Mum, I want the operation
which is touching my hand
but she is the surgeon and she is the nurse
and I want the radiotherapy
from her eyes irradiation
and from her teeth flash
and I want the chemotherapy
a crumb of bread
she puts between my lips
then I want to die
on her bosom"
554,Emotion,RomanticPoemsRomanticPoembyBijayKantDubey,"Romantic,
Romantic,
Who is a romantic,
The making of a romantic,
How the man behind the curtain
Is the thing to know?
Romantic,
Romantic,
The word is no doubt musical and magical,
But who is the romantic,
One who is full of colour and image,
Fancy and imagination,
Dream and fantasy?
Or one who is creative,
A lover of Nature,
Hills, rivers, woods and valleys,
The village and the country,
The landscape and the greenery
In full myth and mysticism?
Or one who transforms dreams into realities,
Imagines and creates
As per Nature's plan,
Envisages and transforms,
Loves man, birds and beasts,
Sees the things in astonishment,
The world and Nature?
Or one who is a loafer,
A rambler, a roamer moving
Aimlessly
On the road of life,
Parting like a Romeo,
Loving and dodging,
Cheating and deceiving?"
555,Emotion,RomanticPoemsToARomanticPoembyAllenTate,"To Robert Penn Warren
You hold your eager head
Too high in the air, you walk
As if the sleepy dead
Had never fallen to drowse
From the sublimest talk
Of many a vehement house.
Your head so turned turns eyes
Into the vagrant West;
Fixing an iron mood
In an Ozymandias* breast
And because your clamorous blood
Beats an impermanent rest
You think the dead arise
Westward and fabulous:
The dead are those whose lies
Were doors to a narrow house."
556,Emotion,RomanticPoemsRomanticHaikuPoembyOskarHansen,"Your breath
Easy as a sleeping sea
Serenity
Your breathing
Whispering as a palm tree
Kissed by the breeze
As the sea caress
The mythical blue atoll
She smiles in her sleep"
557,Emotion,RomanticPoemsRomanticLovePoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"Love is not of minds alone;
Love is not of hearts that yearn;
Love is not of bodies entwined;
Love is more than the finest wine!
Love is not just when eyes see;
Love is not just when ears hear;
Love is not all sensory;
Love is more than what you dream!
Love is not of earthly mould;
Love is not human-designed;
Love is not ephemeral;
Love is more – predestined!
Love is not of sex, age, race;
Love is not for earth’s life-span;
Love is not togetherness;
Love is more- Eternity!"
558,Emotion,RomanticPoemsRomanticRecollectionPoembyAnantaMadhavan,"A winsome youth, whose visage bore
A galaxy of pimples on the forehead,
Noticed a girl running ahead
While tramping up a country road.
She seemed to float afar to catch up
With her runaway cat or puppy.  He strode
As fast as the muscles of his legs allowed
The pursuit of a dream.  Her tousled hair
Tumbled around her shoulders.  When he reached
The field where she was coyly cuddling her pet,
He tugged the visor of his cap over the forehead and
Flung the scarf around his face to hide the pimples.
She knew him from the market, with his twin dimples
In a horizontal smile, an enigmatic ‘emoticon',
Perhaps to be unravelled in a shared lifetime. Perhaps.
Can we intuitively feel the emotions of other people,
Protagonists or dramatis personae,
Whom we know or meet in life or read about
In histories, biographies, fairy tales and fictional romance?
Like the tug a man may feel
When attracted by a face or form or grace in motion,
Such as a runner at the finish?
‘I' is the slimmest letter in the Latin script of English,
But how bloated with meaning it is!
""Cogito, ergo sum"".
U-go, I-go, Ego."

Butterflies dancing

Come all out of door,

Sing a tone for life,
Life is nice, rich,

No one is poor;
Don't keep wrong

Help one another
To be really happy
To lead life with peace

I call myself poet
But remainquiet
When someone offers love
I hardly can believe
Love is such world
That it can be called holier than the lord
The word itself has solution
You can make straight away the resolution
Nobody can stall
Your path and call
It as futile way
Your journey has meaningful stay
I have seen riverflowing
The birds make chirping
The wind makes silent blow
I find it all in nature's glow
Love is in my blood
I find it in neighborhood
I also see it in all objects
Love is omnipresent and this is fact
Love makes your presence
And expresses true essence
Avail if you have chance
Feel no worries or remain tense"

Cautious in vain ! These rats that squeak so wild,
Squeak, not unconscious of their father's guilt.
Did ye not see her gleaming thro' the glade ?
Belike, 'twas she, the maiden all forlorn.
What though she milk no cow with crumpled horn,
Yet aye she haunts the dale where erst she stray'd ;
And aye beside her stalks her amorous knight !
Still on his thighs their wonted brogues are worn,
And thro' those brogues, still tatter'd and betorn,
His hindward charms gleam an unearthly white ;
As when thro' broken clouds at night's high noon
Peeps in fair fragments forth the full-orb'd harvest-moon !"

Listened to you murmured on the phone.
You doted and took pity on me.
You tired of drifting dreaming home
Weak lovesickness between you and me.
Dear Ah Hua, my dear sweetheart,
Please came with a bunch of wild lily.
Full of fragrance of spring around me.
My soft and weak heart was not alone.
Saw that you were into a trance.
You sincerely liked and loved me.
Your glowing eyes were burning love.
Both of us fell in love, fell in love.
Dear Ah Hua, my dear sweetheart,
Please went with a heart to heart lock.
Huangshan Hill Clouds changed magic so much.
Head over heels we were in love.
In spring, summer, autamn and winter.
You like a fire, I look of love.
Dawn, night, wind, rain, moon and sun, .
I am not weak after your care.
Love each other forever, we love.
Sour, sweet, bitter are romantic love.

567,Emotion,RomanticPoemsRomanticDreamsAllLovePoembyRameshTA,"All dreams of all people are not the same in world life;
Beautiful and best dreams of heart never die very soon;
Combination of heart, mind and soul produce unique dreams;
Dreams of love, God, paradise, heaven, one world are fine!
Every dream and achievement in the world is history ever;
Full scale dream of great ideas turn into reality sure;
Great dreamers are the leaders, poets and scientists ever;
High and noble dreamers have been achieved in the world!
Icons are the great heroes youngsters dream to be so ever;
just the image of such heroes trigger dreams wonderful...;
Keeping images of heroes as Gods they all dream high life;
Love in life and zeal to achieve best things all dream ever!
Multifaceted personalities are the heroes of dreams of all;
Noble and handsome heroes come in all dreams of young girls;
Obviously, the handsome hero of film ladies dream to live with;
Personality of angelic order all youngsters dream to be happy!
Queens of world beauties occupy the dreams of young men ever;
Rosy lips of heroes young ladies kiss long in dreams forever;
Stimulating passion in all lovers of great fame inspire all;
Tragedy of tiresome persons are compensated by dreams of beauty!
Universe itself is the greatest source of heavenly dreams ever;
Various charming poses of favourite personalities kindle dreams;
Whole world moves in zeal only by dreams of golden time to come!
X files of close encounters with mermaids are ever dreamlike sure;
Years of many noble dreams have become realities by ideas new..;
Zealous mood kindled by fine dreams moves all to romantic victory!"
568,Emotion,RomanticPoemsAHillWalkingPoemPartTwoTheRomanticPoetPoembyDanielBrick,"And where is that poem I sensed in sleep?
It may be caught within a swirling wind and
cannot come to rest, or trapped in the crevice
where two huge boulders lean and cannot break
free, or it may need its deep sleep, stretched out
on dry grass. The poem has its own life, it certainly
knows the hour of its birth, and will arrive
propelled by rhythms of mind and nature in tandem.
Its impulse is always toward revelation.
I wonder what impulse drives me: Do I walk
these grasslands and climb these hills to provoke
the poems whose writing is my familiar fulfillment?
Or do I write poems to justify my ceaseless walking
to no discernible goal? Will it matter if I find
today's poem barely floating on the green slime
of a stagnant pond? Will it be improved if I find it
crowned with solar glory on the high ledge
above a river valley? The poem will ever be
the middle ground between Nature and myself.
And so all things occur in their immediate motions -
grasses, hills, sunlight, my self, the animals,
the unwritten poems, plants and flowers and
the life-pregnant soil, the waters and the swirling air.
All fold together despite their strangeness,
their separateness. And I, the poet of this moment,
imagine how a natural love makes them familiars,
and dream it can last for evermore...
Oh, blessed persuasion! The poem is even now
within my ken! I can be quiet now. It comes apace!"

You are my life and my soul
Each beat of my heart is calling you, honey
I love you so much
I miss you so much
I wish that I can be with you someday

570,Emotion,RomanticPoemsRomanticNaturePoembyHasmukhAmathalal,"Poets are of romantic nature
They see beautiful colors of future
Every object seems of unique importance
They can’t stop from praising at once
Poet means an animal living in isolation
Keeps aloof from crowd and prefers no relation
Such is vague idea about serious poet
As he will prefer to remain always quiet
No one can live in vacuum
It is wrong on our part to assume
It can’t be minus or plus of sum
It is nature and tendency of some
As is well known to all
No one can resist opposite sex call
The nature is all set to balance
No one can dare to or come out of it at once
One of my female friends asked me of bad friends
How come anybody be sure of prevailing mood in the end?
It can be anybody’s guess if one is pulled with attraction
How can it be found in any of the expression?
She was considerate and very appreciative
One can’t be choosey or selective
It is how you evaluate or come to the terms
It like spreading of disease with germs
I posed a question whether she really wanted friends?
What was her mind acting with clear trend/
She was for all good friends with clear motives
I thought she was nice lady and very positive
But if I prefer to speak on myself
I would say I can’t think or help
As I am of romantic nature
And I want commitment very sure
It can’t depend on somebody’s mood
As poetry is my creation and food
I would starve if someone blocks my mind
Fills with hatred and acts as unkind
I would consciously ask straight
As I have no passion even for minute to wait
I believe it is not one way feeling
It must come instant and as willing
Some of them may say they won’t mind frankness
It should be expressed and talked on face
I would love those arguments for healthy relation
As it may not later on raise unnecessary questions
I provoke friends till get satisfactory answer
The honest answer may come from very fewer
Some may intelligently scoff off at even suggestion
I take pride in putting or making frank mention"

573,Emotion,RomanticPoemsAnotherRomanticPoembyEricAndrewJames,"The whole world is just
One romantic dramatic comedy
Horror after another
Each person
That hopeless romantic
Triumphant lowlife, scoundrel,
Angel, model
That we see every day
Every kiss is love
Every loss the worst
Things start to loose their meanings
In this same old romance
Comediatric dramatic horror series
With way to many seasons
Once a hit
Now watched
Out of pity
Waiting for another character
To get killed off
So they can return
To their own romantic
Comedy drama horror life cliché
Hoping one day
The movies won’t be able to say enough
To call it a romantic
Comedy horror drama
Of a life"

to the ragmen of the soul
for pennies on the dollar

what's owning for
if you lose this?
what will you tell your children's children
when they come to find
the trees stripped bare in summers
in a world of care,
I would ask them if I thought

Every time we look into each other's eyes, the flame goes higher and  higher
Lets hold each other hands to keep the fire alive
that's the only way our relationship can survive
Love without the romance can't go on forever
is like a car without the gas, that love is going nowhere
Romantic love makes your heart happy and your life sweet
Once you try it, you will never quit
Among all the reasons why we should be together
Lets romantic love to be the one, that hold us together

577,Emotion,RomanticPoemsARomanticComedyPoembyMichaelPruchnicki,"I'd like to write a romantic comedy
in four acts like Will Shakespeare did
Tragedy's not for me, you can see
by the bells and cap I wear
Clad like a court jester I can
dance and caper
with love as my chief motive
I adore outdoor action
the forest of Arden
populated by the likes
of Rosalind and Celia
Phebe and Audrey
daughters and country wenches
I could idealize a heroine
who usually masks herself
as a man, a swain, one
who deceives and is
deceived in turn
I would subject love to great
difficulty before consummation
in the darkest forests of night
'Amor vincit omnia! '
I would not render poetic justice
any oaf of a writer does that
My outcomes would be logical
& necessary -
how the characters act based
on their principles
I would balance characters
good guys over here
villains over there
reconciliation would be easy
in my romantic comedies
All's well that ends well
would be the keynote
struck in all its glory
by spooning lovers
Never mind love's labor
lost in a midsummer night's
dream even though all in all
it may be much ado about
nothing
but that's as I like it!"

Just for 30 minutes, it is momentary.
Young, charming and lovely
Sincere, shrew and brainy.
Ow! words fail how I was happy.
Sometimes, for the earth to be peaceful,
For colorful flowers to bloom,
For nutrient plants to grow,
Mankind stares up the sky.
Ow! they wish the clouds for shower mild.
To present a cool rain-drop,
Blue sea must be burnt off.
Where is justice for nature right?
The blood of her heart vaporizes.
Ow! which mindful one does memorize?
Heart absorbs all feelings and suffers
When much, they run over through eyes as tears.
My God! is it real nature?
To own love-blooms in chest deepest,
Ow! it's inner raining running into mad.
'Her eyes are demure diamonds
Below the rainbows of eyebrows'
I compose this sort of verses with rhythm,
And feel it by myself as a gem.
Ow! does she love poems?
Truth and untruth, equity and inequity.
As she crave truth and equity,
I notice that she has fair fancy,
And she is gifted in poetry.
Ow! words fail how I feel ecstasy.
She loves verses, I love verses.
Though we're strangers and have different breaths,
Poems make us two not to mope.
Poems make us two hearts to close.
Ow! how a brave beauty like a rose! ! !
Without appealing, without tempting,
She melts in heart beating.
Arteries and veins allow her in circulating.
Finally, fingers shake and grasp a pen.
Ow! it becomes 'she, a romantic poem'"

A Waltz in blue,
A Rhapsody,
Also in Blue.

But so is blue,
Blue oceans bring me,
Close to You,
Your eyes, your look,
The color blue,
Can love be just,
Blue thoughts of you?"
581,Emotion,RomanticPoemsNotRomanticPoembyJohnCarterBrown,"My wife says I'm not romantic,
I don't suppose I am
I think I'm just an average bloke
Doing the best I can;
I think about my lady
And not just now and then
I tell her that I love her
As much as other men.
But this is  NOT  romantic
It's just not good enough!
She wants the constant flattery
She wants the gooey stuff;
Not just every weekend
Or even days between
She wants the flowers hourly
And treating like a queen.
If truth be told, I'm lazy
And think it doesn't matter
I haven't got the eloquence,
The charm, the chat, the patter;
I've got to be quite honest,
Straightforward and pedantic
My wife is right, I'm not
And never will be a romantic.

Grabbing me close to whisper in my ear.
I realize you're only what I hold dear,
And losing you forever is my only fear.
Along with the back ground of acoustical guitars,
You're sending me sailing through heavenly stars.
Now, I have come up with the greatest notion.
Lets take a vacation over looking the ocean.
Rubbing in romance with sun tan lotion,
Our senses can come alive with the scenic potion.
We'll order champagne from one of the bars,
And toast to the food life under brightly lit stars.
Another idea has just rattled my brain.
Tickets for two on a slow moving train.
To view water falls in upper State, Maine.
Then walk hand in hand down some long shady lane.
Out in the wilderness away from all cars,
We both can make wishes on fast shooting stars.
Deep down inside is a raging hot fire.
You have fast become my hearts desire
Like the stars in the sky you're lifting me higher.
If I said it different, you can call me a liar.
When our first child is born and I'm handing cigars.
Deep in my eyes is where you'll see all the stars."

A loving tune flowing thru the air
Beautiful you coming down the stairs
A glowing angel with a gorgeous smile
Sent from the heavens above
A Birthday surprise and a tearful joy
A romantic night for you to cherish
Like a scene from the movies
The beautiful actress gets her man
A dream that comes true
Tears of joy and surprise
Wishing you a loving Birthday
Full of love and joy
A kiss and a slow dance
Holding you tightly, whispering
Happy Birthday and loving you
A birthday wish for you comes true"

Love is what your synonym is,
Your love makes me free,
Hold me ever closer,
Hatred I never want baby.
A romantic song I dedicate,
To you from my heart's gate,
Tender love is what I want,
I hope you will certainly grant!"

587,Emotion,RomanticPoemsTheRomanticPoembyAdamMickiewicz,"'Silly girl, listen!'
But she doesn't listen
While the village roofs glisten,
Bright in the sun.
'Silly girl, what do you do there,
As if there were someone to view there,
A face to gaze on and greet there,
A live form warmly to meet there,
When there is no one, none, do you hear?'
But she doesn't hear.
Like a dead stone
She stands there alone,
Staring ahead of her, peering around
For something that has to be found
Till, suddenly spying it,
She touches it, clutches it,
Laughing and crying.
Is it you, my Johnny, my true love, my dear?
I knew you would never forget me,
Even in death! Come with me, let me
Show you the way now!
Hold your breath, though,
And tiptoe lest stepmother hear!
What can she hear? They have made him
A grave, two years ago laid him
Away with the dead.
Save me, Mother of God! I'm afraid.
But why? Why should I flee you now?
What do I dread?
Not Johnny! My Johnny won't hurt me.
It is my Johnny! I see you now,
Your eyes, your white shirt.
But it's pale as linen you are,
Cold as winter you are!
Let my lips take the cold from you,
Kiss the chill o f the mould from you.
Dearest love, let me die with you,
In the deep earth lie with you,
For this world is dark and dreary,
I am lonely and weary!
Alone among the unkind ones
Who mock at my vision,
My tears their derision,
Seeing nothing, the blind ones!
Dear God! A cock is crowing,
Whitely glimmers the dawn.
Johnny! Where are you going?
Don't leave me! I am forlorn!
So, caressing, talking aloud to her
Lover, she stumbles and falls,
And her cry of anguish calls
A pitying crowd to her.
'Cross yourselves! It is, surely,
Her Johnny come back from the grave:
While he lived, he loved her entirely.
May God his soul now save!'
Hearing what they are saying,
I, too, start praying.
'The girl is out of her senses!'
Shouts a man with a learned air,
'My eye and my lenses
Know there's nothing there.
Ghosts are a myth
Of ale-wife and blacksmith.
Clodhoppers! This is treason
Against King Reason!'
'Yet the girl loves,' I reply diffidently,
'And the people believe reverently:
Faith and love are more discerning
Than lenses or learning.
You know the dead truths, not the living,
The world of things, not the world of loving.
Where does any miracle start?
Cold eye, look in your heart!'"
588,Emotion,RomanticPoemsARomanticWeatherPoembyAsifAndalib,"On such a cloudy day why you are far away?
Lightning is writing in sky what I want to say
The cloudy sky is like my gloomy face
The thunderbolts are showing my distress
The raindrops are like my sorrowful tears
My soul is on your way like pioneers
The murmur of the leaves is like my whisper
Please meet me in such a romantic weather"
589,Emotion,RomanticPoemsImmortalRomanticPlaywrightPoembyRameshTA,"Born and dead on Avon the same date,23rd April
Romantic playwright Shakespeare none can ignore!
He ever lives in his 32 Plays and 154 Sonnets......!
His plays are mirror to life reflecting about humans
In seven ages of men opening the curtain to show
As child, pupil, lover, soldier, courtier, wise, old man!
What a quintessence of precious dust man is, he says!
Warrior, philosophic in nature, gentle and noble man
Surely cannot take revenge on murderer of his father!
Unlike Hamlet, Prince Hal jovial with fat Falstaff, yet
At the time of emergency fights bravely for nation
And proves himself to be worthy son to his father!
That character Shakespeare develops further into
His favourite hero Richard III and gives a sketch
And full picture to the best he can to immortality!
Comedy or Tragedy or history, he shows his skill,
Power and range depicting characters none can forget
And refer in life parallel happenings to one and all!
Whoever loved, that loved not at first sight.....?
Love at first sight we came to know from him first!
Romeo and Juliet & Antony and Cleopatra live long!
Star crossed lovers' hearts stricken with arrow
Cupid boy releases from his bow never fails and
Lovers live or die together to be immortals ever!
Cleopatra's serpentine beauty captures hearts of
Emperor Julius Caesar and his faithful friend Antony
Till death and suicides herself by the bite of snake!
He creates romantic love life controlled by Nature
At first and at the end of his career makes Nature
Go under the control of man envisaging future too!
For him life is such stuff as dreams are made on
And is rounded off with a sleep at the end sure!
Closing curtain so in blank verse he ends in sonnets!"

591,Emotion,RomanticPoemsARomanticNightPoembyDanielChapman,"You come in and sit down while looking around
I tell you don’t be afraid just relax for this is your night
I’ve prepared all day for this one perfect night
Topped with music, food, wine and a flickering candle light
We eat, drink, laugh, and talk just for starters
I began to gaze into your stars stolen from the sky eyes
As you lay in my arms looking up at me in utter surprised
I stand you up and slowly walk you into my room
I began to undress you piece by piece
While the aroma of the room puts you at ease
I tell you to lie down flat on your stomach
Then your fantasy's and fascinations’ begin to run wild
Now I have a strong appetite for your love and I want it now
Yet the moment is not now so I tell myself to slow down
So I begin giving you a full body massage
Not just any massage I mean really caressing your every curve
Tonight I’m your servant and I’m ready to serve
I smell and inhale a deep breath of air from your hair
I slowly and passionfully kiss the back of your neck
As I go down your body, kissing alot and not missing a spot
You moan in acceptance and squirm in the sheets
I roll you over in a burst of excitement and delightment
I admire your body in its full entirety
For a second I pause, A body so beautiful even with flaws
I complete the front of you the same way I did your back
Paying close attention to areas that I need not mention
Your body begins to shiver and I know what that means
So I continue to go at it until you and your body screams
I can feel you blood pulsating as I slowly raise up
You whisper in my ear that you are ready to feel me
I waste no time because I'm ready to feel you to
A lovely feel of wetness and warmth as I slide into you
As we engage in this overwhelming love making
I hope you know my body is yours for the taking
our minds escapes this physical world to a place all of our own
We try all the position our little nympho minds can ponder
We are dripping wet so full of sweat
You have climaxed many of times
Then you tell me your ready for mines
Not wanted this to stop but I feel I have no choice
I feel you shiver and I join in the fun and now were done
Slowly this saga has come to a end
I hold you tight as we drift off to sleep
I tell you I love you and kiss you good night...

Ripe for sentimental scenes,
Has picked a gangling unripe male,
Sees herself in bridal veil,
Presses lips and tosses head,
Declares she's not too young to wed,
Informs you pertly you forget
Romeo and Juliet.
Do not argue, do not shout;
Remind her how that one turned out."
593,Emotion,RomanticPoemsAFunOfRomanticPleasurePoembyRameshTA,"Fun of passionate enjoyment of romantic pleasure between
Two beautifully attractive souls is a great fortune for
Them to experience in the life of human world quite rare!
It's a great blessing only rare personalities of good heart
Have in this world full of doubts, taboos and conventions
That prevent two good hearts to live in romantic enjoyment!
Loving life so in romantic pleasure in fun for a brief period
Or a longtime sure here is not in one's hand, but if that
Happens naturally, it is a great boon bestowed on them by God!
The creator of humans decrees all live according to His will;
Love, romance, pleasure and peace are not for all to have in
Life except by the chosen few who have had deep faith in God!
For the ones who are in love of the Universal spiritual energy,
All in world and Nature, perhaps God bestows such a boon indeed!"

Longing for love they do all to get the hand of sweet heart;
Love, marriages and divorces and love again they try ever!
For the satisfaction of the self they do romance forever here
And live alone ever in life longing for love till the end comes.
Romantic fellows lament about the friends and loves lost in life;
Beginning, middle and end the means followed never the same
Because adventure is the spice and taste of romantic life here;
Many yet live romantic life because the pleasure is exotic ever!
A romantic life is the dream of many a guy and girl since long
Though success is rare failures they are ready to face and die!"

599,Emotion,RomanticPoemsARomanticTranslatedPoembyRGBell,"A Romantic (Translated)
You can see the house, or what was
A house, there, in the field that was a field
When rail, not barbed-wire fences made it one.
I suppose there's hardly one plank nailed
To another now, but picture it a house.
(Yes, there are the decaying remains of a
shack in the field he speaks of.)
If you ask about these parts you may yet find
A few who know the names of those who built
The place to keep fire in and water out.
(No, the last man who knew the family's
name died, with tubes in his nose and arms,
in a nursing home eight years ago without
thinking the knowledge worth passing on.)
The husband abandoned the city's complications
And brought his bride west to find a simpler way.
(He fled creditors and maintained a low
profile in the wilderness.)
She, though not comely, was beautiful
In her devotion, and followed without question.
(She was scarred by a pox and never lived
to be as old as she looked.  When the move
came she cried for weeks, but would not
compound the fault of marrying a no-good
by leaving him.)
In their new woodland home their love
(his lack of other diversion)
brought forth six strong children
(And four miscarriages and two who died
in their first year)
who early on learned
The simple ways of their parents, the hearth
And field being classrooms for all
They would ever know of life, or need to know.
(They were all put to work at the age of three
and couldn't be spared for school.)
They were raised with strictness tempered with love,
And taught right from wrong by a firm hand.
(If their father loved them he never said it,
but when drunk would reward a perceived wrong
with a strap.  Cost one boy an eye.)
And as they became men and women
Each in his own time set out on his own.
(As the father was bent and old by forty and
began losing his grip, they left.  Two in
one night, together, without a word.)
To find lives much like their elders had found.
(Only one of them lived past forty-eight.)
Their descendants, numerous in the area today,
Look back on them with reverence and wonder.
(There are in dresser drawers scattered about the
county, unidentified pictures of people
thought to have been kin.)"
600,Emotion,GirlPoemsTheGirlInsidePoembyMichelleGuza,"the girl inside has a fear,
of what the girl inside holds so dear,
far from reality, but always in dream,
the girl inside is screaming althought it may not seem,
it grows louder and louder everyday,
just wondering why the feeling just wouldnt stay,
the girl inside more then ever wants to run,
just wanting to tell everyone that she is done,
the girl inside feels sick all over,
in her head she feels so drunk,
she just cant seem to shake this phunk,
the girl inside just wants to die,
even when the girl out side wond dare to cry,
the girl inside has a fear,
of what the girl inside holds so dear,
but the girl outside just wont let it near! ! !"
601,Emotion,GirlPoemsTheWhistlingGirlPoembyDorothyParker,"Back of my back, they talk of me,
Gabble and honk and hiss;
Let them batten, and let them be-
Me, I can sing them this:
""Better to shiver beneath the stars,
Head on a faithless breast,
Than peer at the night through rusted bars,
And share an irksome rest.
""Better to see the dawn come up,
Along of a trifling one,
Than set a steady man's cloth and cup
And pray the day be done.
""Better be left by twenty dears
Than lie in a loveless bed;
Better a loaf that's wet with tears
Than cold, unsalted bread.""
Back of my back, they wag their chins,
Whinny and bleat and sigh;
But better a heart a-bloom with sins
Than hearts gone yellow and dry!"
602,Emotion,GirlPoemsACrazedGirlPoembyWilliamButlerYeats,"THAT crazed girl improvising her music.
Her poetry, dancing upon the shore,
Her soul in division from itself
Climbing, falling She knew not where,
Hiding amid the cargo of a steamship,
Her knee-cap broken, that girl I declare
A beautiful lofty thing, or a thing
Heroically lost, heroically found.
No matter what disaster occurred
She stood in desperate music wound,
Wound, wound, and she made in her triumph
Where the bales and the baskets lay
No common intelligible sound
But sang, 'O sea-starved, hungry sea.'"
603,Emotion,GirlPoemsAGreekGirlPoembyAmyLevy,"I may not weep, not weep, and he is dead.
A weary, weary weight of tears unshed
Through the long day in my sad heart I bear;
The horrid sun with all unpitying glare
Shines down into the dreary weaving-room,
Where clangs the ceaseless clatter of the loom,
And ceaselessly deft maiden-fingers weave
The fine-wrought web; and I from morn till eve
Work with the rest, and when folk speak to me
I smile hard smiles; while still continually
The silly stream of maiden speech flows on:--
And now at length they talk of him that's gone,
Lightly lamenting that he died so soon--
Ah me! ere yet his life's sun stood at noon.
Some praise his eyes, some deem his body fair,
And some mislike the colour of his hair!
Sweet life, sweet shape, sweet eyes, and sweetest hair,
What form, what hue, save Love's own, did ye wear?
I may not weep, not weep, for very shame.
He loved me not. One summer's eve he came
To these our halls, my father's honoured guest,
And seeing me, saw not. If his lips had prest
My lips, but once, in love; his eyes had sent
One love-glance into mine, I had been content,
And deemed it great joy for one little life;
Nor envied other maids the crown of wife:
The long sure years, the merry children-band--
Alas, alas, I never touched his hand!
And now my love is dead that loved not me.
Thrice-blest, thrice-crowned, of gods thrice-lovèd she--
That other, fairer maid, who tombward brings
Her gold, shorn locks and piled-up offerings
Of fragrant fruits, rich wines, and spices rare,
And cakes with honey sweet, with saffron fair;
And who, unchecked by any thought of shame,
May weep her tears, and call upon his name,
With burning bosom prest to the cold ground,
Knowing, indeed, that all her life is crown'd,
Thrice-crowned, thrice honoured, with that love of his;--
No dearer crown on earth is there, I wis.
While yet the sweet life lived, more light to bear
Was my heart's hunger; when the morn was fair,
And I with other maidens in a line
Passed singing through the city to the shrine,
Oft in the streets or crowded market-place
I caught swift glimpses of the dear-known face;
Or marked a stalwart shoulder in the throng;
Or heard stray speeches as we passed along,
In tones more dear to me than any song.
These, hoarded up with care, and kept apart,
Did serve as meat and drink my hungry heart.
And now for ever has my sweet love gone;
And weary, empty days I must drag on,
Till all the days of all my life be sped,
By no thought cheered, by no hope comforted.
For if indeed we meet among the shades,
How shall he know me from the other maids?--
Me, that had died to save his body pain!
Alas, alas, such idle thoughts are vain!
O cruel, cruel sunlight, get thee gone!
O dear, dim shades of eve, come swiftly on!
That when quick lips, keen eyes, are closed in sleep,
Through the long night till dawn I then may weep."
604,Emotion,GirlPoemsALetterFromAGirlToHerOwnOldAgePoembyAliceMeynell,"Listen, and when thy hand this paper presses,
O time-worn woman, think of her who blesses
What thy thin fingers touch, with her caresses.
O mother, for the weight of years that break thee!
O daughter, for slow time must yet awake thee,
And from the changes of my heart must make thee!
O fainting traveller, morn is gray in heaven.
Dost thou remember how the clouds were driven?
And are they calm about the fall of even?
Pause near the ending of thy long migration;
For this one sudden hour of desolation
Appeals to one hour of thy meditation.
Suffer, O silent one, that I remind thee
Of the great hills that stormed the sky behind thee,
Of the wild winds of power that have resigned thee.
Know that the mournful plain where thou must wander
Is but a gray and silent world, but ponder
The misty mountains of the morning yonder.
Listen:-the mountain winds with rain were fretting,
And sudden gleams the mountain-tops besetting.
I cannot let thee fade to death, forgetting.
What part of this wild heart of mine I know not
Will follow with thee where the great winds blow not,
And where the young flowers of the mountain grow not.
Yet let my letter with thy lost thoughts in it
Tell what the way was when thou didst begin it,
And win with thee the goal when thou shalt win it.
I have not writ this letter of divining
To make a glory of thy silent pining,
A triumph of thy mute and strange declining.
Only one youth, and the bright life was shrouded;
Only one morning, and the day was clouded;
And one old age with all regrets is crowded.
O hush, O hush! Thy tears my words are steeping.
O hush, hush, hush! So full, the fount of weeping?
Poor eyes, so quickly moved, so near to sleeping?
Pardon the girl; such strange desires beset her.
Poor woman, lay aside the mournful letter
That breaks thy heart; the one who wrote, forget her:
The one who now thy faded features guesses,
With filial fingers thy gray hair caresses,
With morning tears thy mournful twilight blesses."
605,Emotion,GirlPoemsSweetestGirlPoembysamcorruptSfinley,"You’re the sweetest girl I ever met
Beautiful eyes like a rising sunset
A face as stunning as an angels glow
Her elegant heart as pure as her soul
A smile that could cheer up a sad man
Gentle hands there to help you stand
Angelic feathers fall whenever she goes
She’s a holy angel that has a cute nose
Long hair shining like the moon light
Her voice displays rhythm and might
A body that has committed no crimes
Reminisces of the sad and happy times
Never lets the world around get her down
She never lets her a smile turn into a frown

But she still remains the sweetest girl I ever met"

How can Lyca sleep.

While the beasts of prey,
Come from caverns deep,
View'd the maid asleep
The kingly lion stood
And the virgin view'd:
Then he gambolled round
O'er the hallowed ground:
Leopards, tygers play,
Round her as she lay;
While the lion old,
Bow'd his mane of gold,
And her bosom lick,

From his eyes of flame,

Now, pointlessly silent, you don’t seem to be
idle of nights, it’s proclaimed by your bed
garlanded, fragrant with Syrian perfume,
squashed cushions and pillows, here and there,
and the trembling frame shaken,
quivering and wandering about.
But being silent does nothing for you.
Why? Spread thighs blab it’s not so,

She has a beauty of her own,
A beauty of a paler tone
Than English belles;
Yet southern sun and southern air
Have kissed her cheeks, until they wear
The dainty tints that oft appear
On rosy shells.
Her frank, clear eyes bespeak a mind
Old-world traditions fail to bind.
She is not shy
Or bold, but simply self-possessed;
Her independence adds a zest
Unto her speech, her piquant jest,
Her quaint reply.
O'er classic volumes she will pore
With joy; and true scholastic lore
Will often gain.
In sports she bears away the bell,
Nor, under music's siren spell,
To dance divinely, flirt as well,
Does she disdain."

Seem'd o'er the waves to go !
The livid flash illum'd the clam'rous main,
While ZELMA pour'd, unmark'd, her melancholy strain.
IV.
""Be still!"" she cried, ""loud tempest cease!
""O ! spare the gallant souls:
""The thunder rolls--the winds increase--
""The Sea, like mountains, rolls!
""While, from the deck, the storm worn victims leap,
""And o'er their struggling limbs, the furious billows sweep.
V.
""O! barb'rous Pow'r! relentless Fate!
""Does Heav'n's high will decree
""That some should sleep on beds of state,--
""Some, in the roaring Sea ?
""Some, nurs'd in splendour, deal Oppression's blow,
""While worth and DRACO pine--in Slavery and woe!
VI.
""Yon Vessel oft has plough'd the main
""With human traffic fraught;
""Its cargo,--our dark Sons of pain--
""For worldly treasure bought !
""What had they done?--O Nature tell me why--
""Is taunting scorn the lot, of thy dark progeny?
VII.
""Thou gav'st, in thy caprice, the Soul
""Peculiarly enshrin'd;
""Nor from the ebon Casket stole
""The Jewel of the mind!
""Then wherefore let the suff'ring Negro's breast
""Bow to his fellow, MAN, in brighter colours drest.
VIII.
""Is it the dim and glossy hue
""That marks him for despair?--
""While men with blood their hands embrue,
""And mock the wretch's pray'r?
""Shall guiltless Slaves the Scourge of tyrants feel,
""And, e'en before their GOD ! unheard, unpitied kneel.
IX.
""Could the proud rulers of the land
""Our Sable race behold;
""Some bow'd by torture's Giant hand
""And others, basely sold !
""Then would they pity Slaves, and cry, with shame,
""Whate'er their TINTS may be, their SOULS are still the same!
X.
""Why seek to mock the Ethiop's face?
""Why goad our hapless kind?
""Can features alienate the race--
""Is there no kindred mind?
""Does not the cheek which vaunts the roseate hue
""Oft blush for crimes, that Ethiops never knew?
XI.
""Behold ! the angry waves conspire
""To check the barb'rous toil!
""While wounded Nature's vengeful ire--
""Roars, round this trembling Isle!
""And hark ! her voice re-echoes in the wind--
""Man was not form'd by Heav'n, to trample on his kind!
XII.
""Torn from my Mother's aching breast,
""My Tyrant sought my love--
""But, in the Grave shall ZELMA rest,
""E'er she will faithless prove--
""No DRACO!--Thy companion I will be
""To that celestial realm, where Negros shall be free!
XIII.
""The Tyrant WHITE MAN taught my mind--
""The letter'd page to trace;--
""He taught me in the Soul to find
""No tint, as in the face:
""He bade my Reason, blossom like the tree--
""But fond affection gave, the ripen'd fruits to thee.
XIV.
""With jealous rage he mark'd my love
""He sent thee far away;--
""And prison'd in the plantain grove--
""Poor ZELMA pass'd the day--
""But ere the moon rose high above the main,
""ZELMA, and Love contriv'd, to break the Tyrant's chain.
XV.
""Swift, o'er the plain of burning Sand
""My course I bent to thee;
""And soon I reach'd the billowy strand
""Which bounds the stormy Sea.--
""DRACO! my Love! Oh yet, thy ZELMA'S soul
""Springs ardently to thee,--impatient of controul.
XVI.
""Again the lightning flashes white--
""The rattling cords among!
""Now, by the transient vivid light,
""I mark the frantic throng!
""Now up the tatter'd shrouds my DRACO flies--
While o'er the plunging prow, the curling billows rise.
XVII.
""The topmast falls--three shackled slaves--
""Cling to the Vessel's side!
""Now lost amid the madd'ning waves--
""Now on the mast they ride--
""See ! on the forecastle my DRACO stands
""And now he waves his chain, now clasps his bleeding hands.
XVIII.
""Why, cruel WHITE-MAN! when away
""My sable Love was torn,
""Why did you let poor ZELMA stay,
On Afric's sands to mourn?
""No ! ZELMA is not left, for she will prove
""In the deep troubled main, her fond--her faithful LOVE.""
XIX.
The lab'ring Ship was now a wreck,
The shrouds were flutt'ring wide!
The rudder gone, the lofty deck
Was rock'd from side to side--
Poor ZELMA'S eyes now dropp'd their last big tear,
While, from her tawny cheek, the blood recoil'd with fear.
XX.
Now frantic, on the sands she roam'd,
Now shrieking stop'd to view
Where high the liquid mountains foam'd,
Around the exhausted crew--
'Till, from the deck, her DRACO'S well known form
Sprung mid the yawning waves, and buffetted the Storm.
XXI.
Long, on the swelling surge sustain'd
Brave DRACO sought the shore,
Watch'd the dark Maid, but ne'er complain'd,
Then sunk, to gaze no more!
Poor ZELMA saw him buried by the wave--
And, with her heart's true Love, plung'd in a wat'ry grave."
612,Emotion,GirlPoemsHomeTruthsForVarussGirlToVarusPoembyGaiusValeriusCatullus,"Varus drags me into his affairs
out of the Forum, where I’m seen idling:
to a little whore I immediately saw,
not very inelegant, not unattractive,
who, when we came there, met us
with varied chatter, including, how might
Bithynia stand now, what’s it like, and where
might the benefit have been to me in cash.
I told her what’s true, nothing at all,
while neither the praetors nor their aides,
return any the richer, especially since
our Praetor, Memmius, the bugger,
cared not a jot for his followers.
‘But surely,’ they said, you could have bought
slaves they say are made for the litter there.’
I, so the girl might take me to be wealthy,
said ‘no, for me things weren’t so bad,
that coming across one bad province,
I couldn’t buy eight good men.’
But I’d no one, neither here nor there,
who might even raise to his shoulder
the shattered foot of an old couch.
At this she, like the shameless thing she was, said
‘I beg you, my dear Catullus, for the loan of them,
just for a while: I’d like to be carried
to Serap’s temple.’ ‘Wait’ I said to the girl,
‘what I just said was mine, isn’t actually in
my possession: my friend Cinna, that’s Gaius,
purchased the thing for himself.
Whether they’re his or mine, what difference to me?
I use them just as well as if I’d bought them myself.
But you are quite tasteless, and annoying,
you with whom no inexactness is allowed.’"
613,Emotion,GirlPoemsDeathOfASoulMateDeathOfTheGirlPoembyLilyEspinosa,"Her hero's gone away,
Will he come back another day?
She could not say.
She let her soul mate run away,
And something inside of her died.
'Now I don't want to come out and play',
The little girl cried.
Left all alone in such a big world,
He is not there to protect her,
No longer will he make her feel safe
In his warm embrace.
He used to love her but things have changed,
The girl is alone.
She let her soul mate escape,
Her insides hollow, the girl is left opaque."
614,Emotion,GirlPoemsYesYouGirlPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"So, watch this space
there will be more,
and, just in case
others adore
the one who is

in this small quiz
her luscious whole.
I shall reveal
in time that's due.
I broke the seal
only for you."
615,Emotion,GirlPoemsToASadGirlPoembyUriahHamilton,"There is no way to explain
Unending sorrow and grief,
No way to kiss a young girl’s cheek
In a way that would give her back
The joy death has stolen.
Humans are brave enough
To live and bleed and die,
But to be the one remaining
As others say goodbye
Is too much to withstand.
There are evil stars that smirk
And thus mark us for treacherous fates,
The days all burn like desert fields
Until there is nothing left to love
And nothing left to feel."
616,Emotion,GirlPoemsDarkGirlPoembyUriahHamilton,"One day,
Dogs will laugh
In the streets,
And we’ll kiss wildly
Like lunatics
Escaping the asylum.
You’re a dark girl
So I’m painting
My roses black,
And I’ll murder the sun
If he ever turns his back.
I would rather
Enter the palace of your pain
Than continue to exist
In the prison cell of my loneliness."
617,Emotion,GirlPoemsTheHalfBreedGirlPoembyDuncanCampbellScott,"She is free of the trap and the paddle,
The portage and the trail,
But something behind her savage life
Shines like a fragile veil.
Her dreams are undiscovered,
Shadows trouble her breast,
When the time for resting cometh
Then least is she at rest.
Oft in the morns of winter,
When she visits the rabbit snares,
An appearance floats in the crystal air
Beyond the balsam firs.
Oft in the summer mornings
When she strips the nets of fish,
The smell of the dripping net-twine
Gives to her heart a wish.
But she cannot learn the meaning
Of the shadows in her soul,
The lights that break and gather,
The clouds that part and roll,
The reek of rock-built cities,
Where her fathers dwelt of yore,
The gleam of loch and shealing,
The mist on the moor,
Frail traces of kindred kindness,
Of feud by hill and strand,
The heritage of an age-long life
In a legendary land.
She wakes in the stifling wigwam,
Where the air is heavy and wild,
She fears for something or nothing
With the heart of a frightened child.
She sees the stars turn slowly
Past the tangle of the poles,
Through the smoke of the dying embers,
Like the eyes of dead souls.
Her heart is shaken with longing
For the strange, still years,
For what she knows and knows not,
For the wells of ancient tears.
A voice calls from the rapids,
Deep, careless and free,
A voice that is larger than her life
Or than her death shall be.
She covers her face with her blanket,
Her fierce soul hates her breath,
As it cries with a sudden passion
For life or death."
618,Emotion,GirlPoemsThePeriwinkleGirlPoembyWilliamSchwenckGilbert,"I've often thought that headstrong youths
Of decent education,
Determine all-important truths,
With strange precipitation.
The ever-ready victims they,
Of logical illusions,
And in a self-assertive way
They jump at strange conclusions.
Now take my case:  Ere sorrow could
My ample forehead wrinkle,
I had determined that I should
Not care to be a winkle.
""A winkle,"" I would oft advance
With readiness provoking,
""Can seldom flirt, and never dance,
Or soothe his mind by smoking.""
In short, I spurned the shelly joy,
And spoke with strange decision -
Men pointed to me as a boy
Who held them in derision.
But I was young - too young, by far -
Or I had been more wary,
I knew not then that winkles are
The stock-in-trade of MARY.
I had not watched her sunlight blithe
As o'er their shells it dances -
I've seen those winkles almost writhe
Beneath her beaming glances.
Of slighting all the winkly brood
I surely had been chary,
If I had known they formed the food
And stock-in-trade of MARY.
Both high and low and great and small
Fell prostrate at her tootsies,
They all were noblemen, and all
Had balances at COUTTS'S.
Dukes with the lovely maiden dealt,
DUKE BAILEY and DUKE HUMPHY,
Who ate her winkles till they felt
Exceedingly uncomfy.
DUKE BAILEY greatest wealth computes,
And sticks, they say, at no-thing,
He wears a pair of golden boots
And silver underclothing.
DUKE HUMPHY, as I understand,
Though mentally acuter,
His boots are only silver, and
His underclothing pewter.
A third adorer had the girl,
A man of lowly station -
A miserable grov'ling Earl
Besought her approbation.
This humble cad she did refuse
With much contempt and loathing,
He wore a pair of leather shoes
And cambric underclothing!
""Ha! ha!"" she cried.  ""Upon my word!
Well, really - come, I never!
Oh, go along, it's too absurd!
My goodness!  Did you ever?
""Two Dukes would Mary make a bride,
And from her foes defend her"" -
""Well, not exactly that,"" they cried,
""We offer guilty splendour.
""We do not offer marriage rite,
So please dismiss the notion!""
""Oh dear,"" said she, ""that alters quite
The state of my emotion.""
The Earl he up and says, says he,
""Dismiss them to their orgies,
For I am game to marry thee
Quite reg'lar at St. George's.""
(He'd had, it happily befell,
A decent education,
His views would have befitted well
A far superior station.)
His sterling worth had worked a cure,
She never heard him grumble;
She saw his soul was good and pure,
Although his rank was humble.
Her views of earldoms and their lot,
All underwent expansion -
Come, Virtue in an earldom's cot!
Go, Vice in ducal mansion!"

But comes on foot, a goose-girl still.
And all the loveliest things there be
Come simply, so, it seems to me.
If ever I said, in grief or pride,
I tired of honest things, I lied:
And should be cursed forevermore
With Love in laces, like a whore,
And neighbours cold, and friends unsteady,
And Spring on horseback, like a lady!"
620,Emotion,GirlPoemsCookieGirlPoembyVictorOsorio,"Thank you--she is my friend
It's a rare positive
She cares like a sister would
I'm also there for her
Like a big brother should
She makes me laugh
At times when I want to be alone
She feels my pain
Because we come from the same home
It's nice to know someone like this
She's moving away soon
Her cookie girl ways, I will miss
We both lost friends along the way
We're both losers, as people would say
Someone once told me
Things happen for a reason
She deserves the best
I'm just a friend, but not like the rest
Theres a bond we could see
Only cookie girl really understands me."

623,Emotion,GirlPoemsGirlInCemetryPoembyDeepaThomas,"Alone in that desolate cemetery
Not a single soul around
Near the grave with a marble angel
Laden with a bunch of roses
Whose tombstone proclaimed
“He was a loving son and brother,
Now, up in Heaven to spread joy”
In the golden letters on white marble
She sat, head bend in silence
A single tear in her eyes
Glistening in the summer sun
Loosing count of passing time
Seconds turning to minutes and hours
Incognizant of the world around
What did she tell him wordlessly?
May be, how much she loved him
May be, how much she miss him
Or may be she questioned
Why he left her all alone?
Why can’t he come back?
Will this world ever want to know
What he was in this world
Other than being a son or brother
What did he meant to her
May be she asked God too
A few of her unanswered questions
Will the world see his wish
To share his world with her
To walk down that church aisle
With her beside him
Hand in hand n’ pride in eyes
To be her knight in shining armour
May be in another world
May be in another life! !"
624,Emotion,GirlPoemsTheLittleGirlFoundPoembyWilliamBlake,"All the night in woe,
Lyca's parents go:
Over vallies deep.
While the desarts weep.
Tired and woe-begone.
Hoarse with making moan:
Arm in arm seven days.
They trac'd the desert ways.
Seven nights they sleep.
Among shadows deep:
And dream they see their child
Starvdd in desart wild.
Pale thro' pathless ways
The fancied image strays.
Famish'd, weeping, weak
With hollow piteous shriek
Rising from unrest,
The trembling woman prest,
With feet of weary woe;
She could no further go.
In his arms he bore.
Her arm'd with sorrow sore:
Till before their way
A couching lion lay.
Turning back was vain,
Soon his heavy mane.
Bore them to the ground;
Then he stalk'd around.
Smelling to his prey,
But their fears allay,
When he licks their hands:
And silent by them stands.
They look upon his eyes
Fill'd with deep surprise:
And wondering behold.
A spirit arm'd in gold.
On his head a crown
On his shoulders down,
Flow'd his golden hair.
Gone was all their care.
Follow me he said,
Weep not for the maid;
In my palace deep.
Lyca lies asleep.
Then they followed,
Where the vision led;
And saw their sleeping child,
Among tygers wild.
To this day they dwell
In a lonely dell
Nor fear the wolvish howl,
Nor the lion's growl."
625,Emotion,GirlPoemsALittleGirlLostPoembyWilliamBlake,"Children of the future age,
Reading this indignant page,
Know that in a former time
Love, sweet love, was thought a crime.
In the age of gold,
Free from winter's cold,
Youth and maiden bright,
To the holy light,
Naked in the sunny beams delight.
Once a youthful pair,
Filled with softest care,
Met in garden bright
Where the holy light
Had just removed the curtains of the night.
Then, in rising day,
On the grass they play;
Parents were afar,
Strangers came not near,
And the maiden soon forgot her fear.
Tired with kisses sweet,
They agree to meet
When the silent sleep
Waves o'er heaven's deep,
And the weary tired wanderers weep.
To her father white
Came the maiden bright;
But his loving look,
Like the holy book
All her tender limbs with terror shook.
'Ona, pale and weak,
To thy father speak!
Oh the trembling fear!
Oh the dismal care
That shakes the blossoms of my hoary hair!'"
626,Emotion,GirlPoemsAGirlWithBlueGreenHairPoembyMaryRyan,"One Sunday morning I hurried on my way
And I arrived at my church ready to worship and pray
Then I saw a girl with blue-green hair
She walked away, not welcome there
I could see the tears falling down her face
I realized that I didn’t want to be in such a place
I looked at myself in my dress so neat
And then at the girl in her jeans and dusty bare feet
“Don’t be sad because you were turned away
We’ll find us a church where we both can stay”
With a smile on my face, I took her hand
And we both walked away from my church so grand
Soon a small wooden building I chanced to see
A young man smiled and greeted both her and me
The doors I saw were thrown open wide
“There’s a place for you both just right inside”
So many different people all worshipping the Lord
And the truth being preached straight from His Word
A place was found for us side by side
Welcomed by His love that we often hide
Let all church doors be thrown open wide
And all who approach be welcomed inside
Whether it be a woman with a refined air
Or a barefoot girl with blue-green hair"

Washington at the head of the army,

Anticipate when the thirty or fifty millions, are to become the
hundred, or two hundred millions, of equal freemen and
freewomen, amicably joined.
Recall ages--One age is but a part--ages are but a part;
The eternal equilibrium of things is great, and the eternal overthrow
of things is great,
And there is another paradox.
Recall the angers, bickerings, delusions, superstitions, of the idea
of caste,
Recall the bloody cruelties and crimes.

spread through all These States,
I say a girl fit for These States must be free, capable, dauntless,
just the same as a boy.

The coarseness of my por attire;
The fair moon mounts, and aye the flame
Of Gypsy beauty blazes higher.
Pale Northern girls! you scorn our race;
You captives of your air-tight halls,
Wear out in-doors your sickly days,
But leave us the horizon walls.
And if I take you, dames, to task,
And say it frankly without guile,
Then you are Gypsies in a mask,
And I the lady all the while.
If, on the heath, below the moon,
I court and play with paler blood,
Me false to mine dare whisper none,--
One sallow horseman knows me good.
Go, keep your cheek's rose from the rain,
For teeth and hair with shopmen deal;
My swarthy tint is in the grain,
The rocks and forest knoww it real.
The wild air bloweth in out lungs,
The keen stars twinkle in our eyes,
The birds gave us our wily tongues,
The panther in our dances flies.

But without glass we fathom you."

Designed your mask, he wrought with cunning fist,
And made a mouth expressly to be kiss'd -
Not for shrill utterance nor pert grimaces.
The curved, ripe lips-above the rounded chin -
He dyed the hue of summer's reddest rose,
Then placed a smile upon them to disclose
A glimpse of white and even pearls within.
Those lips are silent, sweetheart! - but your eyes
Are eloquent, and they love's lesson teach
Better than other woman's aptest speech -
In their soft light the tend'rest language lies.
In womankind - the world has long confess'd -
A silent mouth and speaking eyes are best."
631,Emotion,GirlPoemsToALittleGirlThatHasToldALiePoembyAnnTaylor,"AND has my darling told a lie?
Did she forget that GOD was by?
That GOD, who saw the things she did,
From whom no action can be hid;
Did she forget that GOD could see
And hear, wherever she might be?
He made your eyes, and can discern
Whichever way you think to turn;
He made your ears, and he can hear
When you think nobody is near;
In every place, by night or day,
He watches all you do and say.
Oh, how I wish you would but try
To act, as shall not need a lie;
And when you wish a thing to do,
That has been once forbidden you,
Remember that, nor ever dare
To disobey­, for GOD is there.
Why should you fear the truth to tell?
Does falsehood ever do so well?
Can you be satisfied to know,
There's something wrong to hide below?
No! let your fault be what it may,
To own it is the happy way.
So long as you your crime conceal,
You cannot light and gladsome feel:
Your little heart will seem oppress'd,
As if a weight were on your breast;
And e'en your mother's eye to meet,
Will tinge your face with shame and heat.
Yes, GOD has made your duty clear,
By every blush, by every fear;
And conscience, like an angel kind,
Keeps watch to bring it to your mind:
Its friendly warnings ever heed,
And neither tell a lie­ nor need."

she liked to sit outside at night and talk to the moon.
everynight she kept the moon company.
one night she noticed the moon seemed tired, so
she climbed upon the roof, to tell the moon a secret.
the old moon smiled, so she reaches up
takes the moon in her hands and puts him in her pocket.
then she climbs down and goes into her house, up the stairs
to her room.there she takes the moon out and lets lay on
her bed.for hours they talked, told secrets and giggled.
then they heard people asking where the moon was.
outside was so dark, they couldnt find their ways.
the old moon says to the little girl
'maybe you should put me back into the sky,
so the people can find their way home at night'.
the little girl agreed.so she picks up the moon,
puts him back into her pocket.
she walks downstairs and goes outside.
it was very dark, but she wasnt afraid,
she had her friend the moon to help
show her the way.
she climbs back upon the roof, takes the moon out
of her pocket. holding him with both hands
she tells the moon'i love you,
we will still talk every night, but you must go back
give people light at nightime'.
she leans over kisses the moon goodnight.
then reaches back and tosses the moon
hard as she could back into the
nightime sky.
then the little girl and the moon hear, all the people
shouting and laughing.
after everything quietened down
the stars who were so happy the moon returned
all gave the moon kisses.
the little girl climbed down
with the moon lighting her way
went inside up to her room
took 1 last peek out

633,Emotion,GirlPoemsASullenGirlPoembyUriahHamilton,"I quietly walk immense, lonely streets
And think of a sullen girl
Whose eyes were always
Watery and sad,
Even in the absence of tears.
I recall once having held her hand
In the sunlight amid yellow flowers
And wanting to whisper something to her
That would make her smile
And forget her tragic soul
For a fleeting moment.
Some girls dress in black
And you can’t reach them with romance,
But you fall in love with them nonetheless;
The poetry of their melancholy eyes
Slips into your psyche
Like a recurring childhood dream.
She eventually gets lost somewhere
And drifts away, she finds it impossible to linger
With one man and be understood.
You think, perhaps this is best,
She’s not for you,
But your life becomes morose,
Her disconsolate mood has infected you
And you begin to view the world
Through the same saturnine eyes.
In your solitude, you question why
The two of you could not remain
Unhappy together?"

Tender as dew, impetuous as rain,
The tan of the sun will be on your skin,
The purr of the breeze in your murmuring speech,
You will pose with a hill-flower grace.
You will come, with your slim, expressive arms,
A poise of the head no sculptor has caught
And nuances spoken with shoulder and neck,
Your face in a pass-and-repass of moods
As many as skies in delicate change
Of cloud and blue and flimmering sun.
Yet,
You may not come, O girl of a dream,
We may but pass as the world goes by
And take from a look of eyes into eyes,
A film of hope and a memoried day."

Of snippets of sunshine and apples of air.

And away with a shout and a shake of the head;
I’ll pick you a pearl from the pigeon-pink pool
Where cuddles and kisses are going to bed,
Away, come away To the lands of the fay,
For the afternoon tinkles your lassie-love’s lay.
Play truant with Time, and while Age is asleep
I’ll give you the heart of my girlhood to keep."
636,Emotion,GirlPoemsTheFactoryGirlPoembyJohnArthurPhillips,"She wasn't the least bit pretty,
And only the least bit gay;
And she walked with a firm elastic tread,
In a business-like kind of way.
Her dress was of coarse, brown woollen,
Plainly but neatly made,
Trimmed with some common ribbon
Or cheaper kind of braid;
And a hat with a broken feather,
And shawl of a modest plaid.
Her face seemed worn and weary,
And traced with lines of care,
As her nut-brown tresses blew aside
In the keen December air;
Yet she was not old, scarce twenty,
And her form was full and sleek,
But her heavy eye, and tired step,
Seemed of wearisome toil to speak;
She worked as a common factory girl
For two dollars and a half a week.
Ten hours a day of labor
In a close, ill-lighted room;
Machinery's buzz for music,
Waste gas for sweet perfume;
Hot stifling vapors in summer,
Chill draughts on a winter's day,
No pause for rest or pleasure
On pain of being sent away;
So ran her civilized serfdom --
Four cents an hour the pay.
""A fair day's work,"" say the masters,
And ""a fair day's pay,"" say the men;
There's a strike -- a rise in wages,
What effect to the poor girl then?
A harder struggle than ever
The honest path to keep;
And so sink a little lower,
Some humbler home to seek;
For living is dearer -- her wages,
Two dollars and a half a week.
A man gets thrice the money,
But then ""a man's a man,
""And a woman surely can't expect
""To earn as much as he can.""
Of his hire the laborer's worthy,
Be that laborer who it may;
If a woman can do a man's work
She should have a man's full pay,
Not to be left to starve -- or sin --
On forty cents a day.
Two dollars and a half to live on,
Or starve on, if you will;
Two dollars and a half to dress on,
And a hungry mouth to fill;
Two dollars and a half to lodge on
In some wretched hole or den,
Where crowds are huddled together,
Girls, and women, and men;
If she sins to escape her bondage
Is there room for wonder then."
637,Emotion,GirlPoemsAlwaysMarryAnAprilGirlPoembyOgdenNash,"Praise the spells and bless the charms,
I found April in my arms.
April golden, April cloudy,
Gracious, cruel, tender, rowdy;
April soft in flowered languor,
April cold with sudden anger,
Ever changing, ever true --
I love April, I love you."
638,Emotion,GirlPoemsForANaughtyLittleGirlPoembyAnnTaylor,"My sweet little girl should be cheerful and mild
She must not be fretful and cry!
Oh! why is this passion? remember, my child,
GOD sees you, who lives in the sky.
That dear little face, that I like so to kiss,
How alter'd and sad it appears!
Do you think I can love you so naughty as this,
Or kiss you, all wetted with tears?
Remember, though GOD is in Heaven, my love,
He sees you within and without,
And always looks down, from His glory above,
To notice what you are about.
If I am not with you, or if it be dark,
And nobody is in the way,
His eye is as able your doings to mark,
In the night as it is in the day.
Then dry up your tears and look smiling again,
And never do things that are wrong;
For I'm sure you must feel it a terrible pain,
To be naughty and crying so long.
We'll pray, then, that GOD may your passion forgive,
And teach you from evil to fly;
And then you'll be happy as long as you live,
And happy whenever you die."
639,Emotion,GirlPoemsDaddysLittleGirlPoembyLagayaEvans,"Always in my mind
I can see my daddy's face
As he took me in his arms
Enveloped me with his embrace
Daddy always held my hand
With that great big hand of his
Said, I was his little princess
Go ahead a make a wish
Many times I would fall down
And skin my knees
He would always come running
Oh, baby, let me see!
He told me when I grew up
I would be somebodies queen
But for now his little girl
The most prettiest he's ever seen
I would set in my daddy's lap
I felt I was on a thrown
Not knowing oh, to soon
I would be almost grown
My daddy's my hero
Someone I want to be
When I grow up daddy
I'll make you proud of me
I guess I'll always be
That little girl that needs her dad
I'll treasure every moment
Every memory that we have
Time can be so unkind
Live today but a memory tomorrow
I just want to stay daddy's little girl
If time we could only borrow
Memories flood my mind
Just like I was ten
Daddy can you play a game with me
He gently takes my chin
You'll always be my little girl
If only in our minds
Daddy, daddy you can't catch me
Your it,  It's your turn to hide
Daddy's are a gift from God
Made especially for little girls
I love you so much daddy
You are my great big world"

Living in the world a familier place.
I'm just a girl, with tears in her eyes.
Swimming in a pool of cold hearted lies.
I'm just a girl, always second best.
With sleepless nights and no time to rest
I'm just a girl, with scars all around.
Always screaming with out a sound
I'm juts a girl, giving up on life.
Running from my problems headed for the knife
I'm just a girl, who's messed up in the head.
With hope and wishes and prayers to be dead
I'm just a girl, with nothing to live for.
Who shut out the world and fell to the floor.
I'm just a girl, living in fear
In the dark lonely place, flooded with tears.
I'm just a girl, behind closed doors,
soon to be gone and live no more."

642,Emotion,GirlPoemsOnlyADancingGirlPoembyWilliamSchwenckGilbert,"Only a dancing girl,
With an unromantic style,
With borrowed colour and curl,
With fixed mechanical smile,
With many a hackneyed wile,
With ungrammatical lips,
And corns that mar her trips.
Hung from the ""flies"" in air,
She acts a palpable lie,
She's as little a fairy there
As unpoetical I!
I hear you asking, Why -
Why in the world I sing
This tawdry, tinselled thing?
No airy fairy she,
As she hangs in arsenic green
From a highly impossible tree
In a highly impossible scene
(Herself not over-clean).
For fays don't suffer, I'm told,
From bunions, coughs, or cold.
And stately dames that bring
Their daughters there to see,
Pronounce the ""dancing thing""
No better than she should be,
With her skirt at her shameful knee,
And her painted, tainted phiz:
Ah, matron, which of us is?
(And, in sooth, it oft occurs
That while these matrons sigh,
Their dresses are lower than hers,
And sometimes half as high;
And their hair is hair they buy,
And they use their glasses, too,
In a way she'd blush to do.)
But change her gold and green
For a coarse merino gown,
And see her upon the scene
Of her home, when coaxing down
Her drunken father's frown,
In his squalid cheerless den:
She's a fairy truly, then!"
643,Emotion,GirlPoemsComePrettySchoolGirlPoembyHenryClayWork,"On this rolling planet ever have you seen
A home so like a palace waiting for its queen? --
A dwelling place so fair,
So fill'd with treasures rare,
As the little white cottage on Evergreen Square?
Come, pretty school girl! lay your books aside;
Yes graduate tomorrow -- tomorrow be my bride;
My fortune share,
And reign queen there,
In the little white cottage on Evergreen Square.
Red as are the roses climbing on its wall,
Your cheeks of richer crimson shall out-bloom them all.
Your eyes (beyond compare)
A brighter gleam shall wear,
In the little white cottage on Everygreen Square.
Flow'rs of rarest fragrance all the year shall bloom,
And singing birds make music in your chosen room.
Come, breathe its balmy air!
Come, charm away my care,
In the little white cottage on Everygreen Square."
644,Emotion,GirlPoemsHisGippslandGirlPoembyWilliamHenryOgilvie,"Now, money was scarce and work was slack
And love to his heart Crept in,
And he rode away on the Northern track
To war with the world and win;
And he vowed by the locket upon his breast
And its treasure, one red gold curl,
To work with with a will in the fartherest West
For the sake of his Gippsland girl.
The hot wind blows on the dusty plain
And the red sun burns above,
But he sees her face at his side again,
And he strikes each blow for love.
He toils by the light of one far-off star
For the winning of one white pearl,
And the swinging pick and the driving bar
Strike home for the Gippsland girl.
With an aching wrist and a back that's bent,
With salt sweat blinding eyes,
'Tis little he'd reek if his life were spent
In the winning so grand a prize.
His shear blades flash and over his hand
The folds of the white fleece curl,
And all day long he sticks to his stand
For the love of his Gippsland girl.
When the shearing's done and the shed's cut out
On Barwon and Narran and Bree;
When the shearer mates with the rouseabout
And the Union man with the free;
When the doors of the shanty, open wide,
An uproarious welcome hurl,
He passes by on the other side
For the sake of his gippsland girl.
When summer lay brown on the Western Land
He rode once more to the South,
Athirst for the touch of a lily hand
And the kiss of a rosebud mouth;
And he sang the songs that shorten the way,
And he envied not king or earl,
And he spared not the spur in his dappled grey
For the sake of his Gippsland girl.
At the garden gate when the shadows fell
His hopes in the dusk lay dead;
'Nelli? Oh! Surely you heard that Nell
Is married a month' they said.
He spoke no word; with a dull, dumb pain
At his heart, and his brain awhirl
He turned his grey to the North again
For the sake of his Gippsland girl.
And he rung the board in a Paroo shed
By the sweat of his aching brow,
But he blued his cheque, for he grimly said,
'There is nothing to live for now.'
And out and away where the big floods start
And the Darling dust-showers swirl,
There's a drunken shearer who broke his heart
Over a Gippsland girl!

645,Emotion,GirlPoemsAGirlSangASongPoembyAleksandrAleksandrovichBlok,"A girl sang a song in the temple's chorus,
About men, tired in alien lands,
About the ships that left native shores,
And all who forgot their joy to the end.
Thus sang her clean voice, and flew up to the highness,
And sunbeams shined on her shoulder's white --
And everyone saw and heard from the darkness
The white and airy gown, singing in the light.
And all of them were sure, that joy would burst out:
The ships have arrived at their beach,
The people, in the land of the aliens tired,
Regaining their bearing, are happy and reach.
And sweet was her voice and the sun's beams around....
And only, by Caesar's Gates -- high on the vault,
The baby, versed into mysteries, mourned,
Because none of them will be ever returned."
646,Emotion,GirlPoemsGirlWhyDontYouDryThoseTearsPoembyRonellWarrenAlman,"Girl, why don't you dry those tears
You have so much to live for
Things will not always be like this
There is so much more in store
I know that your boyfriend has did you wrong
He has torn your poor heart in two
Sometimes you feel so unsure of yourself
And you just don't know what to do
Just pick your heart up from off the floor
And start again
Many other guys want to get that chance to meet you
There are other fish in the ocean
It really hurts to suffer
Nothing but grief and sorrow
Keep your head up and smile
For there will always be tomorrow"
647,Emotion,GirlPoemsgGirlInAPhotoPoembyFrancisCurran,"The devil twinkling of an eye,
The shape, the look of you,
Not being privy to your scent,
Sound of your words resound, resonating,

Unthought things,
Base things, but natural, absolute,
Such as,
I want to sleep inside you."
648,Emotion,GirlPoemsHowALittleGirlSangPoembyVachelLindsay,"Ah, she was music in herself,
A symphony of joyousness.
She sang, she sang from finger tips,
From every tremble of her dress.
I saw sweet haunting harmony,
An ecstasy, an ecstasy,
In that strange curling of her lips,
That happy curling of her lips.
And quivering with melody
Those eyes I saw, that tossing head.
And so I saw what music was,
Tho' still accursed with ears of lead."
649,Emotion,GirlPoemsCanadianGirlPoembyVikramGAarella,"Dark clouds had just burst into rain,
I was alone, travelling in the train.
It was just beginning to gain speed,
I had with me Sunday newspaper to read.
The girl sitting opposite to me, started
To complain, as her seat faced backward.
I offered to exchange seats for her
In return I had to accept her offer.
Of buying coffee for both of us,
Friendship with this girl began thus.
I thought, she must be an American,
From her accent, but she denied to be one.
Her father was Scottish and mother Hungarian
But she considered herself as a proud Canadian.
We talked our way through the long journey
On drinks, it was my turn to spend money."
650,Emotion,GirlPoemsTheSoulOfAGirlPoembyAubreeJaontalli,"Look upon this face, what do you see
A Girl with wondering eyes and a dancing soul
Secrets that will never be told
Mysteries that are so strange that few would understand
She holds the world in the palm of her hand
Dreams and wishes are shown in the smile
And her gleaming eyes can be seen over a mile
Her pressures and fears she hides behind her back
Her emotions can be seen like that!
The key to her heart is locked up tight
For she doubts she will meet the one that's just right
To be strong is harder that you would believe
Its like trying to fly away even though you would never leave
Her spirit soars high above the sky
And she dreams of a better place...
Sometimes its simply lying in the rye"

She is randy as a wolf.
She will not walk away and leave these bones

She is a green tree in a forest of kindling.
She is a greeen girl in a used poet.

when she can break through gray hairs
into blossom
and her lovers will harvest
honey and thyme
and the woods will be wild
with the damn wonder of it."
653,Emotion,GirlPoemsTheBushGirlPoembyHenryLawson,"So you rode from the range where your brothers “select,”
Through the ghostly grey bush in the dawn---
You rode slowly at first, lest her heart should suspect
That you were glad to be gone;
You had scarcely the courage to glance back at her
By the homestead receding from view,
And you breathed with relief as you rounded the spur,
For the world was a wide world to you.
Grey eyes that grow sadder than sunset or rain,
Fond heart that is ever more true
Firm faith that grows firmer for watching in vain---
She’ll wait by the sliprails for you.
Ah! The world is a new and a wide one to you,
But the world to your sweetheart is shut,
For a change never comes to the lonely Bush girl
From the stockyard, the bush, and the hut;
And the only relief from the dullness she feels
Is when ridges grow softened and dim,
And away in the dusk to the sliprails she steals
To dream of past meetings “with him.”
Do you think, where, in place of bare fences, dry creeks,
Clear streams and green hedges are seen---
Where the girls have the lily and rose in their cheeks,
And the grass in midsummer is green---
Do you think now and then, now or then, in the whirl
Of the city, while London is new,
Of the hut in the Bush, and the freckled-faced girl
Who is eating her heart out for you?
Grey eyes that are sadder than sunset or rain,
Bruised heart that is ever more true,
Fond faith that is firmer for trusting in vain---
She waits by the sliprails for you"
654,Emotion,GirlPoemsWhereDoYouGoGirlPoembyMichaelShepherd,"Where do you go, girl,
when you fall asleep?
for even when we've spent a passion's time,
you, all woman and all animal,
and then drift gently into sleep
and I to watch you drift -
you're straight away a girl again.
Do you dream a girlhood's dearest dreams?
or roam a woman's world?
What girlhood's safe, safe place
do you retreat to
in your private sleep?
Was it when the only man to love
was your beloved father,
still recovering from a wartime's hangover
with alcohol - and your so fierce, despairing help?
Where do you go in sleep?
while I now watch  this unknown girl;
an upper lip that asks so innocently
to be kissed?
And lower lip that just so innocently
enjoys?
Where do you go, girl,
so far, so many years away from me?
Where do you go, girl?"
655,Emotion,GirlPoemsAnEnglishGirlPoembyWilliamSchwenckGilbert,"A wonderful joy our eyes to bless,
In her magnificent comeliness,
Is an English girl of eleven stone two,
And five foot ten in her dancing shoe!
She follows the hounds, and on she pounds -
The ""field"" tails off and the muffs diminish -
Over the hedges and brooks she bounds -
Straight as a crow, from find to finish.
At cricket, her kin will lose or win -
She and her maids, on grass and clover,
Eleven maids out - eleven maids in -
(And perhaps an occasional ""maiden over"").
Go search the world and search the sea,
Then come you home and sing with me
There's no such gold and no such pearl
As a bright and beautiful English girl!
With a ten-mile spin she stretches her limbs,
She golfs, she punts, she rows, she swims -
She plays, she sings, she dances, too,
From ten or eleven till all is blue!
At ball or drum, till small hours come
(Chaperon's fan conceals her yawning),
She'll waltz away like a teetotum,
And never go home till daylight's dawning.
Lawn tennis may share her favours fair -
Her eyes a-dance and her cheeks a-glowing -
Down comes her hair, but what does she care?
It's all her own and it's worth the showing!
Go search the world and search the sea,
Then come you home and sing with me
There's no such gold and no such pearl
As a bright and beautiful English girl!
Her soul is sweet as the ocean air,
For prudery knows no haven there;
To find mock-modesty, please apply
To the conscious blush and the downcast eye.
Rich in the things contentment brings,
In every pure enjoyment wealthy,
Blithe as a beautiful bird she sings,
For body and mind are hale and healthy.
Her eyes they thrill with right goodwill -
Her heart is light as a floating feather -
As pure and bright as the mountain rill
That leaps and laughs in the Highland heather!
Go search the world and search the sea,
Then come you home and sing with me
There's no such gold and no such pearl
As a bright and beautiful English girl!"
656,Emotion,GirlPoemsDaddysGirlPoembyAngieWatson,"As the young woman remembers her childhood
She begins to cry,
Remembering how much she loved her father.
Just thinking how he'd left her so soon
Breaks her heart in two.
She remembered when she was a little child:
A curly haired little girl
Attached to her daddy's leg.
The way she'd hide behind her daddy
When people spoke to her.
She remembered how he'd loved her
And wondered if he knew she loved him too.
She remembered how she'd cried that night
At the hospital
When the thought of never getting to see her daddy again
Had crossed her mind.
She remembered how everything she'd done
Was so sweet to him.
She remembered the times she'd never let go
Of the belt loops of his pants.
She remembered how he loved her so
And how she'd never be able to stay angry with him.
But the girl will never forget
That her daddy will be in her heart always
And she will always be
Daddy's little girl."

to see herself tonight."
658,Emotion,GirlPoemsNoOneUnderstandsHeartacheLikeABeautifulGirlPoembyMeaganPeters,"In a world of barbies, implants and a size 26 waist
heartache's no more prevalent than in her with a beautiful face.
No more wanted for her looks than her heart
her persona fades as soon as puberty starts.
She screams celebrity in a small town manner
In a world that passes judgement by how much you achieve
she must use her 'talents' as the world perceives.
As years go by her beauty's but a nuisance
to the person inside made up of more substance.
She SCREAMS celebrity in a small town manner
There's no plastic surgery to alter your soul
no place for outward beauty in the world of good will.
To wed true love's but a leap of trust
so she squanders her beauty as a matter of must.
For small town love in true Hollywood fashion."
659,Emotion,GirlPoemsTheBlindGirlPoembyWilliamTopazMcGonagall,"Kind Christians, pray list to me,
And I'll relate a sad story,
Concerning a little blind girl, only nine years of age,
Who lived with her father in a lonely cottage.
Poor girl, she had never seen the blessed light of day,
Nor the beautiful fields of corn and hay,
Nor the sparrows, that lifted their heads at early morn
To bright Sol that does the hills adorn.
And near the cottage door there was an elm tree;
But that stunted elm tree she never did see,
Yet her little heart sometimes felt gay
As she listened to the thrushes that warbled the live-long day.
And she would talk to the wren when alone,
And to the wren she would her loneliness bemoan,
And say, ""Dear little wren, come again to-morrow;
Now be sure and come, your singing will chase away my sorrow.""
She was motherless, but she had a drunken father,
Who in his savage moods drank all he could gather,
And would often cruelly beat her until she would cry,
""Dear father, if you beat me I will surely die.""
She spent the days in getting ready her father's food,
Which was truly for her drunken father's good;
But one night he came home, reeling drunk,
And the poor child's heart with fear sunk;
And he cried, ""You were at the door when I came up the lane;
Take that, you good-for-nothing slut; you're to blame
For not having my supper ready; you will find
That's no excuse, Sarah, because you are blind.""
And with a stick he struck her as he spoke
Across the shoulders, until the stick almost broke;
Crying aloud, ""I'll teach you better, you little sneak;""
And with the beating, Sarah's heart was like to break.
Poor little Sarah had never seen the snow;
She knew it was beautiful white, some children told her so;
And in December, when the snow began to fall,
She would go to the door and make a snowball.
One day she'd been very cheerless and alone,
Poor child, and so cold, almost chilled to the bone;
For her father had spent his wages in drink,
And for want of fire she was almost at death's brink.
Her face was pinched with hunger but she never complained,
And her little feet with cold were chilblained,
And her father that day had not come home for dinner,
And the dull grey sky was all of a shimmer.
So poor Sarah was very sick when her father came home;
So bad, little dear, that she did sigh and moan,
And when her father saw her in bed
He was heart-stricken with fear and dread.
So within a few days poor Sarah did die,
And for the loss of Sarah the drunken father did cry,
So the loss of his child soon converted him
From drinking either whiskey, rum or gin."
660,Emotion,GirlPoemsTheLittleMatchGirlPoembyWilliamTopazMcGonagall,"It was biting cold, and the falling snow,
Which filled a poor little match girl's heart with woe,
Who was bareheaded and barefooted, as she went along the street,
Crying, ""Who'll buy my matches? for I want pennies to buy some meat!""
When she left home she had slippers on;
But, alas! poor child, now they were gone.
For she lost both of them while hurrying across the street,
Out of the way of two carriages which were near by her feet.
So the little girl went on, while the snow fell thick and fast;
And the child's heart felt cold and downcast,
For nobody had bought any matchea that day,
Which filled her little mind with grief and dismay.
Alas! she was hungry and shivering with cold;
So in a corner between two houses she made bold
To take shelter from the violent storm.
Poor little waif! wishing to herself she'd never been born.
And she grew colder and colder, and feared to go home
For fear of her father beating her; and she felt woe-begone
Because she could carry home no pennies to buy bread,
And to go home without pennies she was in dread.
The large flakes of snow covered her ringlets of fair hair;
While the passers-by for her had no care,
As they hurried along to their homes at a quick pace,
While the cold wind blew in the match girl's face.
As night wore on her hands were numb with cold,
And no longer her strength could her uphold,
When an idea into her little head came:
She'd strike a match and warm her hands at the flame.
And she lighted the match, and it burned brightly,
And it helped to fill her heart with glee;
And she thought she was sitting at a stove very grand;
But, alas! she was found dead, with a match in her hand!
Her body was found half-covered with snow,
And as the people gazed thereon their hearts were full of woe;
And many present let fall a burning tear
Because she was found dead on the last night of the year,
In that mighty city of London, wherein is plenty of gold -
But, alas! their charity towards street waifs is rather cold.
But I hope the match girl's in Heaven, beside her Saviour dear,
A bright reward for all the hardships she suffered here."
661,Emotion,GirlPoemsAboutTheLittleGirlThatBeatHerSisterPoembyAnnTaylor,"Go, go, my naughty girl, and kiss
Your little sister dear;
I must not have such things as this,
And noisy quarrels here.
What! little children scratch and fight,
That ought to be so mild;
Oh! Mary, it's a shocking sight
To see an angry child.
I can't imagine, for my part,
The reason for your folly;
She did not do you any hurt
By playing with your dolly.
See, see, the little tears that run
Fast from her watery eye:
Come, my sweet innocent, have done,
'Twill do no good to cry.
Go, Mary, wipe her tears away,
And make it up with kisses:
And never turn a pretty play
To such a pet as this is."

Every day breaking like bones
Against the heartless pavement

Growing extinct
In the dying rainforest.
Divorce and disintegrating family life

With the malicious hands
Of a marauding thief,

Stranded on some dirty street
In the hopeless dawn

To get back home,
Take my twenty free,

Their utmost bounty on thy head:
And these grey rocks; that household lawn;
Those trees, a veil just half withdrawn;
This fall of water that doth make
A murmur near the silent lake;
This little bay; a quiet road
That holds in shelter thy Abode--
In truth together do ye seem
Like something fashioned in a dream;
Such Forms as from their covert peep
When earthly cares are laid asleep!
But, O fair Creature! in the light
Of common day, so heavenly bright,
I bless Thee, Vision as thou art,
I bless thee with a human heart;
God shield thee to thy latest years!
Thee, neither know I, nor thy peers;
And yet my eyes are filled with tears.
With earnest feeling I shall pray
For thee when I am far away:
For never saw I mien, or face,
In which more plainly I could trace
Benignity and home-bred sense
Ripening in perfect innocence.
Here scattered, like a random seed,
Remote from men, Thou dost not need
The embarrassed look of shy distress,
And maidenly shamefacedness:
Thou wear'st upon thy forehead clear
The freedom of a Mountaineer:
A face with gladness overspread!
Soft smiles, by human kindness bred!
And seemliness complete, that sways
Thy courtesies, about thee plays;
With no restraint, but such as springs
From quick and eager visitings
Of thoughts that lie beyond the reach
Of thy few words of English speech:
A bondage sweetly brooked, a strife
That gives thy gestures grace and life!
So have I, not unmoved in mind,
Seen birds of tempest-loving kind--
Thus beating up against the wind.
What hand but would a garland cull
For thee who art so beautiful?
O happy pleasure! here to dwell
Beside thee in some heathy dell;
Adopt your homely ways, and dress,
A Shepherd, thou a Shepherdess!
But I could frame a wish for thee
More like a grave reality:
Thou art to me but as a wave
Of the wild sea; and I would have
Some claim upon thee, if I could,
Though but of common neighbourhood.
What joy to hear thee, and to see!
Thy elder Brother I would be,
Thy Father--anything to thee!
Now thanks to Heaven! that of its grace
Hath led me to this lonely place.
Joy have I had; and going hence
I bear away my recompense.
In spots like these it is we prize
Our Memory, feel that she hath eyes:
Then, why should I be loth to stir?
I feel this place was made for her;
To give new pleasure like the past,
Continued long as life shall last.
Nor am I loth, though pleased at heart,
Sweet Highland Girl! from thee to part;
For I, methinks, till I grow old,
As fair before me shall behold,
As I do now, the cabin small,
The lake, the bay, the waterfall;
And thee, the spirit of them all!"
664,Emotion,GirlPoemsPeaceLittleGirlPeacePoembyMiaOcean,"The poor young girl
with beach blonde hair
and pale white skin
stands in the middle of the street,
in the middle of a war.
Her face shows pain,
her face shows she wants help.
She goes to the hardware store
and steals a can of purple paint.
She doesn't know better,
so it doesn't matter.
The pale girl opens the can of purple paint
and uses her hands to write a message on the
big brick building wall.
She uses what knowledge she has of spelling,
and traces her purple paint covered fingers
over the wall.
First she draws a P
than an E
than she dips her hand back in the paint.
When she is done with the word,
the purple paint has run down the wall,
but you could still see the word very clearly.
It spelled PEACE.
The young girl takes her hand and presses it to the wall
leaving a very small purple handprint.
Then she runs.
A soldier calls after her,
'Peace little girl, Peace! '"
665,Emotion,GirlPoemsWorldWearyGirlPoembyUriahHamilton,"World-weary girl,
Tears form in your eyes,
Confusion swirls
Like a virulent tornado
Around your heart,
Rending the fragile fabric of your soul,
I fear, irreparably apart.
I want to kiss your delicate face,
Gently touch your hair,
Reassure you I’m on your side,
Reassure you that I care.
World-weary girl,
Invite me into your life,
Help me understand your story
If we have to talk unceasingly
Through the dark and lonely night.
I believe in your struggle,
And I’ll send sympathetic prayers into the universe
Until I know the dawn of a new embrace
Has brought you into the arms
Of an indisputable and transforming love."
666,Emotion,GirlPoemsGirlInLovePoembyRainerMariaRilke,"That's my window. This minute
So gently did I alight
From sleep--was still floating in it.
Where has my life its limit
And where begins the night?
I could fancy all things around me
Were nothing but I as yet;
Like a crystal's depth, profoundly
Mute, translucent, unlit.
I have space to spare inside me
For the stars, too: so full of room
Feels my heart; so lightly
Would it let go of him, whom
For all I know I have started
To love, it may be to hold.
Strange, as if never charted,
Stares my fortune untold.
Why is it I am bedded
Beneath this infinitude,
Fragrant like a meadow,
Hither and thither moved,
Calling out, yet fearing
Someone might hear the cry,
Destined to disappearing
Within another I."
667,Emotion,GirlPoemsJustALittleGirlPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"You subjected her to a night of hell
Hey! Did you know?
She was just a little girl
You took her to a run down motel
Hey! Did you know?
She was just a little girl
Now you hold her crying soul to sell
Hey! Did you know?
She was just a little girl
When you forced her out of her shell
Hey! Did you know?
She was just a little girl
Couldn’t you tell by her face?
She had the smile of an angel
A virgin waiting for wedding bells
Hey! Did you know?
You are not well?
The only place you belong is a cell
With horrifying smells!
Hey! Did you know?
She is no more a little girl, they yell

668,Emotion,GirlPoemsCombatReadyGirlPoembyUriahHamilton,"I need a combat-ready girl
Who knows that the world
Is callous and cold,
Waiting to cut you down
Before giving you a chance
Or letting you dance.
She needs to be
A solitude queen,
Close friends
With loneliness
But with inner perseverance.
I want to defend someone
And be defended
From the raging stupidity
And insensitivity
Of heartless society!
True love
Is the unity
Of emotional soldiers,
Fighting for kisses,
Fighting for closeness,
Fighting for trust,
Fighting against all the odds
While sharing embraces
In the march
Toward eternity.
I need this unbreakable bond
Because lonely tears
Have the power
Of decimating bombs,
And one weary soldier
Will not survive
Those bombs alone."
669,Emotion,GirlPoemsIStillSeeThatGirlPoembyMaryNagy,"I see the girl of innocence
that you at one time were.
You have to take your life back.
You owe that much to her.
She needs you to unclutter
the hurt you've filed away.
The memories of tragedy
and the things you never say.
If your heart is filled with sadness
where's the room for happiness?
That girl deserves attention
and she'll stand for nothing less!
Your soul is not a graveyard
for you to bury all your pain.
You can't hold in the feelings
that are driving you insane.
Purge your hate and anger.
Pour your darkness out.
Let your pain be recognized.
Hollar, scream, and shout!
No matter what it takes
just let her feel she's loved.
Don't allow her to be beaten,
abused....pushed and shoved.
That girl I know is hurting.
That girl deserves the best.
Make ''you'' a priority
and you will pass His test.
**For my sister Danielle.  I still see that innocent girl from our childhood.  I hope you see her too.  Love, Mary"
670,Emotion,GirlPoemsACowherdingGirlPoembyMirabai,"The plums tasted
sweet to the unlettered desert-tribe girl-
but what manners! To chew into each! She was ungainly,
low-caste, ill mannered and dirty,
but the god took the
fruit she'd been sucking.
Why? She'd knew how to love.
She might not distinquish
splendor from filth
but she'd tasted the nectar of passion.
Might not know any Veda,
but a chariot swept her away-
now she frolics in heaven, esctatically bound
to her god.
The Lord of Fallen Fools, says Mira,
will save anyone
who can practice rapture like that-
I myself in a previous birth
was a cowherding girl
at Gokul."
671,Emotion,GirlPoemsIWasThatGirlPoembyMaryNagy,"I was that girl...in the shadows
of an ever-dying love.
I was that girl...searching for God
just begging for help from above.
I was that girl...in the darkness
trying to find my way.
I was that girl...raised in violence
and then selfishly thrown away.
I was that girl...full of anger
for the past and all of the pain.
I was that girl....but now I'm not

Loves nothing more then self harm

Doesn’t know how much longer she can keep trying
Everyday she’s slowly dying

Wants nothing more then to be free

673,Emotion,GirlPoemsServantGirlAndGrocersBoyPoembyJoyceKilmer,"Her lips' remark was: ""Oh, you kid!""
Her soul spoke thus (I know it did):
""O king of realms of endless joy,
My own, my golden grocer's boy,
I am a princess forced to dwell
Within a lonely kitchen cell,
While you go dashing through the land
With loveliness on every hand.
Your whistle strikes my eager ears
Like music of the choiring spheres.
The mighty earth grows faint and reels
Beneath your thundering wagon wheels.
How keenly, perilously sweet
To cling upon that swaying seat!
How happy she who by your side
May share the splendors of that ride!
Ah, if you will not take my hand
And bear me off across the land,
Then, traveller from Arcady,
Remain awhile and comfort me.
What other maiden can you find
So young and delicate and kind?""
Her lips' remark was: ""Oh, you kid!""
Her soul spoke thus (I know it did)."
674,Emotion,GirlPoemsSweetCountryGirlAndIPoembyPaultheLion,"My eyes first caught her across the street
She looked like someone I'd fancy to meet
She was wearing a long violet dress
But I was rugged and my hair was a mess
You were wondering who was this cat
Sitting on a rotten bench in a dirty cowboy hat
On his guitar he was trying to play some John Denver song
You laughed because half of his chords were wrong
She walked up and asked if I wanted a cuppa joe
I boyishly smiled and said 'I reckon so'
I strolled down the dirt road with this girl in a pretty gown
She said there wasn't a single paved street in town
At the restaurant he informed you that he was from Amarillo
Where the cops are awful and the democrats are yellow
You smiled and said 'tha pigs are worse here, I'll bet ya'
You nonetheless added 'welcome to Georgia'
I grinned as I stuck a Marlboro in my mouth
And told her it was my sixth trip down south
I said I enjoyed rural towns in this part of the States
Where life is simple with no technological updates
You somberly said you no longer find this place desirous
For the city of Atlanta is spreading like a virus
You said your days are full of concern and strife
For Atlanta's threatening your way of life
After coffee we took a long walk in the park
It was peaceful, there were no dogs there to bark
I told her I though she was very pretty
And apologized that I was so dirty
You bashfully accepted the compliments from this young man
And said 'well ah tra to make masef as beautiful as ah can'
Then he kissed you, which was a bit of a surprise
But you didn't mind as you closed your eyes
I felt kinda guilty for kissing her quickly without reason
So I told her she was obviously very smart and a good person
I said she was much nicer than city slicking bitches
Who are materialistic, dishonest and untrustworthy snitches
You looked into his weather hardened yet pretty face
And offered to take you both back to your place
He lowered his head and shyly agreed
You were glad you didn't have to plead
I awoke before her
With my mind a blur
But I hurriedly left a note saying I must catch a Greyhound
For it was San Francisco where I was bound
You woke up with an empty stare
For he was not there
You probably thought to him it was just a game
And that all men are the same"

I prayed, at first, a little Girl,
Because they told me to—
But stopped, when qualified to guess
How prayer would feel—to me—
If I believed God looked around,
Each time my Childish eye
Fixed full, and steady, on his own
In Childish honesty—
And told him what I'd like, today,
And parts of his far plan
That baffled me—
The mingled side
Of his Divinity—
And often since, in Danger,
I count the force 'twould be
To have a God so strong as that
To hold my life for me
Till I could take the Balance
That tips so frequent, now,
It takes me all the while to poise—
And then—it doesn't stay—"

Seven slim race-horses ready for a run;
Seven gold butterflies, flitting overhead;
Seven red roses blowing in a garden bed;
Seven white lilies, with honey bees inside them;
Seven round rainbows with clouds to divide them;
Seven pretty little girls with sugar on their lips;
Seven witty little boys, whom everybody tips;
Seven nice fathers, to call little maids joys;
Seven nice mothers, to kiss the little boys;
Seven nights running I dreamt it all plain;
With bread and jam for supper I could dream it all again!"

685,Emotion,GirlPoemsOdeToTheOnlyGirlPoembyJohnWilliams,"I've seen you many times in many places--
Theater, bus, train, or on the street;
Smiling in spring rain, in winter sleet,
Eyes of any hue in myriad faces;
Midnight black, all shades of brown your hair,
Long, short, bronze or honey-fair.
Instantly have I loved, have never spoken;
Slowly a truck passed, a light changed,
A door closed--all seemingly pre-arranged--
Then you were gone forever, the spell was broken.
Ubiquitios only one, we've met before
A hundred times, and we'll meet again
As many more; in hills or forest glen,
On crowded street or lonely, peaceful shore;
Somewhere, someday--but how will we ever know
True love, how wil we ever know?"
686,Emotion,GirlPoemsSparrowTheSpecialDelightOfMyGirlPoembyGaiusValeriusCatullus,"Sparrow, the special delight of my girl,
whom often she teases and holds on her lap
and pokes with the tip of her finger, provoking
counterattacks with your mordant beak,
whenever my luminous love desires
something or other, innocuous fun,
a bit of escape, I suppose, from her pain,
a moment of peace from her turbulent passion,
I wish I could play like she does with you
and lighten the cares of my sorrowful soul.
It thrills me as much as the nimble girl
in the story was thrilled by the gilded apple
that finally uncinched her virginal gown."
687,Emotion,GirlPoemsHowALittleGirlDancedPoembyVachelLindsay,"DEDICATED TO LUCY BATES
(Being a reminiscence of certain private theatricals.)
Oh, cabaret dancer,
I
know a dancer,
Whose eyes have not looked on the feasts that are vain.
I
know a dancer,
I
know a dancer,
Whose soul has no bond with the beasts of the plain:
Judith the dancer, Judith the dancer,
With foot like the snow, and with step like the rain.
Oh, thrice-painted dancer, vaudeville dancer,
Sad in your spangles, with soul all astrain,
I
know a dancer,
I
know a dancer,
Whose laughter and weeping are spiritual gain,
A pure-hearted, high-hearted maiden evangel,
With strength the dark cynical earth to disdain.
Flowers of bright Broadway, you of the chorus,
Who sing in the hope of forgetting your pain:
I turn to a sister of Sainted Cecilia,
A white bird escaping the earth's tangled skein:—
The music of God is her innermost brooding,
The whispering angels her footsteps sustain.
Oh, proud Russian dancer: praise for your dancing.
No clean human passion my rhyme would arraign.
You dance for Apollo with noble devotion,
A high cleansing revel to make the heart sane.
But Judith the dancer prays to a spirit
More white than Apollo and all of his train.
I know a dancer who finds the true Godhead,
Who bends o'er a brazier in Heaven's clear plain.
I know a dancer, I know a dancer,
Who lifts us toward peace, from this earth that is vain:
Judith the dancer, Judith the dancer,
With foot like the snow, and with step like the rain."
688,Emotion,GirlPoemsAStrandedGirlOnAFridayNightPoembyUriahHamilton,"She was weeping when we met
Outside a party store
Where the lonely purchase their wine;
Her boyfriend had left her behind
All sad and lost after a fight,
Most likely, about inconsequential things.
I picked her up, half out of human kindness,
Half to be beside a female body
Despite how red and unhappy her face.
She was a beautiful girl in a simple way,
She wore a plain flowery dress
With some charming appeal I can’t explain.
She tried to express in broken sentences
Why she and her boyfriend were upset;
I mostly heard tears and my boyfriend this,
My boyfriend that,
I tried to act like it was as completely earth shattering
As she thought it was.
She gave me directions to where she lived,
I drove diligently toward that destination
Without any attempts to prolong the drive
While I planned out my own strategy of a pass.
When I finally arrived at her place,
Her face was still red but the tears had dried.
She said, “Thanks, mister, you’re a nice guy.”
She got a little closer to me and touched my hand.
I thought she might kiss me, I thought I might kiss her,
But she scooted on out and made for her house.
I wasn’t expecting any action that night,
I can’t claim disappointment.
But I wish I knew if I should pray
For her and her boyfriend to work things out."

hugging it ever so tight;
hopeing that he will choose not to do

Her breathing is ever so shallow
no signs of life in her.
A technique she's developed with perfection,
to guard her twisted world.
'Maybe he will think i'm dead, ' she hopes
'For he can't see me breath,
perhapes for just one night,
he will turn around and leave'
Her wishes fade away in the night
as he climb into her bed
and any hopes of fooling him
are replaced with anquish and dread.
She knows too well the ritual,
it's the same as the night before.
The abuser will take what he wants from her
and no words will this child implore.
For she tries so hard to please him
and everyone she loved.
Yet all of the time she cringes
from their touch.
While she is huddled against the wall
never once looked in to he's eyes
She can almost she him smiling
as he rape this child of nine.
This little girl holds back the tears.
she knows she soon will cry
she utters not a single word.
As he enjoys the one he despise.
And when the torment is over,
he leave without a sound,
and the tears that she's been holding  back,
fall silently to the ground."

Moves slowly through
The lonely night;
The effects of drugs
Are wearing off…
And dawn has no promise
Of sunlight and pleasant songs."
694,Emotion,GirlPoemsTheHappiestGirlInTheWorldPoembyAugustaDaviesWebster,"A week ago; only a little week:
it seems so much much longer, though that day
is every morning still my yesterday;
as all my life 'twill be my yesterday,
for all my life is morrow to my love.
Oh fortunate morrow! Oh sweet happy love!
A week ago; and I am almost glad
to have him now gone for this little while,
that I may think of him and tell myself
what to be his means, now that I am his,
and know if mine is love enough for him,
and make myself believe it all is true.
A week ago; and it seems like a life,
and I have not yet learned to know myself:
I am so other than I was, so strange,
grown younger and grown older all in one;
and I am not so sad and not so gay;
and I think nothing, only hear him think.
That morning, waking, I remembered him
""Will he be here to-day? he often comes; --
and is it for my sake or to kill time?""
and, wondering ""Will he come?"" I chose the dress
he seemed to like the best, and hoped for him;
and did not think I could quite love him yet.
And did I love him then with all my heart?
or did I wait until he held my hands
and spoke ""Say, shall it be?"" and kissed my brow,
and I looked at him and he knew it all?
And did I love him from the day we met?
but I more gladly danced with some one else
who waltzed more smoothly and was merrier:
and did I love him when he first came here?
but I more gladly talked with some one else
whose words were readier and who sought me more.
When did I love him? How did it begin?
The small green spikes of snowdrops in the spring
are there one morning ere you think of them;
still we may tell what morning they pierced up:
June rosebuds stir and open stealthily,
and every new blown rose is a surprise;
still we can date the day when one unclosed:
but how can I tell when my love began?
Oh, was it like the young pale twilight star
that quietly breaks on the vacant sky,
is sudden there and perfect while you watch,
and, though you watch, you have not seen it dawn,
the star that only waited and awoke?
But he knows when he loved me; for he says
the first time we had met he told a friend
""The sweetest dewy daisy of a girl,
but not the solid stuff to make a wife;""
and afterwards the first time he was here,
when I had slipped away into our field
to watch alone for sunset brightening on
and heard them calling me, he says he stood
and saw me come along the coppice walk
beneath the green and sparkling arch of boughs,
and, while he watched the yellow lights that played
with the dim flickering shadows of the leaves
over my yellow hair and soft pale dress,
flitting across me as I flitted through,
he whispered inly, in so many words,
""I see my wife; this is my wife who comes,
and seems to bear the sunlight on with her:""
and that was when he loved me, so he says.
Yet is he quite sure? was it only then?
and had he had no thought which I could feel?
for why was it I knew that he would watch,
and all the while thought in my silly heart,
as I advanced demurely, it was well
I had on the pale dress with sweeping folds
which took the light and shadow tenderly,
and that the sunlights touched my hair and cheek,
because he'd note it all and care for it?
Oh vain and idle poor girl's heart of mine,
content with that coquettish mean content!
He, with his man's straight purpose, thinking ""wife,""
and I but that 'twas pleasant to be fair
and that 'twas pleasant he should count me fair.
But oh, to think he should be loving me
and I be no more moved out of myself!
The sunbeams told him, but they told me nought,
except that maybe I was looking well.
And oh had I but known! Why did no bird,
trilling its own sweet lovesong, as I passed,
so musically marvellously glad,
sing one for me too, sing me ""It is he,""
sing ""Love him,"" and ""You love him: it is he,""
that I might then have loved him when he loved,
that one dear moment might be date to both?
And must I not be glad he hid his thought
and did not tell me then, when it was soon
and I should have been startled, and not known
how he is just the one man I can love,
and, only with some pain lest he were pained,
and nothing doubting, should have answered ""No.""
How strange life is! I should have answered ""No.""
Oh, can I ever be half glad enough
he is so wise and patient and could wait!
He waited as you wait the reddening fruit
which helplessly is ripening on the tree,
and not because it tries or longs or wills,
only because the sun will shine on it:
but he who waited was himself that sun.
Oh was it worth the waiting? was it worth?
For I am half afraid love is not love,
this love which only makes me rest in him
and be so happy and so confident,
this love which makes me pray for longest days
that I may have them all to use for him,
this love which almost makes me yearn for pain
that I might have borne something for his sake,
this love which I call love, is less than love.
Where are the fires and fevers and the pangs?
where is the anguish of too much delight,
and the delirious madness at a kiss,
the flushing and the paling at a look,
and passionate ecstasy of meeting hands?
where is the eager weariness at time
that will not bate a single measured hour
to speed to us the far-off wedding day?
I am so calm and wondering, like a child
who, led by a firm hand it knows and trusts
along a stranger country beautiful
with a bewildering beauty to new eyes
if they be wise to know what they behold,
finds newness everywhere but no surprise,
and takes the beauty as an outward part
of being led so kindly by the hand.
I am so cold: is mine but a child's heart,
and not a woman's fit for such a man?
Alas am I too cold, am I too dull,
can I not love him as another could?
And oh, if love be fire, what love is mine
that is but like the pale subservient moon
who only asks to be earth's minister?
And, oh, if love be whirlwind, what is mine
that is but like a little even brook
which has no aim but flowing to the sea,
and sings for happiness because it flows?
Ah well, I would that I could love him more
and not be only happy as I am;
I would that I could love him to his worth,
with that forgetting all myself in him,
that subtle pain of exquisite excess,
that momentary infinite sharp joy,
I know by books but cannot teach my heart:
and yet I think my love must needs be love,
since he can read me through -- oh happy strange,
my thoughts that were my secrets all for me
grown instantly his open easy book! --
since he can read me through, and is content.
And yesterday, when they all went away,
save little Amy with her daisy chains,
and left us in that shadow of tall ferns,
and the child, leaning on me, fell asleep,
and I, tired by the afternoon long walk,
said ""I could almost gladly sleep like her,""
did he not answer, drawing down my head,
""Sleep, darling, let me see you rest on me,""
and when the child, awaking, wakened me,
did he not say ""Dear, you have made me glad,
for, seeing you so sleeping peacefully,
I feel that you do love me utterly,
no questionings, no regrettings, but at rest.""
Oh yes, my good true darling, you spoke well
""No questionings, no regrettings, but at rest:""
what should I question, what should I regret,
now I have you who are my hope and rest?
I am the feathery wind-wafted seed
that flickered idly half a merry morn,
now thralled into the rich life-giving earth
to root and bud and waken into leaf
and make it such poor sweetness as I may;
the prisoned seed that never more shall float
the frolic playfellow of summer winds
and mimic the free changeful butterfly;
the prisoned seed that prisoned finds its life
and feels its pulses stir, and grows, and grows.
Oh love, who gathered me into yourself,
oh love, I am at rest in you, and live.
And shall I for so many coming days
be flower and sweetness to him? Oh pale flower,
grow, grow, and blossom out, and fill the air,
feed on his richness, grow, grow, blossom out,
and fill the air, and be enough for him.
Oh crystal music of the air-borne lark,
so falling, nearer, nearer, from the sky,
are you a message to me of dear hopes?
oh trilling gladness, flying down to earth,
have you brought answer of sweet prophecy?
have you brought answer to the thoughts in me?
Oh happy answer, and oh happy thoughts!
and which is the bird's carol, which my heart's?
My love, my love, my love! And I shall be
so much to him, so almost everything:
and I shall be the friend whom he will trust,
and I shall be the child whom he will teach,
and I shall be the servant he will praise,
and I shall be the mistress he will love,
and I shall be his wife. Oh days to come,
will ye not pass like gentle rhythmic steps
that fall to sweetest music noiselessly?
But I have known the lark's song half sound sad,
and I have seen the lake, which rippled sun,
toss dimmed and purple in a sudden wind;
and let me laugh a moment at my heart
that thinks the summer-time must all be fair,
that thinks the good days always must be good:
yes let me laugh a moment -- may be weep.
But no, but no, not laugh; for through my joy
I have been wise enough to know the while
some tears and some long hours are in all lives,
in every promised land some thorn plants grow,
some tangling weeds as well as laden vines:
and no, not weep; for is not my land fair,
my land of promise flushed with fruit and bloom?
and who would weep for fear of scattered thorns?
and very thorns bear oftentimes sweet fruits.
Oh the black storm that breaks across the lake
ruffles the surface, leaves the deeps at rest --
deep in our hearts there always will be rest:
oh summer storms fall sudden as they rose,
the peaceful lake forgets them while they die --
our hearts will always have it summer time.
All rest, all summer time. My love, my love,
I know it will be so; you are so good,
and I, near you, shall grow at last like you;
and you are tender, patient -- oh I know
you will bear with me, help me, smile to me,
and let me make you happy easily;
and I, what happiness could I have more
than that dear labour of a happy wife?
I would not have another. Is it wrong,
and is it selfish that I cannot wish,
that I, who yet so love the clasping hand
and innocent fond eyes of little ones,
I cannot wish that which I sometimes read
is women's dearest wish hid in their love,
to press a baby creature to my breast?
Oh is it wrong? I would be all for him,
not even children coming 'twixt us two
to call me from his service to serve them;
and maybe they would steal too much of love,
for, since I cannot love him now enough,
what would my heart be halved? or would it grow?
But he perhaps would love me something less,
finding me not so always at his side.
Together always, that was what he said;
together always. Oh dear coming days!
O dear dear present days that pass too fast,
although they bring such rainbow morrows on!
that pass so fast, and yet, I know not why,
seem always to encompass so much time.
And I should fear I were too happy now,
and making this poor world too much my Heaven,
but that I feel God nearer and it seems
as if I had learned His love better too.
So late already! The sun dropping down,
and under him the first long line of red --
my truant should be here again by now,
is come maybe. I will not seek him, I;
he would be vain and think I cared too much;
I will wait here, and he shall seek for me,
and I will carelessly -- Oh his dear step --
he sees me, he is coming; my own love!"

More than another
What makes your heart beat so;

699,Emotion,GirlPoemsTheRightGirlForMePoembyErnestineNorthover,"I'm looking for a girl who's right for me,
One who knows how to talk intelligently,
She'll laugh at all my jokes,
And ignore the other blokes,
And find that I am just her cup of tea.
The task is not so easy, I have found,
There aren't that many 'right' ones still around,
But if they're out there somewhere,
And if any of them might care,
To find me, then I won't be going to ground.
My charisma can be in itself impressive,
My conversation I know is quite expressive,
I am kind in word and deed,
And I think you will concede,
That I wouldn't be someone who'd be repressive.
I can say that I'm a very balanced chap,
Who, when the going's tough would never flap,
But I'm really keen to find,
A lady of like mind,
Who in fact could quite ideally fill the gap.
So I'm hoping that this lady turns up soon,
Perhaps it could be this very afternoon,
I would greet her with a smile,
Which would certainly beguile,
And my vibrant personality should make her swoon.
So, do you think, that I could really have a chance,
Do you think that she would give me just one glance,
If this 'Miss Right' doesn't show,
That would really be a blow,
And put an end to all my thoughts of true romance.
No, there's got to be a girl who's right for me,
I won't believe there isn't, so soon you'll see,
An attractive lady on my arm,
A lady with such charm,
That eventually we'd become a Royal 'We'.

700,Emotion,SchoolPoemsSonnetOnSchoolLifePoembyDrACelestineRajManoharMD,"First day we stepped into a school was great-
In uniform with school-bag, looking cute!
We could not walk or run and had a slate;
We learnt to read and write and be not mute.
We learnt the Alphabets: count one to ten!
We ate so happily when school-bell rung;
Our teachers taught us how to hold the pen;
We can’t forget those days when we were young.
Our knowledge improved slowly every day;
Afilled with joy in hearts, we went to play;
Our teachers taught us manners and to pray;
The fees- our parents somehow tried to pay.
Although some hours, some days, we may detest,
The years we spent in school are sure the best!"
701,Emotion,SchoolPoemsIAmAYoungSchoolBoyPoembyVidyadharDurgekar,"I am a young school boy,
With a white shirt and black tie,
I dream to fly high,
Like a falcon in the sky,
Not bothered how, what and why?
We are a gang of five,
I  and my friends do try,
To read and play all the while,
I am a young school boy,
We have a sports teacher,
Who is a like bully bear,
His tantrums I don’t care,
I will  follow our class teacher;
We have a teacher in science
We pray for his absence,
As we all are tense,
During his class of no nonsense;
We have a moral teacher,
Who is nothing less than a preacher,
He is always in sparkling white,
His lectures are also upright;
Sir George is teaching us history,
He is always in a mystery,
About the Hitler’s victory,
He is the best among the faculty,
We have a teacher in English,
She hates us being childish,
She always behaves bullish,
When home work we don’t finish;
We promise, not to touch smack,
Nor  we change our dream track,
As it makes mind to crack,
I am a smart young school boy;
Mummy daddy behind my back,
To finish daily home work pack,
Before I change the track,
And run up to hit the sack,
I am a smart young school boy;"

When he came home he said his friend

And asked him what he learned
He told me about firemen
They taught him how not to get burned,
I sent my child to school today
He said, 'Do you know what they taught me? '
He told me they taught him numbers
As well as his ABC’s,
I sent my child to school today
A smile on his face
I gave him a kiss and a hug
And said, 'See ya funny face! ',
I sent my child to school today
His smile bright and wide
But an older child brought in a gun
How did he get it inside? ,
I sent my child to school today
As in every day
But the child with the gun started shooting
The reason? No one could say,
I buried my child after school today
All I can do is cry
I lost my child at school today
And nobody can tell me why."

How his wristwatch works
As he shadows me on the street.

And wears black.

Had stopped at five to eleven.

The gray building on the corner
Could've been a state pen,
And then he showed up with his watch,
Whose Gothic numerals
And the absence of hands
He wanted me to understand
Right then and there."

everyday
just to be told
you can't do it that way
you have to do it my way

but sometimes I wish my teachers
would get hit by a bus

but I haven't even said
that school everyday
I always dread
It feels like a prison
with no escape

we have to all week
but couldn't school be more fun
instead of really starting to reek!
But we have to go through it

It's almost christmas break

I just can't take.

and even though we are tortured
it isn't all bad

Six times winner. She's the
dame of all the books that you'd read
She'd rub against your shoulder
Oh so much bolder, you'd hang on
everything that she said
You'd never see slimmer
But she craved to be thinner
Those magazines really got to her head
Face painted pale,
Her tonsils' evil blare
She made sure that she always got heard
She's a Ballroom swinger
Kareoke singer. She's the epitimy
of all that I dread
Her face a bit older,
A heart getting colder
How will you ever get fed?
Now she's a real Hum-dinger
A fiesty city minger
There's one thing you'll have to accept
On her roads to decieve
She still spreads her disease
Never leaving  a heart unbled
So don't try to win her
Till you learn how to sting her
You'll be sleeping in an empty bed
For she'll take all your money
Then run to her Mummy
And leave you with a hole in your head"

there's a class on 'How to Frown'
Ms. Leech doesn't like me

on '20 Different Sneers'
I descended into trouble
for laughing down the stares
oh yes, I guess - I could wrinkle my brow
with the best of them
but my eyes would twinkle, somehow
while I sang the funeral hymn
Mr. Jenks says now my glower power
is no longer up to par
he's perplexed, 'cuz my aptitude tests
showed that I could go far
'You could have been director
of a top-notch funeral home
or a Principal scowling angrily
as through the halls you roam! '
But at my poor grades, I just have to laugh
for my heart my bearing mirrors
who cares if I got another F
for too many glaring errors?
after my course on Stern Disapproval
I was whistling in the hall
Mr. Ick demanded my instant removal
and the whole school was appalled
They dragged me to the Dean
who growled 'what's this I'm hearing of? ! '

Way back when we were in school
We tried our best to get passing grades
To prove to our folks we weren’t a fool
Remember those old-fashion desks?
There was an ink well right at the top
Some boys didn’t last too long at school
For they stayed home to pick the crops
Long walks home right after school
The stack of books made a heavy load
Kicking rocks but hurrying along
Down that dusty red dirt road
After all, there were always chores to do
Once a kid got back home
Gather the eggs and slop the hogs
Didn’t have a lot of time to roam
Yep, those were good old days, my friend
Nowadays seems school is a breeze
But it sure is fun to look behind us
To the wonderful old school memories!"

How long have they tugged the leash, and strained apart
My pack of unruly hounds: I cannot start
Them again on a quarry of knowledge they hate to hunt,
I can haul them and urge them no more.
No more can I endure to bear the brunt
Of the books that lie out on the desks: a full three score
Of several insults of blotted pages and scrawl
Of slovenly work that they have offered me.
I am sick, and tired more than any thrall
Upon the woodstacks working weariedly."

First Day at School
A millionbillionwillion miles from home
Waiting for the bell to go. (To go where?)
Why are they all so big, other children?
So noisy? So much at home they
Must have been born in uniform
Lived all their lives in playgrounds
Spent the years inventing games
That don't let me in. Games
That are rough, that swallow you up.
And the railings.
All around, the railings.
Are they to keep out wolves and monsters?
Things that carry off and eat children?
Things you don't take sweets from?
Perhaps they're to stop us getting out
Running away from the lessins. Lessin.
What does a lessin look like?
Sounds small and slimy.
They keep them in the glassrooms.
Whole rooms made out of glass. Imagine.
I wish I could remember my name
Mummy said it would come in useful.
Like wellies. When there's puddles.
Yellowwellies. I wish she was here.

Perhaps the teacher will read it for me.

714,Emotion,SchoolPoemsLinesWrittenAsASchoolExerciseAtHawksheadAnnoAetatisPoembyWilliamWordsworth,"'And has the Sun his flaming chariot driven
Two hundred times around the ring of heaven,
Since Science first, with all her sacred train,
Beneath yon roof began her heavenly reign?
While thus I mused, methought, before mine eyes,
The Power of EDUCATION seemed to rise;
Not she whose rigid precepts trained the boy
Dead to the sense of every finer joy;
Nor that vile wretch who bade the tender age
Spurn Reason's law and humour Passion's rage;
But she who trains the generous British youth
In the bright paths of fair majestic Truth:
Emerging slow from Academus' grove
In heavenly majesty she seemed to move.
Stern was her forehead, but a smile serene
'Softened the terrors of her awful mien.'
Close at her side were all the powers, designed
To curb, exalt, reform the tender mind:
With panting breast, now pale as winter snows,
Now flushed as Hebe, Emulation rose;
Shame followed after with reverted eye,
And hue far deeper than the Tyrian dye;
Last Industry appeared with steady pace,
A smile sat beaming on her pensive face.
I gazed upon the visionary train,
Threw back my eyes, returned, and gazed again.
When lo! the heavenly goddess thus began,
Through all my frame the pleasing accents ran.
''When Superstition left the golden light
And fled indignant to the shades of night;
When pure Religion reared the peaceful breast
And lulled the warring passions into rest,
Drove far away the savage thoughts that roll
In the dark mansions of the bigot's soul,
Enlivening Hope displayed her cheerful ray,
And beamed on Britain's sons a brighter day;
So when on Ocean's face the storm subsides,
Hushed are the winds and silent are the tides;
The God of day, in all the pomp of light,
Moves through the vault of heaven, and dissipates the
night;
Wide o'er the main a trembling lustre plays,
The glittering waves reflect the dazzling blaze
Science with joy saw Superstition fly
Before the lustre of Religion's eye;
With rapture she beheld Britannia smile,
Clapped her strong wings, and sought the cheerful isle,
The shades of night no more the soul involve,
She sheds her beam, and, lo! the shades dissolve;
No jarring monks, to gloomy cell confined,
With mazy rules perplex the weary mind;
No shadowy forms entice the soul aside,
Secure she walks, Philosophy her guide.
Britain, who long her warriors had adored,
And deemed all merit centred in the sword;
Britain, who thought to stain the field was fame,
Now honoured Edward's less than Bacon's name.
Her sons no more in listed fields advance
To ride the ring, or toss the beamy lance;
No longer steel their indurated hearts
To the mild influence of the finer arts;
Quick to the secret grotto they retire
To court majestic truth, or wake the golden lyre;
By generous Emulation taught to rise,
The seats of learning brave the distant skies.
Then noble Sandys, inspired with great design,
Reared Hawkshead's happy roof, and called it mine.
There have I loved to show the tender age
The golden precepts of the classic page;
To lead the mind to those Elysian plains
Where, throned in gold, immortal Science reigns;
Fair to the view is sacred Truth displayed,
In all the majesty of light arrayed,
To teach, on rapid wings, the curious soul
To roam from heaven to heaven, from pole to pole,
From thence to search the mystic cause of things
And follow Nature to her secret springs;
Nor less to guide the fluctuating youth
Firm in the sacred paths of moral truth,
To regulate the mind's disordered frame,
And quench the passions kindling into flame;
The glimmering fires of Virtue to enlarge,
And purge from Vice's dross my tender charge.
Oft have I said, the paths of Fame pursue,
And all that Virtue dictates, dare to do;
Go to the world, peruse the book of man,
And learn from thence thy own defects to scan;
Severely honest, break no plighted trust,
But coldly rest not here- be more than just;
Join to the rigours of the sires of Rome
The gentler manners of the private dome;
When Virtue weeps in agony of woe,
Teach from the heart the tender tear to flow;
If Pleasure's soothing song thy soul entice,
Or all the gaudy pomp of splendid Vice,
Arise superior to the Siren's power,
The wretch, the short-lived vision of an hour;
Soon fades her cheek, her blushing beauties fly,
As fades the chequered bow that paints the sky,
So shall thy sire, whilst hope his breast inspires,
And wakes anew life's glimmering trembling fires, 0
Hear Britain's sons rehearse thy praise with joy,
Look up to heaven, and bless his darling boy.
If e'er these precepts quelled the passions' strife,
If e'er they smoothed the rugged walks of life,
If e'er they pointed forth the blissful way
That guides the spirit to eternal day,
Do thou, if gratitude inspire thy breast,
Spurn the soft fetters of lethargic rest.
Awake, awake! and snatch the slumbering lyre,
Let this bright morn and Sandys the song inspire.'
'I looked obedience: the celestial Fair
Smiled like the morn, and vanished into air.'"

some look through me as though i'm made of glass...
But i like it this way..
i don't know why but it sort of made my day...
i sit alone all the time...
to me i think they are all slime...
Snobbery in my part i guess...
or maybe i'm just in a lonely mess...
whatever it is, i should start talking...
simply because assignments are coming...
But who would talk to a weirdo like me?
looks like i have to put on my mask for them to see..."
717,Emotion,SchoolPoemsTheOldBarkSchoolPoembyHenryLawson,"It was built of bark and poles, and the floor was full of holes
Where each leak in rainy weather made a pool;
And the walls were mostly cracks lined with calico and sacks –
There was little need for windows in the school.
Then we rode to school and back by the rugged gully-track,
On the old grey horse that carried three or four;
And he looked so very wise that he lit the master's eyes
Every time he put his head in at the door.
He had run with Cobb and Co. – ""that grey leader, let him go!""
There were men ""as knowed the brand upon his hide"",
And ""as knowed it on the course"". Funeral service: ""Good old horse!""
When we burnt him in the gully where he died.
And the master thought the same. 'Twas from Ireland that he came,
Where the tanks are full all summer, and the feed is simply grand;
And the joker then in vogue said his lessons wid a brogue –
'Twas unconscious imitation, let the reader understand.
And we learnt the world in scraps from some ancient dingy maps
Long discarded by the public-schools in town;
And as nearly every book dated back to Captain Cook
Our geography was somewhat upside-down.
It was ""in the book"" and so – well, at that we'd let it go,
For we never would believe that print could lie;
And we all learnt pretty soon that when we came out at noon
""The sun is in the south part of the sky.""
And Ireland! that was known from the coast-line to Athlone:
We got little information re the land that gave us birth;
Save that Captain Cook was killed (and was very likely grilled)
And ""the natives of New Holland are the lowest race on earth"".
And a woodcut, in its place, of the same degraded race
Seemed a lot more like a camel than the blackfellows that we knew;
Jimmy Bullock, with the rest, scratched his head and gave it best;
But his faith was sadly shaken by a bobtailed kangaroo.
But the old bark school is gone, and the spot it stood upon
Is a cattle-camp in winter where the curlew's cry is heard;
There's a brick school on the flat, but a schoolmate teaches that,
For, about the time they built it, our old master was ""transferred"".
But the bark school comes again with exchanges 'cross the plain –
With the Out-Back Advertiser; and my fancy roams at large
When I read of passing stock, of a western mob or flock,
With ""James Bullock"", ""Grey"", or ""Henry Dale"" in charge.
And I think how Jimmy went from the old bark school content,
With his ""eddication"" finished, with his pack-horse after him;
And perhaps if I were back I would take the self-same track,
For I wish my learning ended when the Master ""finished"" Jim."
718,Emotion,SchoolPoemsEvergreenSchoolDaysPoembyRaviSathasivam,"Our evergreen school days
will not come back again
From the nursery to high school
we learnt the best
and the best that taught by our teachers
Our school life was full of cheers
and lived with full of mischievous
but the discipline was maintained well
We sang and danced without
thinking of our future.
We spent money without earned them
When the school start after the vacation
we meet our friends happily and
welcomed new friends dearly
We played all the games and we won
many games with out care of sun or rain
Many years have been gone
today we live different parts of the world
but the memories of our school days
will live in our hearts as ever green days."
719,Emotion,SchoolPoemsGoingToSchoolPoembyClarenceMichaelJamesStanislausDennis,"Did you see them pass to-day, Billy, Kate and Robin,
All astride upon the back of old grey Dobbin?
Jigging, jogging off to school, down the dusty track -
What must Dobbin think of it - three upon his back?
Robin at the bridle-rein, in the middle Kate,
Billy holding on behind, his legs out straight.
Now they're coming back from school, jig, jog, jig.
See them at the corner where the gums grow big;
Dobbin flicking off the flies and blinking at the sun -
Having three upon his back he thinks is splendid fun:
Robin at the bridle-rein, in the middle Kate,
Little Billy up behind, his legs out straight."

A home so like a palace waiting for its queen? --
A dwelling place so fair,
So fill'd with treasures rare,
As the little white cottage on Evergreen Square?
Come, pretty school girl! lay your books aside;
Yes graduate tomorrow -- tomorrow be my bride;
My fortune share,
And reign queen there,
In the little white cottage on Evergreen Square.
Red as are the roses climbing on its wall,
Your cheeks of richer crimson shall out-bloom them all.
Your eyes (beyond compare)
A brighter gleam shall wear,
In the little white cottage on Everygreen Square.
Flow'rs of rarest fragrance all the year shall bloom,
And singing birds make music in your chosen room.
Come, breathe its balmy air!
Come, charm away my care,
In the little white cottage on Everygreen Square."

And it's very hard to find.
Surrounding almost changed.
They have flatten with bulldozers all and made skyscrapers around.
A concrete city! But it's situated in the same place.
My old teachers were not there and the belfry hall is very old.
Thatched roof converted to tin sheets and there were few more class rooms.
Mango and Jack-fruit trees no more.

723,Emotion,SchoolPoemsTestsAndHomeworkAndQuizzesAndSchoolPoembyDavidKulczyk,"You know that if there was one thing,
That you could take from school,
It wouldn't be art or math or history,
It would be work.
Those ugly things you want to blow up,

Good that the year's almost over,

And what did you say? We have to take more than one!
I'm done for.
Your sitting there,
hand clenched on the pencil,
face sweating,
and then BINGO!
You get the answer.
You jump up and scream,
in the silent classroom.
You shout out with joy 'cause they’re all over.
No more exams, or quizzes, or tests, or homework.
You bring up you paper and sit back down.
Then it happens.
Excuse me please come up to the front of the room
Right then and there
DETENTION!
No it’s not detention?
Whoo Hoo! ! ! !
It’s homework
Well that’s just as bad.
You think,  No. No. You didn't just say there's still homework? ?
And we have to do it everyday of the summer! !
You have to be kidding me.
“Oh, just strike me down right here and save me from homework! ! “
But wait,
You say it's fun homework,
BLAH,
homework can't be fun,
or joyous,
or exciting,
or awesome,
or amusing,
or entertaining,
JUST HORRIBLE! ! !
“So we have to do fun homework? ? “
“What is it? “
It is to have fun?
And stay safe? ?
“No, you must be kidding.”

725,Emotion,SchoolPoemsOnTheSchoolBusPoembyAlisonCassidy,"She caught the school bus
every day,
Margaret Kennedy,
plain and pigeon-toed.
She chose the same seat
behind the driver
(we liked to sit up the back) .
She'd bury her face in a book,
hiding her freckles under her hat.
She was a school prefect -
a real goody-goody -
who always wore her gloves
and 'reported' us
when we didn't.
She sometimes sucked sweets
which she'd smuggle
surreptitiously
from gloved hand to mouth.
Margaret was a loner -
aloof and without friends.
She was older than us
and we were all a bit scared of her.
One day she missed the bus.
We were told her mum had died
(she'd had cancer apparently) .
She never caught the bus again."

728,Emotion,SchoolPoemsTheOldSchoolGatePoembyANDREWBLAKEMORE,"The old school gate still stands here though
The school has long since gone,
It stands amongst the hedgerow now
And opens for no one,
The school gate leads to nowhere
No one passes through it now,
And it remains so firmly shut
Yet it survived somehow.
Although its frame is rusting well
And crumbling away,
It stands there as a symbol of
A long forgotten day,
A small estate of houses where
The classrooms used to be,
The playground too has vanished now
It breaks my heart to see.
So many times I'd waited here
So many times passed through,
I close my eyes and can recall
The times that I once knew,
The parting and the welcoming
I held my mother's hand,
Beside this gate in front of me
That can now barely stand.
So sad to see it in this state
So many years gone by,
Yet while it lasts my dreams survive
And memories will not die,
The faces of the teachers
And the faces of my friends,
The sight of children playing there
Yet here is where it ends."

If I really used my head
Theres a broken mirror

He never forgets this place
Theres the blue locker
It still looks the same
I open the door
I still see my name."

Waiting for the bell to go. (To go where?)
Why are they all so big, other children?
So noisy? So much at home they
Must have been born in uniform
Lived all their lives in playgrounds
Spent the years inventing games
That don't let me in. Games
That are rough, that swallow you up.
And the railings.
All around, the railings.
Are they to keep out wolves and monsters?
Things that carry off and eat children?
Things you don't take sweets from?
Perhaps they're to stop us getting out
Running away from the lessins. Lessin.
What does a lessin look like?
Sounds small and slimy.
They keep them in the glassrooms.
Whole rooms made out of glass. Imagine.
I wish I could remember my name
Mummy said it would come in useful.
Like wellies. When there's puddles.
Yellowwellies. I wish she was here.
I think my name is sewn on somewhere
Perhaps the teacher will read it for me.

732,Emotion,SchoolPoemsKitchenersSchoolPoembyRudyardKipling,"Being a translation of the song that was made by a Mohammedan schoolmaster of Bengal Infantry (some time on service at Suakim) when he heard that Kitchener was taking money from the English to build a Madrissa for Hubshees -- or a college for the Sudanese.
Oh Hubshee, carry your shoes in your hand and bow your head on your breast!
This is the message of Kitchener who did not break you in jest.
It was permitted to him to fulfil the long-appointed years;
Reaching the end ordained of old over your dead Emirs.
He stamped only before your walls, and the Tomb ye knew was dust:
He gathered up under his armpits all the swords of your trust:
He set a guard on your granaries, securing the weak from the strong:
He said: -- ""Go work the waterwheels that were abolished so long.""
He said: -- ""Go safely, being abased. I have accomplished my vow.""
That was the mercy of Kitchener. Cometh his madness now!
He does not desire as ye desire, nor devise as ye devise:
He is preparing a second host -- an army to make you wise.
Not at the mouth of his clean-lipped guns shall ye learn his name again,
But letter by letter, from Kaf to Kaf, at the mouths of his chosen men.
He has gone back to his own city, not seeking presents or bribes,
But openly asking the English for money to buy you Hakims and scribes.
Knowing that ye are forfeit by battle and have no right to live,
He begs for money to bring you learning -- and all the English give.
It is their treasure -- it is their pleasure -- thus are their hearts inclined:
For Allah created the English mad -- the maddest of all mankind!
They do not consider the Meaning ofThings; they consult not creed nor clan.
Behold, they clap the slave on the back, and behold, he ariseth a man!
They terribly carpet the earth with dead, and before their cannon cool,
They walk unarmed by twos and threes to call the living to school.
How is this reason (which is their reason) to judge a scholar's worth,
By casting a ball at three straight sticks and defending the same with a fourth?
But this they do (which is doubtless a spell) and other matters more strange,
Until, by the operation of years, the hearts of their scholars change:
Till these make come and go great boats or engines upon the rail
(But always the English watch near by to prop them when they fail);
Till these make laws of their own choice and Judges of their
And all the mad English obey the Judges and say that that Law is good.
Certainly they were mad from of old; but I think one new thing,
That the magic whereby they work their magic -- wherefrom their fortunes spring --
May be that they show all peoples their magic and ask no price in return.
Wherefore, since ye are bond to that magic, O Hubshee, make haste and learn!
Certainly also is Kitchener mad. But one sure thing I know --
If he who broke you be minded to teach you, to his Madrissa go!
Go, and carry your shoes in your hand and bow your head on your breast,
For he who did not slay you in sport, he will not teach you in jest."
733,Emotion,SchoolPoemsSchoolPoembyKrystleNewberry,"The room is cold-
I see the sun shine bright outside
I cannot escape the room's tight hold.
The untold rules I must abide
My mind wander not through hills of old.
Can I not see the square root of 63
That number is evil, evil i say
Or that Poe was obsessed with Psyche!
What poet wrote down by the bay?
Work and more work, there goes another tree.
Waiting for the ring of bells
Not the bells that Poe described
But the ones the end of the school day  tells
that tell me when on the bus I'll ride
and home I'll gon- and goodbye I'll yell!"
734,Emotion,SchoolPoems01AFarewellToMySchoolPoembyLubnaSKhan,"It’s  been  twelve  years  in  this  school
And  memories  reign  in  my  heart.
It’s  now  that  I  feel  you,  miss  you,
When  we  are  all  about  to  part.
'Old  order  changeth  yielding
Forth  to  new',  he  said.
To  my  dear  IX  Std. do  something  better,
Better  than  what  we  had.
To  sing  of  you  my  friends  and  teachers,
Of  the  relationship  we  share,
Words  will  merely  describe  them,
Thoughts  of  love  and  care.
To  you  my  teachers  I  express  thanks,
Your  teachings  were  not  mere  words.
They  beautified  and  strengthened  me
And  helped  me  lead  these  sheep  in herds.
And  to  you  my  friends,  my  dearest  friends,
I  wanna  say  nothing.
It’s  only  by  words  of  love  and  silence,
That  I  speak  to  you  and  you  to  me.
And  I  must  thank  all  my  peons
Who  worked  behind  the  scene.
They  swept  my  class  and  dirtied  themselves,
And  yet  remained  unseen.
We  are  leaving  you  my  teachers
And  you  will  go  on  teaching,
And  when you’ll  not  be  there,
Through  us your  lives  will  go  on  existing.
By  and  by  this  life  will  go  on
And  I’ll  cherish  these  moments  shared  with  you.
But  I  don’t  want  these  moments  at  all,
For  in  my  life,  friends!  I  want  you.
Many  new  flowers  will  bloom  in  life
And  many  more  stars  will  shine.
But  without  you  my  dearest  ones
It’ll  be  hard  to  make  those  stars  and  flowers  all mine.
To  live  to  the  expectations  of  you,  my  teachers,
And  friends  your  wishes,  I’ll  try.
Though  amidst  the  chaos  of  my  life
In  silence  my  heart  will  cry.
Thank  you  my  teachers  and  good luck  my  friends
As  we  all  bid  each  other  a  farewell.
I  hope  in  these  twelve  years  of  mine
I  have  fared  well."

I may never see any of you again. I don't want to let go of the many memories we have made.
Yet I know that will not happen as the memories we have created have been engraved on my heart and left a deep impression in my mind.
Your kindness and caring attitude has been an inspiration and so have you, and I look forward to the future where in some distant lifetime we will meet again and relive the old times and the old memories.
This is what makes me cherish the true friends I have now."
736,Emotion,SchoolPoems5SchoolDinnersPoembyDavidThreadgold,"I remember in the fifties, I stayed for my school dinners
At six sided tables, with six chairs to match
I remember on walls, having all the art class winners
Whilst the dinner ladies served our food by batch
I remember lots of water, in a very large glass jug
With a glass for every diner in its place
I remember as I poured, it would give out a sudden glug
Causing droplets that would often hit your face
I remember smelly cabbage, with lots of lumpy mash
A tray sliced up with equal bits of pie
I remember thick brown gravy, it landed with a splash
That could blind you if it got you in the eye
I remember all the puddings, with custard steaming hot
You could only have if finishing your greens
I remember all the groaning as we finished off the lot
And the sickly taste from piles of butter beans
I remember taking turns, to have the custards skin
Had to scrape it off before the stuff would pour
I remember in the fifties, that none of us were thin
As the puddings kept us going back for more

739,Emotion,SchoolPoemsTheFlowerSchoolPoembyRabindranathTagore,"When storm-clouds rumble in the sky and June showers come down.
The moist east wind comes marching over the heath to blow its
bagpipes among the bamboos.
Then crowds of flowers come out of a sudden, from nobody knows
where, and dance upon the grass in wild glee.
Mother, I really think the flowers go to school underground.
They do their lessons with doors shut, and if they want to
come out to play before it is time, their master makes them stand
in a corner.
When the rain come they have their holidays.
Branches clash together in the forest, and the leaves rustle
in the wild wind, the thunder-clouds clap their giant hands and the
flower children rush out in dresses of pink and yellow and white.
Do you know, mother, their home is in the sky, where the stars
are.
Haven't you see how eager they are to get there? Don't you
know why they are in such a hurry?
Of course, I can guess to whom they raise their arms; they
have their mother as I have my own."
740,Emotion,SchoolPoemsTheSchoolMistressInImitationOfSpenserExcerptPoembyWilliamShenstone,"Auditæ voces, vagitus et ingens,Infantunque animæ flentes in limine primo. Virg.ADVERTISEMENT
What particulars in Spenser were imagined most proper for the author's imitationon this occasion, are his language, his simplicity, his manner of description,and a peculiar tenderness of sentiment remarkable throughout his works.
Ah me! full sorely is my heart forlorn,
To think how modest worth neglected lies;
While partial fame doth with her blasts adorn
Such deeds alone, as pride and pomp disguise;
Deeds of ill sort, and mischievous emprize!
Lend me thy clarion, goddess! let me try
To sound the praise of merit, ere it dies;
Such as I oft have chaunced to espy,
Lost in the dreary shades of dull obscurity.
In ev'ry village mark'd with little spire,
Embow'r'd in trees, and hardly known to fame,
There dwells, in lowly shed, and mean attire,
A matron old, whom we school-mistress name;
Who boasts unruly brats with birch to tame;
They grieven sore, in piteous durance pent,
Aw'd by the pow'r of this relentless dame;
And oft-times, on vagaries idly bent,
For unkempt hair, or task unconn'd, are sorely shent.
And all in sight doth rise a birchen tree,
Which learning near her little dome did stowe;
Whilom a twig of small regard to see,
Tho' now so wide its waving branches flow;
And work the simple vassals mickle woe;
For not a wind might curl the leaves that blew,
But their limbs shudder'd, and their pulse beat low;
And, as they look'd, they found their horror grew,
And shap'd it into rods, and tingled at the view.
So have I seen (who has not, may conceive,)
A lifeless phantom near a garden plac'd;
So doth it wanton birds of peace bereave,
Of sport, of song, of pleasure, of repast;
They start, they stare, they wheel, they look aghast:
Sad servitude! such comfortless annoy
May no bold Briton's riper age e'er taste!
Ne superstition clog his dance of joy,
Ne vision empty, vain, his native bliss destroy.
Near to this dome is found a patch so green,
On which the tribe their gambols do display;
And at the door impris'ning board is seen,
Lest weakly wights of smaller size should stray;
Eager, perdie, to bask in sunny day!
The noises intermix'd, which thence resound,
Do learning's little tenement betray:
Where sits the dame, disguis'd in look profound,
And eyes her fairy throng, and turns her wheel around.
Her cap, far whiter than the driven snow,
Emblem right meet of decency does yield:
Her apron dy'd in grain, as blue, I trowe,
As is the hare-bell that adorns the field:
And in her hand, for scepter, she does wield
Tway birchen sprays; with anxious fear entwin'd,
With dark distrust, and sad repentance fill'd;
And stedfast hate, and sharp affliction join'd,
And fury uncontroul'd, and chastisement unkind.
Few but have kenn'd, in semblance meet pourtray'd,
The childish faces of old Eol's train;
Libs, Notus, Auster: these in frowns array'd,
How then would fare or earth, or sky, or main,
Were the stern god to give his slaves the rein?
And were not she rebellious breasts to quell,
And were not she her statutes to maintain,
The cott no more, I ween, were deem'd the cell,
Where comely peace of mind, and decent order dwell.
A russet stole was o'er her shoulders thrown;
A russet kirtle fenc'd the nipping air;
'Twas simple russet, but it was her own;
'Twas her own country bred the flock so fair;
'Twas her own labour did the fleece prepare;
And, sooth to say, her pupils, rang'd around,
Thro' pious awe, did term it passing rare;
For they in gaping wonderment abound,
And think, no doubt, she been the greatest wight on ground
Albeit ne flatt'ry did corrupt her truth,
Ne pompous title did debauch her ear;
Goody, good-woman, gossip, n'aunt, forsooth,
Or dame, the sole additions she did hear;
Yet these she challeng'd, these she held right dear:
Ne would esteem him act as mought behove,
Who should not honour'd eld with these revere:
For never title yet so mean could prove,
But there was eke a mind which did that title love.
One ancient hen she took delight to feed,
The plodding pattern of the busy dame;
Which, ever and anon, impell'd by need,
Into her school, begirt with chickens, came;
Such favour did her past deportment claim:
And, if neglect had lavish'd on the ground
Fragment of bread, she would collect the same;
For well she knew, and quaintly could expound,

741,Emotion,SchoolPoemsTheOldSchoolHouseAtRubyPoembyFrancisDuggan,"In old school house yard at Ruby a dark brown shorthorn cow
And leghorn pullets cackling beneath the cypress bough
This school must hold good memories and memories live somehow
Here in their lunch hour children played but where are those children now? .
The old school room now a tea room has undergone some change
And if past pupil came back here he'd find the place quite strange
Where is the desk he sat at? the blackboard is not there
And time has brought change to Ruby as it has done elsewhere.
The old school house at Ruby a memory of past years
Here Ruby children sang and laughed and shed their fledgeling tears
And do those children of Ruby who now live far away
In dreams return to old school house and Ruby childhood day? .
The old school house at Ruby a memory of the past
And time has brought about some change and time bring change too fast
This school must hold good memories and memories live somehow
Here in their lunch hour children played but where are those children now? ."
742,Emotion,SchoolPoemsAddressToTheScholarsOfTheVillageSchoolOfPoembyWilliamWordsworth,"I come, ye little noisy Crew,
Not long your pastime to prevent;
I heard the blessing which to you
Our common Friend and Father sent.
I kissed his cheek before he died;
And when his breath was fled,
I raised, while kneeling by his side,
His hand:--it dropped like lead.
Your hands, dear Little-ones, do all
That can be done, will never fall
Like his till they are dead.
By night or day blow foul or fair,
Ne'er will the best of all your train
Play with the locks of his white hair,
Or stand between his knees again.
Here did he sit confined for hours;
But he could see the woods and plains,
Could hear the wind and mark the showers
Come streaming down the streaming panes.
Now stretched beneath his grass-green mound
He rests a prisoner of the ground.
He loved the breathing air,
He loved the sun, but if it rise
Or set, to him where now he lies,
Brings not a moment's care.
Alas! what idle words; but take
The Dirge which for our Master's sake
And yours, love prompted me to make.
The rhymes so homely in attire
With learned ears may ill agree,
But chanted by your Orphan Quire
Will make a touching melody.
DIRGE
Mourn, Shepherd, near thy old grey stone;
Thou Angler, by the silent flood;
And mourn when thou art all alone,
Thou Woodman, in the distant wood!
Thou one blind Sailor, rich in joy
Though blind, thy tunes in sadness hum;
And mourn, thou poor half-witted Boy!
Born deaf, and living deaf and dumb.
Thou drooping sick Man, bless the Guide
Who checked or turned thy headstrong youth,
As he before had sanctified
Thy infancy with heavenly truth.
Ye Striplings, light of heart and gay,
Bold settlers on some foreign shore,
Give, when your thoughts are turned this way,
A sigh to him whom we deplore.
For us who here in funeral strain
With one accord our voices raise,
Let sorrow overcharged with pain
Be lost in thankfulness and praise.
And when our hearts shall feel a sting
From ill we meet or good we miss,
May touches of his memory bring
Fond healing, like a mother's kiss.
BY THE SIDE OF THE GRAVE SOME YEARS AFTER
LONG time his pulse hath ceased to beat
But benefits, his gift, we trace--
Expressed in every eye we meet
Round this dear Vale, his native place.
To stately Hall and Cottage rude
Flowed from his life what still they hold,
Light pleasures, every day, renewed;
And blessings half a century old.
Oh true of heart, of spirit gay,
Thy faults, where not already gone
From memory, prolong their stay
For charity's sweet sake alone.
Such solace find we for our loss;
And what beyond this thought we crave
Comes in the promise from the Cross,
Shining upon thy happy grave."
743,Emotion,SchoolPoemsToMyDaughterAsSheGraduatesFromHighSchoolPoembyRoseFalcone,"When you were born it was an instant love affair
I rocked you, swaddled you, sang to you,
Read to you and walked you round and round
We played and learned together.
I held your little hands from your first steps
To the back of the bicycle seat on your first ride
Doctored up scraped knees and bruised egos
Played the Tooth fairy, Easter Bunny and Santa Claus
When life took you through a challenge
I held you in my arms as you cried
We wiped the tears and stood up tall
Ready to face the world again
Late one night when I was awakened by the sounds
Of giggles coming from the adjacent room
I could've be upset that you had woken me
But the sound of your laughter made me smile
You were so late coming home one night
I cried at the thought of something happening to you
I was so angry that you hadn’t called
But upon seeing your beautiful face, all I could be was grateful
Now you’re ready to spread your wings
All of our trials and tribulations are ancient history
Go now my love into the world
Make your mark and shine your light
You have been the source of my greatest joy
From your baby coos to your big girl shoes
Always remember who you are
You have always been my brightest star"
744,Emotion,SchoolPoemsInSchoolDaysPoembyJohnGreenleafWhittier,"Still sits the school-house by the road,
A ragged beggar sleeping;
Around it still the sumachs grow,
And blackberry-vines are creeping.
Within, the master's desk is seen,
Deep-scarred by raps official;
The warping floor, the battered seats,
The jack-knife's carved initial;
The charcoal frescoes on its wall;
Its door's worn sill, betraying
The feet that, creeping slow to school,
Went storming out to playing!
Long years ago a winter sun
Shone over it at setting;
Lit up its western window-panes,
And low eaves' icy fretting.
It touched the tangled golden curls,
And brown eyes full of grieving,
Of one who still her steps delayed
When all the school were leaving.
For near it stood the little boy
Her childish favor singled;
His cap pulled low upon a face
Where pride and shame were mingled.
Pushing with restless feet the snow
To right and left, he lingered;---
As restlessly her tiny hands
The blue-checked apron fingered.
He saw her lift her eyes; he felt
The soft hand's light caressing,
And heard the tremble of her voice,
As if a fault confessing.
""I'm sorry that I spelt the word:
I hate to go above you,
Because,""---the brown eyes lower fell,---
""Because, you see, I love you!""
Still memory to a gray-haired man
That sweet child-face is showing.
Dear girl! the grasses on her grave
Have forty years been growing!
He lives to learn, in life's hard school,
How few who pass above him
Lament their triumph and his loss,
Like her, because they love him."

The alarm woke me up late in the morn
Oh how could this happen?
I’m sure I had set the alarm right, I could have sworn
I was supposed to wake up at seven
But now its nearly eight
If I’m not on time my teacher will kill me
Or else she will use me for fishing as bait
In a total hustle bustle I tried to pack my bag
Oh now where is my math book gone?
And then I also realized I
Had left my pencil box in the lawn
Mom tried to stop me but I was too busy
To hear what she had to say
Without breakfast I ran to bus stop
Whilst the sun on me, cast its many a bright ray
I stood there waiting for my bus
Which always came at eight
But it didn’t arrive at all
Uh oh, was I too late?
At last I gave up hope
And came home to rest for the day
When my eyes fell on the calendar
And I realized today is a Sunday."

Thus violating Belgian neutrality.

And respect this somewhat scattered Principality;

A dropout gets left out
A dropout gets pushed out
Show me your name, what does it mean
Show me your ring, you're in the scene
Without an education there is no beginning
With education you are winning
Stay in school, student maintain your cool
It's so hard to get a job now days
Without education just be on your way
Show me your car, what does it prove?
Show me youe diploma, you're in the groove
You don't have to be smart to finish school
But you are a square if you are not there
Dropout, you can start back
Students that are in school
You are on the right track
You can stand around the corner
Watching the school bus go by
You know deep down inside you want to cry
It is good to stop drinking
It is good to stop smoking
When you are thinking about stopping your education
My friend you better start thinking"

'DON'T BE DUMB STAY IN SCHOOL'"
754,Emotion,SchoolPoemsThePreludeBook2SchoolTimeContinuedPoembyWilliamWordsworth,".  Thus far, O Friend! have we, though leaving much
Unvisited, endeavour'd to retrace
My life through its first years, and measured back
The way I travell'd when I first began
To love the woods and fields; the passion yet
Was in its birth, sustain'd, as might befal,
By nourishment that came unsought, for still,
From week to week, from month to month, we liv'd
A round of tumult: duly were our games
Prolong'd in summer till the day-light fail'd;
No chair remain'd before the doors, the bench
And threshold steps were empty; fast asleep
The Labourer, and the old Man who had sate,
A later lingerer, yet the revelry
Continued, and the loud uproar: at last,
When all the ground was dark, and the huge clouds
Were edged with twinkling stars, to bed we went,
With weary joints, and with a beating mind.
Ah! is there one who ever has been young,
Nor needs a monitory voice to tame
The pride of virtue, and of intellect?
And is there one, the wisest and the best
Of all mankind, who does not sometimes wish
For things which cannot be, who would not give,
If so he might, to duty and to truth
The eagerness of infantine desire?
A tranquillizing spirit presses now
On my corporeal frame: so wide appears
The vacancy between me and those days,
Which yet have such self-presence in my mind
That, sometimes, when I think of them, I seem
Two consciousnesses, conscious of myself
And of some other Being. A grey Stone
Of native rock, left midway in the Square
Of our small market Village, was the home
And centre of these joys, and when, return'd
After long absence, thither I repair'd,
I found that it was split, and gone to build
A smart Assembly-room that perk'd and flar'd
With wash and rough-cast elbowing the ground
Which had been ours. But let the fiddle scream,
And be ye happy! yet, my Friends! I know
That more than one of you will think with me
Of those soft starry nights, and that old Dame
From whom the stone was nam'd who there had sate
And watch'd her Table with its huckster's wares
Assiduous, thro' the length of sixty years.
We ran a boisterous race; the year span round
With giddy motion. But the time approach'd
That brought with it a regular desire
For calmer pleasures, when the beauteous forms
Of Nature were collaterally attach'd
To every scheme of holiday delight,
And every boyish sport, less grateful else,
And languidly pursued.         When summer came
It was the pastime of our afternoons
To beat along the plain of Windermere
With rival oars, and the selected bourne
Was now an Island musical with birds
That sang for ever; now a Sister Isle
Beneath the oaks' umbrageous covert, sown
With lillies of the valley, like a field;
And now a third small Island where remain'd
An old stone Table, and a moulder'd Cave,
A Hermit's history. In such a race,
So ended, disappointment could be none,
Uneasiness, or pain, or jealousy:
We rested in the shade, all pleas'd alike,
Conquer'd and Conqueror. Thus the pride of strength,
And the vain-glory of superior skill
Were interfus'd with objects which subdu'd
And temper'd them, and gradually produc'd
A quiet independence of the heart.
And to my Friend, who knows me, I may add,
Unapprehensive of reproof, that hence
Ensu'd a diffidence and modesty,
And I was taught to feel, perhaps too much,
The self-sufficing power of solitude.
No delicate viands sapp'd our bodily strength;
More than we wish'd we knew the blessing then
Of vigorous hunger, for our daily meals
Were frugal, Sabine fare! and then, exclude
A little weekly stipend, and we lived
Through three divisions of the quarter'd year
In pennyless poverty. But now, to School
Return'd, from the half-yearly holidays,
We came with purses more profusely fill'd,
Allowance which abundantly suffic'd
To gratify the palate with repasts
More costly than the Dame of whom I spake,
That ancient Woman, and her board supplied.
Hence inroads into distant Vales, and long
Excursions far away among the hills,
Hence rustic dinners on the cool green ground,
Or in the woods, or near a river side,
Or by some shady fountain, while soft airs
Among the leaves were stirring, and the sun
Unfelt, shone sweetly round us in our joy.
Nor is my aim neglected, if I tell
How twice in the long length of those half-years
We from our funds, perhaps, with bolder hand
Drew largely, anxious for one day, at least,
To feel the motion of the galloping Steed;
And with the good old Inn-keeper, in truth,
On such occasion sometimes we employ'd
Sly subterfuge; for the intended bound
Of the day's journey was too distant far
For any cautious man, a Structure famed
Beyond its neighbourhood, the antique Walls
Of that large Abbey which within the vale
Of Nightshade, to St. Mary's honour built,
Stands yet, a mouldering Pile, with fractured Arch,
Belfry, and Images, and living Trees,
A holy Scene! along the smooth green turf
Our Horses grazed: to more than inland peace
Left by the sea wind passing overhead
(Though wind of roughest temper) trees and towers
May in that Valley oftentimes be seen,
Both silent and both motionless alike;
Such is the shelter that is there, and such
The safeguard for repose and quietness.
Our steeds remounted, and the summons given,
With whip and spur we by the Chauntry flew
In uncouth race, and left the cross-legg'd Knight,
And the stone-Abbot, and that single Wren
Which one day sang so sweetly in the Nave
Of the old Church, that, though from recent showers
The earth was comfortless, and, touch'd by faint
Internal breezes, sobbings of the place,
And respirations, from the roofless walls
The shuddering ivy dripp'd large drops, yet still,
So sweetly 'mid the gloom the invisible Bird
Sang to itself, that there I could have made
My dwelling-place, and liv'd for ever there
To hear such music. Through the Walls we flew
And down the valley, and a circuit made
In wantonness of heart, through rough and smooth
We scamper'd homeward. Oh! ye Rocks and Streams,
And that still Spirit of the evening air!
Even in this joyous time I sometimes felt
Your presence, when with slacken'd step we breath'd
Along the sides of the steep hills, or when,
Lighted by gleams of moonlight from the sea,
We beat with thundering hoofs the level sand.
Upon the Eastern Shore of Windermere,
Above the crescent of a pleasant Bay,
There stood an Inn, no homely-featured Shed,
Brother of the surrounding Cottages,
But 'twas a splendid place, the door beset
With Chaises, Grooms, and Liveries, and within
Decanters, Glasses, and the blood-red Wine.
In ancient times, or ere the Hall was built
On the large Island, had this Dwelling been
More worthy of a Poet's love, a Hut,
Proud of its one bright fire, and sycamore shade.
But though the rhymes were gone which once inscribed
The threshold, and large golden characters
On the blue-frosted Signboard had usurp'd
The place of the old Lion, in contempt
And mockery of the rustic painter's hand,
Yet to this hour the spot to me is dear
With all its foolish pomp. The garden lay
Upon a slope surmounted by the plain
Of a small Bowling-green; beneath us stood
A grove; with gleams of water through the trees
And over the tree-tops; nor did we want
Refreshment, strawberries and mellow cream.
And there, through half an afternoon, we play'd
On the smooth platform, and the shouts we sent
Made all the mountains ring. But ere the fall
Of night, when in our pinnace we return'd
Over the dusky Lake, and to the beach
Of some small Island steer'd our course with one,
The Minstrel of our troop, and left him there,
And row'd off gently, while he blew his flute
Alone upon the rock; Oh! then the calm
And dead still water lay upon my mind
Even with a weight of pleasure, and the sky
Never before so beautiful, sank down
Into my heart, and held me like a dream.
Thus daily were my sympathies enlarged,
And thus the common range of visible things
Grew dear to me: already I began
To love the sun, a Boy I lov'd the sun,
Not as I since have lov'd him, as a pledge
And surety of our earthly life, a light
Which while we view we feel we are alive;
But, for this cause, that I had seen him lay
His beauty on the morning hills, had seen
The western mountain touch his setting orb,
In many a thoughtless hour, when, from excess
Of happiness, my blood appear'd to flow
With its own pleasure, and I breath'd with joy.
And from like feelings, humble though intense,
To patriotic and domestic love
Analogous, the moon to me was dear;
For I would dream away my purposes,
Standing to look upon her while she hung
Midway between the hills, as if she knew
No other region; but belong'd to thee,
Yea, appertain'd by a peculiar right
To thee and thy grey huts, my darling Vale!
Those incidental charms which first attach'd
My heart to rural objects, day by day
Grew weaker, and I hasten on to tell
How Nature, intervenient till this time,
And secondary, now at length was sought
For her own sake. But who shall parcel out
His intellect, by geometric rules,
Split, like a province, into round and square?
Who knows the individual hour in which
His habits were first sown, even as a seed,
Who that shall point, as with a wand, and say,
'This portion of the river of my mind
Came from yon fountain?' Thou, my Friend! art one
More deeply read in thy own thoughts; to thee
Science appears but, what in truth she is,
Not as our glory and our absolute boast,
But as a succedaneum, and a prop
To our infirmity. Thou art no slave
Of that false secondary power, by which,
In weakness, we create distinctions, then
Deem that our puny boundaries are things
Which we perceive, and not which we have made.
To thee, unblinded by these outward shows,
The unity of all has been reveal'd
And thou wilt doubt with me, less aptly skill'd
Than many are to class the cabinet
Of their sensations, and, in voluble phrase,
Run through the history and birth of each,
As of a single independent thing.
Hard task to analyse a soul, in which,
Not only general habits and desires,
But each most obvious and particular thought,
Not in a mystical and idle sense,
But in the words of reason deeply weigh'd,
Hath no beginning.          Bless'd the infant Babe,
(For with my best conjectures I would trace
The progress of our Being) blest the Babe,
Nurs'd in his Mother's arms, the Babe who sleeps
Upon his Mother's breast, who, when his soul
Claims manifest kindred with an earthly soul,
Doth gather passion from his Mother's eye!
Such feelings pass into his torpid life
Like an awakening breeze, and hence his mind
Even [in the first trial of its powers]
Is prompt and watchful, eager to combine
In one appearance, all the elements
And parts of the same object, else detach'd
And loth to coalesce. Thus, day by day,
Subjected to the discipline of love,
His organs and recipient faculties
Are quicken'd, are more vigorous, his mind spreads,
Tenacious of the forms which it receives.
In one beloved presence, nay and more,
In that most apprehensive habitude
And those sensations which have been deriv'd
From this beloved Presence, there exists
A virtue which irradiates and exalts
All objects through all intercourse of sense.
No outcast he, bewilder'd and depress'd;
Along his infant veins are interfus'd
The gravitation and the filial bond
Of nature, that connect him with the world.
Emphatically such a Being lives,
An inmate of this  active universe;
From nature largely he receives; nor so
Is satisfied, but largely gives again,
For feeling has to him imparted strength,
And powerful in all sentiments of grief,
Of exultation, fear, and joy, his mind,
Even as an agent of the one great mind,
Creates, creator and receiver both,
Working but in alliance with the works
Which it beholds.--Such, verily, is the first
Poetic spirit of our human life;
By uniform control of after years
In most abated or suppress'd, in some,
Through every change of growth or of decay,
Pre-eminent till death.       From early days,
Beginning not long after that first time
In which, a Babe, by intercourse of touch,
I held mute dialogues with my Mother's heart
I have endeavour'd to display the means
Whereby this infant sensibility,
Great birthright of our Being, was in me
Augmented and sustain'd. Yet is a path
More difficult before me, and I fear
That in its broken windings we shall need
The chamois' sinews, and the eagle's wing:
For now a trouble came into my mind
From unknown causes. I was left alone,
Seeking the visible world, nor knowing why.
The props of my affections were remov'd,
And yet the building stood, as if sustain'd
By its own spirit! All that I beheld
Was dear to me, and from this cause it came,
That now to Nature's finer influxes
My mind lay open, to that more exact
And intimate communion which our hearts
Maintain with the minuter properties
Of objects which already are belov'd,
And of those only. Many are the joys
Of youth; but oh! what happiness to live
When every hour brings palpable access
Of knowledge, when all knowledge is delight,
And sorrow is not there. The seasons came,
And every season to my notice brought
A store of transitory qualities
Which, but for this most watchful power of love
Had been neglected, left a register
Of permanent relations, else unknown,
Hence life, and change, and beauty, solitude
More active, even, than 'best society',
Society made sweet as solitude
By silent inobtrusive sympathies,
And gentle agitations of the mind
From manifold distinctions, difference
Perceived in things, where to the common eye,
No difference is; and hence, from the same source
Sublimer joy; for I would walk alone,
In storm and tempest, or in starlight nights
Beneath the quiet Heavens; and, at that time,
Have felt whate'er there is of power in sound
To breathe an elevated mood, by form
Or image unprofaned; and I would stand,
Beneath some rock, listening to sounds that are
The ghostly language of the ancient earth,
Or make their dim abode in distant winds.
Thence did I drink the visionary power.
I deem not profitless those fleeting moods
Of shadowy exultation: not for this,
That they are kindred to our purer mind
And intellectual life; but that the soul,
Remembering how she felt, but what she felt
Remembering not, retains an obscure sense
Of possible sublimity, to which,
With growing faculties she doth aspire,
With faculties still growing, feeling still
That whatsoever point they gain, they still
Have something to pursue.       And not alone,
In grandeur and in tumult, but no less
In tranquil scenes, that universal power
And fitness in the latent qualities
And essences of things, by which the mind
Is mov'd by feelings of delight, to me
Came strengthen'd with a superadded soul,
A virtue not its own. My morning walks
Were early; oft, before the hours of School
I travell'd round our little Lake, five miles
Of pleasant wandering, happy time! more dear
For this, that one was by my side, a Friend
Then passionately lov'd; with heart how full
Will he peruse these lines, this page, perhaps
A blank to other men! for many years
Have since flow'd in between us; and our minds,
Both silent to each other, at this time
We live as if those hours had never been.
Nor seldom did I lift our cottage latch
Far earlier, and before the vernal thrush
Was audible, among the hills I sate
Alone, upon some jutting eminence
At the first hour of morning, when the Vale
Lay quiet in an utter solitude.
How shall I trace the history, where seek
The origin of what I then have felt?
Oft in these moments such a holy calm
Did overspread my soul, that I forgot
That I had bodily eyes, and what I saw
Appear'd like something in myself, a dream,
A prospect in my mind.       'Twere long to tell
What spring and autumn, what the winter snows,
And what the summer shade, what day and night,
The evening and the morning, what my dreams
And what my waking thoughts supplied, to nurse
That spirit of religious love in which
I walked with Nature. But let this, at least
Be not forgotten, that I still retain'd
My first creative sensibility,
That by the regular action of the world
My soul was unsubdu'd. A plastic power
Abode with me, a forming hand, at times
Rebellious, acting in a devious mood,
A local spirit of its own, at war
With general tendency, but for the most
Subservient strictly to the external things
With which it commun'd. An auxiliar light
Came from my mind which on the setting sun
Bestow'd new splendor, the melodious birds,
The gentle breezes, fountains that ran on,
Murmuring so sweetly in themselves, obey'd
A like dominion; and the midnight storm
Grew darker in the presence of my eye.
Hence by obeisance, my devotion hence,
And hence my transport.       Nor should this, perchance,
Pass unrecorded, that I still have lov'd
The exercise and produce of a toil
Than analytic industry to me
More pleasing, and whose character I deem
Is more poetic as resembling more
Creative agency. I mean to speak
Of that interminable building rear'd
By observation of affinities
In objects where no brotherhood exists
To common minds. My seventeenth year was come
And, whether from this habit, rooted now
So deeply in my mind, or from excess
Of the great social principle of life,
Coercing all things into sympathy,
To unorganic natures I transferr'd
My own enjoyments, or, the power of truth
Coming in revelation, I convers'd
With things that really are, I, at this time
Saw blessings spread around me like a sea.
Thus did my days pass on, and now at length
From Nature and her overflowing soul
I had receiv'd so much that all my thoughts
Were steep'd in feeling; I was only then
Contented when with bliss ineffable
I felt the sentiment of Being spread
O'er all that moves, and all that seemeth still,
O'er all, that, lost beyond the reach of thought
And human knowledge, to the human eye
Invisible, yet liveth to the heart,
O'er all that leaps, and runs, and shouts, and sings,
Or beats the gladsome air, o'er all that glides
Beneath the wave, yea, in the wave itself
And mighty depth of waters. Wonder not
If such my transports were; for in all things
I saw one life, and felt that it was joy.
One song they sang, and it was audible,
Most audible then when the fleshly ear,
O'ercome by grosser prelude of that strain,
Forgot its functions, and slept undisturb'd.
If this be error, and another faith
Find easier access to the pious mind,
Yet were I grossly destitute of all
Those human sentiments which make this earth
So dear, if I should fail, with grateful voice
To speak of you, Ye Mountains and Ye Lakes,
And sounding Cataracts! Ye Mists and Winds
That dwell among the hills where I was born.
If, in my youth, I have been pure in heart,
If, mingling with the world, I am content
With my own modest pleasures, and have liv'd,
With God and Nature communing, remov'd
From little enmities and low desires,
The gift is yours; if in these times of fear,
This melancholy waste of hopes o'erthrown,
If, 'mid indifference and apathy
And wicked exultation, when good men,
On every side fall off we know not how,
To selfishness, disguis'd in gentle names
Of peace, and quiet, and domestic love,
Yet mingled, not unwillingly, with sneers
On visionary minds; if in this time
Of dereliction and dismay, I yet
Despair not of our nature; but retain
A more than Roman confidence, a faith
That fails not, in all sorrow my support,
The blessing of my life, the gift is yours,
Ye mountains! thine, O Nature! Thou hast fed
My lofty speculations; and in thee,
For this uneasy heart of ours I find
A never-failing principle of joy,
And purest passion.       Thou, my Friend! wert rear'd
In the great City, 'mid far other scenes;
But we, by different roads at length have gain'd
The self-same bourne. And for this cause to Thee
I speak, unapprehensive of contempt,
The insinuated scoff of coward tongues,
And all that silent language which so oft
In conversation betwixt man and man
Blots from the human countenance all trace
Of beauty and of love. For Thou hast sought
The truth in solitude, and Thou art one,
The most intense of Nature's worshippers
In many things my Brother, chiefly here
In this my deep devotion.       Fare Thee well!
Health, and the quiet of a healthful mind
Attend thee! seeking oft the haunts of men,
And yet more often living with Thyself,
And for Thyself, so haply shall thy days
Be many, and a blessing to mankind."

Finding refuge in burial soil of a promised land.
An opened petal soon dies;
Come spring the bulb revives.
A vine clinging to her mother’s dress,
Her fists budded into her mother-haven,
Crying tears of distress,
Running waters streaking her cheeks.
Unparted waters to the promised land,
Unbinding the clasping hands,
To walk through the parted sea,
Tears of baptism, tears of rebirth,
running waters streaking her cheeks.

The truth will make them free;
But how to see and understand
That beyond the fear we will be free.

756,Emotion,SchoolPoemsSchoolRhymesPoembyJamesClerkMaxwell,"O academic muse that hast for long
Charmed all the world with thy disciples’ song,
As myrtle bushes must give place to trees,
Our humbler strains can now no longer please.
Look down for once, inspire me in these lays.
In lofty verse to sing our Rector's praise.
The mighty wheel of Time to light has rolled
That golden age by ancient bards foretold.
Minerva now descends upon our land,
And scatters knowledge with unsparing hand;
Long since Ulysses saw the heavenly maid,
In Mentor's form and Mentor’s dress arrayed,
But now to Cambrian lands the goddess flies,
And drops in Williams’ form from out the skies;
And as at dawn the brilliant orb of light,
With his bright beams dispels the gloomy night,
So sunk in ignorance our land he finds,
But with his learning drives it from our minds,
And he, a hero, shall with joyful eyes
See crowds of heroes all around him rise;
With great Minerva's wisdom he shall rule
Those boisterous youths—the rector's class at school,
And when in the fifth class begins his power,
And he begins to teach us, from that hour
Dame Poetry begins to show her face,
And witty epigrams the plaster grace;
There growing wild are often to be seen
The names of boys that Duxes erst have been,
And at the chimney-piece is seen the same
All thickly scribbled with the boobie's name.

Ne’er shall the dreadful tawse be heard again,
The lash resounding, and the cry of pain;
Carmichael's self will change (O that he would!)
From the imperative to wishing mood;
Ye years roll on, and haste the expected time
When flogging boys shall be accounted crime.
But come, thy real nature let us see,
No more the rector but the goddess be,
Come in thy might and shake the deep profound,
Let the Academy with shouts resound,
While radiant glory all thy head adorns,
And slippers on thy feet protect thy corns;
O may I live so long on earth below,
That I may learn the things that thou dost know!
Then will I praise thee in heroic verse
So good that Linus’ will be counted worse;
The Thracian Orpheus never will compare
With me, nor Dods that got the prize last year.
But stay, O stay upon this earth a while,
Even now thou seest the world's approving smile,
And when thou goest to taste celestial joys,
Let thy great nephew teach the mourning boys,
Then mounting to the skies upon the wind,
Lead captive ignorance in chains behind."
757,Emotion,SchoolPoemsTheVillageSchoolMasterPoembyRajaramRamachandran,"It was a remote village,
A school teacher single,
With boys of assorted age,
Had to manage and tackle.
'Boys, Inspector, any time,
To inspect the school,
Is expected to come,
Be smart, ready and cool.'
'He may, perhaps, ask you,
The shape of the world,
My snuff box, all of you
See how it is round.'
'I'll keep it on my table,
For your remembrance here,
One of you should be able
To answer, have no fear.'
Suddenly on a Sunday,
Knowing it was a holiday,
He came to inspect, on his way
To his own village nearby.
The teacher rang the bell.
The boys were puzzled.
It was short of a hell,
To have them assembled.
Boys with unkempt hair,
Boys with soiled dress,
Boys with faces poor,
Took their seats in the class.
The teacher in a hurry,
Kept a square snuff box,
And was feeling sorry,
To miss his round box.
The boys, as expected,
Heard the same query
With their hands raised,
Kept the answer ready.
Up one of them stood,
And promptly he said,
'Square on all Sundays
And round on other days.'"

760,Emotion,SchoolPoemsTheJourneyFromSchoolAndToSchoolPoembyCharlesLamb,"O what a joyous joyous day
Is that on which we come
At the recess from school away,
Each lad to his own home!
What though the coach is crammëd full,
The weather very warm;
Think you a boy of us is dull,
Or feels the slightest harm?
The dust and sun is life and fun;
The hot and sultry weather
A higher zest gives every breast,
Thus jumbled all together.
Sometimes we laugh aloud, aloud,
Sometimes huzzah, huzzah.
Who is so buoyant, free, and proud
As we home travellers are?
But sad, but sad is every lad
That day on which we come,
That last last day on which away
We all come from our home.
The coach too full is found to be;
Why is it crammëd thus?
Now every one can plainly see
There's not half room for us.
Soon we exclaim, O shame, O shame,
This hot and sultry weather,
Who but our master is to blame
Who packed us thus together!
Now dust and sun does every one
Most terribly annoy;
Complaints begun, soon every one
Elbows his neighbour boy.
Not now the joyous laugh goes round,
We shout not now huzzah;
A sadder group may not be found
Than we returning are."

First Day at School
A millionbillionwillion miles from home
Waiting for the bell to go. (To go where?)
Why are they all so big, other children?
So noisy? So much at home they
Must have been born in uniform
Lived all their lives in playgrounds
Spent the years inventing games
That don't let me in. Games
That are rough, that swallow you up.
And the railings.
All around, the railings.
Are they to keep out wolves and monsters?
Things that carry off and eat children?
Things you don't take sweets from?
Perhaps they're to stop us getting out
Running away from the lessins. Lessin.
What does a lessin look like?
Sounds small and slimy.
They keep them in the glassrooms.
Whole rooms made out of glass. Imagine.
I wish I could remember my name
Mummy said it would come in useful.
Like wellies. When there's puddles.

Perhaps the teacher will read it for me.

764,Emotion,SchoolPoemsASchoolSongPoembyRudyardKipling,"Prelude to ""Stalky & Co.""
""Let us now praise famous men""--
Men of little showing--
For their work continueth,
And their work continueth,
Broad and deep continues,
Greater then their knowing!
Western wind and open surge
Took us from our mothers--
Flung us on a naked shore
(Twelve bleak houses by the shore.
Seven summers by the shore! )
'Mid two hundred brothers.
There we met with famous men
Set in office o'er us;
And they beat on us with rods--
Faithfully with many rods--
Daily beat us on with rods,
For the love they bore us!
Out of Egypt unto Troy--
Over Himalaya--
Far and sure our bands have gone--
Hy-Brazil or Babylon,
Islands of the Southern Run,
And Cities of Cathaia!
And we all praise famous men--
Ancients of the College;
For they taught us common sense--
Tried to teach us common sense--
Truth and God's Own Common Sense,
Which is more than knowledge!
Each degree of Latitude
Strung about Creation
Seeth one or more of us
(Of one muster each of us),
Diligent in that he does,
Keen in his vocation.
This we learned from famous men,
Knowing not its uses,
When they showed, in daily work--
Man must finish off his work--
Right or wrong, his daily work--
And without excuses.
Servant of the Staff and chain,
Mine and fuse and grapnel--
Some, before the face of Kings,
Stand before the face of Kings;
Bearing gifts to divers Kings--
Gifts of case and shrapnel.
This we learned from famous men
Teaching in our borders,
Who declared it was best,
Safest, easiest, and best--
Expeditious, wise, and best--
To obey your orders.
Some beneath the further stars
Bear the greater burden:
Set to serve the lands they rule,
(Save he serve no man may rule),
Serve and love the lands they rule;
Seeking praise nor guerdon.
This we learned from famous men,
Knowing not we learned it.
Only, as the years went by--
Lonely, as the years went by--
Far from help as years went by,
Plainer we discerned it.
Wherefore praise we famous men
From whose bays we borrow--
They that put aside To-day--
All the joys of their To-day--
And with toil of their To-day
Bought for us To-morrow!
Bless and praise we famous men--
Men of little showing--
For their work continueth,
And their work continueth,
Broad and deep continueth,
Great beyond their knowing!"
765,Emotion,SchoolPoemsTheOldSchoolListPoembyJamesKennethStephen,"In a wild moraine of forgotten books,
On the glacier of years gone by,
As I plied my rake for order's sake,
There was one that caught my eye:
And I sat by the shelf till I lost myself.
And roamed in the crowded mist,
And heard lost voices and saw lost looks,
As I pored on an Old School List.
What a jumble of names! there were some that I knew,
As a brother is known: to-day
Gone I know not where, nay I hardly care,
For their places are full: and, they--
What climes they have ranged: how much they're changed!
Time, place and pursuits assist
In transforming them: stay where you are: adieu!
You are all in the Old School List.
There are some who did nothing at school, much since:
And others much then, since naught:
They are middle-aged men, grown bald since then:
Some have travelled, and some have fought:
And some have written, and some are bitten
With strange new faiths: desist
From tracking them: broker or priest of prince,
They are all in the Old School List.
There's a grave grey lawyer in King's Bench Walk,
Whose clients are passing few:
He seldom speaks: in those lonely weeks,
What on earth can he find to do?
Well, he stroked the eight -- what a splendid fate!--
And the Newcastle barely missed:
""A future Lord Chancellor!"" so we'd talk
In the days of the old School List.
There were several duffers and several bores,
Whose faces I've half forgot,
Whom I lived among, when the world was young,
And who talked ""no end of rot"":
Are they now little clerks who stroll in the Parks
Or scribble with grimy fist,
Or rich little peers who hire Scotch moors?
Well -- they're all in the old School List.
There were some who were certain to prosper and thrive,
And certain to do no more,
Who were ""capital chaps,"" and, tho' moderate saps,
Would never stay in after four:
Now day after day they are packed away,
After being connubially kissed,
To work in the city from ten to five:
There they are in the old School List.
There were two good fellows I used to know.
--How distant it all appears!
We played together in football weather,
And messed together for years:
Now one of them's wed, and the other's dead
So long that he's hardly missed
Save by us, who messed with him years ago:
But we're all in the old School List."
766,Emotion,SchoolPoemsGoingBackToSchoolPoembyStephenVincentBenet,"The boat ploughed on. Now Alcatraz was past
And all the grey waves flamed to red again
At the dead sun's last glimmer. Far and vast
The Sausalito lights burned suddenly
In little dots and clumps, as if a pen
Had scrawled vague lines of gold across the hills;
The sky was like a cup some rare wine fills,
And stars came as he watched
-- and he was free
One splendid instant -- back in the great room,
Curled in a chair with all of them beside
And the whole world a rush of happy voices,
With laughter beating in a clamorous tide. . . .
Saw once again the heat of harvest fume
Up to the empty sky in threads like glass,
And ran, and was a part of what rejoices
In thunderous nights of rain; lay in the grass
Sun-baked and tired, looking through a maze
Of tiny stems into a new green world;
Once more knew eves of perfume, days ablaze
With clear, dry heat on the brown, rolling fields;
Shuddered with fearful ecstasy in bed
Over a book of knights and bloody shields . . .
The ship slowed, jarred and stopped. There, straight ahead,
Were dock and fellows. Stumbling, he was whirled
Out and away to meet them -- and his back
Slumped to the old half-cringe, his hands fell slack;
A big boy's arm went round him -- and a twist
Sent shattering pain along his tortured wrist,
As a voice cried, a bloated voice and fat,
""Why it's Miss Nancy! Come along, you rat!"""

one bold stroke from right to left
diagonally downward and stood back
to ask, looking as always at no one
in particular, ""What have I done?""
From the back of the room Freddie

""What have I done?"" he repeated.
The most intellectual students
looked down to study their desks
except for Gertrude Bimmler, who raised
her hand before she spoke. ""M. Degas,
you have created the hypotenuse
of an isosceles triangle."" Degas mused.
Everyone knew that Gertrude could not
be incorrect. ""It is possible,""
Louis Warshowsky added precisely,
""that you have begun to represent

that it was exactly twenty minutes
past eleven, and I thought at worst
this would go on another forty
minutes. It was early April,
the snow had all but melted on

in the new winds, and I believed
that before I knew it I'd be

pursed his lips, and the room
stilled until the long hand

774,Emotion,SchoolPoemsMyFirstDayInSchoolPoembyJayPNarain,"More than half a century ago,
the Monsoon showers had just brought relief from the sweltering summer,
just when I was dreaming of playing soccer whole day outdoors,
My Dad decided that I have to attend an elementary school.
I was dragged a mile by my older brother to my new school,
It would be my favorite Durga Temple  converted into a school,
My dreams of a class with benches and chairs just vanished,
As we were sitting on the floor in open partitioned classrooms of the school.
I thought I would get a nice colorful uniform to wear to school,
but it looked like that the dress code was a futuristic dream,
At least every class had a black board bigger than my slate,
the teacher had a duster whereas I had to wipe the chalk with my hand.
The fear of some burly kids and nostalgia of home made me sad and homesick,
I could not stop crying and asking my teacher to let me go home.
I still remember the teacher with big black cane,
every time I cried to go home, I got a whack on my palm with his cane,
I could not stop crying, he would not stop whacking,
till I was sent in a distant corner for breaking the class rule.
Kneeling down in the corner, I dreamt of Mom and home,
I found comfort in the memories of joyous Durga Puja days,
I wished the Goddess would come alive,
and pierce the hands of the teacher with her big spear.
Finally the Tiffin time heralded the temporary recess,
the teacher came down and helped me open my Tiffin can,
He asked me to eat while he wrote something on my slate,
He hoped that it would keep me interested in his school.
After I finished my food, he handed my slate,
He had drawn a picture of a big smiling cat with whiskers and big tail,
He asked me to draw the cat on the other side of the slate,
I was so happy drawing the circles and lines whole afternoon,
I forgot I had a rough first day in school."
775,Emotion,SchoolPoemsOThePressuresOfSchoolPoembyFidelisPatronus,"O the pressures of school
It is so heavy I feel like a mule
Slave everyday
I do not want to stay
O the pressures of school
The teachers know everything
And we know nothing
Choosing is not a choice
We are taught to be successful from people who are not
Just wish to be and wish us to be
But they know most of us will fail
Because we will bail
And live in jail
So we can tell our tale
Of how badly we wanted to prevail
But the pressures of school were too great
I don’t think they remember what its like to be in high school
Don’t they remember the pressures from their teachers to be better?
From there students to do drugs and smoke?
To choose to do shit that makes pressures go away but bring some different pressures?
At least we have a choice to do that shit
I think that’s where kids get caught
Choice, freedom, rebel…
Sweet sounds for a teenager worth the price
We hold the dice when it comes to these decisions
Finally we can control something
We are our own bosses
Yes we may loose
But lucky seven
Will take us to heaven
It is not easy finishing school
We are also just starting our complicated lives
Yes we need some guidance
But we don’t need to be on a choke hold
We don’t want to do what we’re told
We have pressures from society
From our family
From the academy
Hell we even have pressures from the TV!
Yet they still don’t see the large burden they put on our shoulders
They think, ‘what can some more pressure do?
Besides this pressure is good for you.’
All I want to do is write poetry
It is my drug
So I don’t have the pressures of taking drugs
It is my addiction
So I don’t need any smokes
It is in my family
So I don’t need pressures from my family
It is even my TV
So I don’t need a TV
So I can tell myself how I am supposed to look and how I am supposed to live my life
It is all I want from school
I know my English and I know how I feel
So I don’t need the pressures of school
All you need to be a poet
Is to turn your feelings into words
You don’t have to be successful
As long as it feeds you’re own pressures rather than the pressures of society
Yet O the pressures of school are so great
I cannot escape
Until their pressures are obliterate"

778,Emotion,SchoolPoemsGoingToANewSchoolPoembyamansbho,"Going to a new school somewhere I never went,
This couldn't happen to me, this I never even dreamt
Thoughts line up in my head,
The ones that I truly dread
How might my new class mates be
Would they pick on me,
Or would they tease me
How many times did my mother tell me to stay strong,
That only the things in your head are what make you act wrong,
And also that things change due to the way we think,
Great things can suddenly be destructed under the rate of a blink,
Just because the way we thought was not  right or just.
I know better, to stay strong and happy,
But that cannot possibly happen under all this anxiety.
How can I suddenly move out of a place,
Which was like a home to me
Now I might fall into a rat race,
Where I might find no one like me
My former school suddenly seems like the best place now,
Although things weren’t great at first I know that that is a place I truly love,
I had taken a very long time to adjust and make friends,
All that has completely gone waste, now that no one will come to save me even once
But things won’t get that worse I now seem to realize
If someone does hurt me I can pay deaf ears and close my eyes
I decide to make the first move while making new friends
Hey maybe it won’t be as bad I thought, I might even set new trends."
779,Emotion,SchoolPoemsTheGreatHerosOurSchoolTeachersPoembyRaviSathasivam,"Those school days, when I was a student
Remembering my days with my wonderful teachers
Teaching lessons for us was not difficult for them
But learning lessons from them was a tough task of our life
They taught us the best and we gained the best
Our mistakes were dealt with understandings
Our mischievous were forgiven and directed us to right path
But the discipline was maintained well from top to bottom
They behaved as teachers and also dear friends
They accepted our respect but also our love to them
They imparted knowledge which was rich in quality
Not only they took care of our studies but also our future career
We knew someday we have to say goodbye
to them with broken heart
But we always remember those fond memories spent with them
Let me thank God for giving us wonderful teachers
during our school days

780,Emotion,SchoolPoemsTheJuniorHighSchoolBandConcertPoembyDavidWagoner,"When our semi-conductor
Raised his baton, we sat there
Gaping at Marche Militaire,
Our mouth-opening number.
It seemed faintly familiar
(We'd rehearsed it all that winter),
But we attacked in such a blur,
No army anywhere
On its stomach or all fours
Could have squeezed through our crossfire.
I played cornet, seventh chair,
Out of seven, my embouchure
A glorified Bronx cheer
Through that three-keyed keyhole stopper
And neighborhood window-slammer
Where mildew fought for air
At every exhausted corner,
My fingering still unsure
After scaling it for a year
Except on the spit-valve lever.
Each straight-faced mother and father
Retested his moral fiber
Against our traps and slurs
And the inadvertent whickers
Paradiddled by our snares,
And when the brass bulled forth
A blare fit to horn over
Jericho two bars sooner
Than Joshua's harsh measures,
They still had the nerve to stare.
By the last lost chord, our director
Looked older and soberer.
No doubt, in his mind's ear
Some band somewhere
In some music of some Sphere
Was striking a note as pure
As the wishes of Franz Schubert,
But meanwhile here we were:
A lesson in everything minor,
Decomposing our first composer."
781,Emotion,SchoolPoemsTheFoolFromSchoolPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"It  now is time.
I'll have to tell the world.
And never did I ever
mean to do this.
Regardless of,
what peers today
require,
I will come out.
The girl I love is
no one you would know.
She is the sweetest,
loveliest of all.
She walks around
as if the world could
well ignore her.
I am afraid,
I tell you with
reluctance,
that someone bigger,
better, smarter comes along.
And takes her on his horse
to distant fields,
she would forget
her home,
and me the
fool from school.
What do you think?
She loves me and
I love her.
Would all this count enough
to seal
our pact forever?"
782,Emotion,SchoolPoemsSchoolTimePoembyjibinjoseph,"My teacher asks me to study
Get up early every morning
Time table for each day
Plan your things as it says
As my school reopened
New books and a clean slate
Books covered and labeled
White cloth and chalk for the slate
How neatly I wrote my name
Drew a picture in the front page
Wanted it to remain the same
Never teared a single page
I was studious had an aim
Colourful marks I scored in test
With friends we played few games
In every game we were the best
Then as the days go by
Started to tear pages from the books
Then said the books a brief bye bye
Dog ears in all my books
Pages used for a million other things
Paper rockets to fly at friends
Wrote the names on their wings
Painted red at the rocket ends
Played in water on rainy days
Plastic shoes and pink raincoats
Prayed for fever on test days
In water sailed paper boats
Now its time for the big exams
No more playgrounds and fun days
Back to books to clear exams
Once again early rise each day"
783,Emotion,SchoolPoemsMyHighSchoolChoirPoembyHerbertNehrlich,"It was expected to belong.
A boy who has his sights
aimed high,
who aims to make
his parents proud,
will show respectability
and rise above the common folks.
It was the driving force
that made me join the choir,
a voice of mediocre quality
would not disgrace the school
as it was mixed into the crowd
of screaming baritones,
of pubescent basses and the lone
and rather spindly looking pallor
who, as a rarity, was an essential tenor.
When teenage vocal cords perform,
there is an awe that settles in the hall,
or auditorium, it clings to dusty walls
and rests among the cobwebs of the past.
And hearts pick up their happy beat
as if to shout about their sheer invincibility,
each ear, as it partakes  the sum of all,
of loud, angelic voices oh, so pure,
claims ownership of the collage of tones
impressed and stirred to greater deeds,
while restless eyes now roam, subdued
search rows of colleagues in the amber light
until they find that pair of mellow molecules,
look back into the innocence of all,
and tiny promises now sing a melody."
784,Emotion,SchoolPoemsAnOldSchoolValentinePoembyLindaWinchell,"I found an old country Cowboy Valentine
that was made so very long ago.
It was signed at the bottom in crayon
by a young boy who's name was, Buffalo Joe.
You could tell it was all hand made
some of the glitter and bangles have fallen off.
Colored with bright colors so neatly
Better than any in a store, one could have bought.
Tried to picture the face that made it
tried as hard as I could ever do.
But for as hard as I had tried to remember
I couldn't grasp that vision of you.
Those were the days of less worries
and a childs heart now just memories.
'Will Ya be My Valentines Partner? '
In that Valentines card you made for me."

786,Emotion,SchoolPoems009MySchoolConductsAthleticMeetPoembyRishaAhmed12yrs,"Here comes another year
While the old one goes by
Bringing with it new events
In which loads of fun lie
We present the national athletic meet
A great event for athletic lovers
A chance for the athletes to
Show off their skills and powers
Athletes come from all over the country
And from abroad too
Cochin has never seen an event
Of such great magnitude
When the athletes enter the stadium
They are greeted with a din and roar
While their coaches give pep talk and say
If you do well, you will get more
The athletes flex their muscles
Just to warm up before the race
And to make sure they don’t fall asleep
They sometimes slap their face
The field referee blows the whistle and
“On your mark, get set go”, he screams
All eyes are on the athletes
No one dare dreams
There are races, javelin throw
High jump and long jump too
And even an event called shot put
That’ll certainly amaze you
So, sit back, and enjoy
As the athletes speed through the events fast
And I assure you these memories
Your whole life will last."

What became of you

Many of you
I never saw again,
or even thought of
until I saw this picture,
yet you occupy a place
that can't be filled
by anyone but you —
so much yourselves,
untrained as yet
in putting on a face.
Your faces are colors
long forgotten,
your names sound notes

Harvey Baer, Gail Rutherford,
Marion Phipps, Jonathon Katz,
Temmy Goldwasser, Randy Wahl —

tolling the music of the spheres."
788,Emotion,SchoolPoemsAgonyOfSchoolPoembyCoryCalder,"I walk through life,
Day-by-day.
Full of never-ending strife,
Void of my say.
The butt of every joke,
In every way.
They always poke,
Are you gay?
I’m sick of the pranks.
Sometimes I just want,
To attack them with shanks.
For each little taunt.
I dare not try nor tell,
They would just run and squeal.
Worsening this living hell,
Of no appeal.
Only I would be at fault.
They are like a toon,
Never coming to a halt.
I wish it would end soon.
Stupid is a good word,
Childish too.
To describe this absurd,
torture I go through.
They act like jerks,
Yet they have girlfriends.
They enjoy the perks,
And don’t care of the ends.
I’m civil and nice,
But always alone.
Free of any vice,
Yet I’m on my own.
If you can’t be good,
Then let me be.
Maybe someday you could,
From my side, see."
789,Emotion,SchoolPoems0034GoingToSchoolToRilkePoembyMichaelShepherd,"We could not have counted on it,
those days when we were children young in years
but rich with a thousand hopes
jostling, pushed aside, forgotten in a day,
turned over in the mind in those few savoured moments
before a happy-tired sleep
nor did we think even to hope for it
or think how it would be to squeeze the honey of it
between our palms into our ready mouths
leaving the wax upon our hands and laughing
together or alone, in rainbow solitude
but now it’s here, we can savour the honey of it,
the future which we could not have had before
the days and years had closed like inexorable cupped petals,
into a summer evening’s sun-hazed past –
we could not have hoped or counted on nor dreamed -
these days when, all required work now done,
life’s evening hours and the late and lazy
golden leisure of fruit-filled autumn branches
stretches out in even though not endless measure –
today I choose to go to school to Rilke,
a choice as free as we think the birds are free,
the animals, the trees – yet know so little,
so very little, of their life –
and pick up the book of his poems at blissful random,
and read one single line –
‘I have great faith in all things not yet spoken’ –
and sit here, as the world falls, gently, as somewhere far away,
the book silent between my hands, having spoken,
like a honeycomb holding the honey
of some new, untrodden, unbelievably rich life."

791,Emotion,SchoolPoemsSeptemberTheFirstDayOfSchoolPoembyHowardNemerov,"I
My child and I hold hands on the way to school,
And when I leave him at the first-grade door
He cries a little but is brave; he does
Let go. My selfish tears remind me how
I cried before that door a life ago.
I may have had a hard time letting go.
Each fall the children must endure together
What every child also endures alone:
Learning the alphabet, the integers,
Three dozen bits and pieces of a stuff
So arbitrary, so peremptory,
That worlds invisible and visible
Bow down before it, as in Joseph's dream
The sheaves bowed down and then the stars bowed down
Before the dreaming of a little boy.
That dream got him such hatred of his brothers
As cost the greater part of life to mend,
And yet great kindness came of it in the end.
II
A school is where they grind the grain of thought,
And grind the children who must mind the thought.
It may be those two grindings are but one,
As from the alphabet come Shakespeare's Plays,
As from the integers comes Euler's Law,
As from the whole, inseperably, the lives,
The shrunken lives that have not been set free
By law or by poetic phantasy.
But may they be. My child has disappeared
Behind the schoolroom door. And should I live
To see his coming forth, a life away,
I know my hope, but do not know its form
Nor hope to know it. May the fathers he finds
Among his teachers have a care of him
More than his father could. How that will look
I do not know, I do not need to know.
Even our tears belong to ritual.
But may great kindness come of it in the end.
Anonymous submission."
792,Emotion,SchoolPoemsSchoolDropoutPoembyLovinaSylviaChidi,"He never went to school
But he was no fool
He was simply playing Mr Cool
Eyes closed by cottonwool
Cheered on my mates
Sealed his present faith
There is a time to play
A time to go to school
His parents told him
Make that your number one rule
He wholly ignored them
How can education
be a such golden gem
Now he sobs, sobs, sobs
Now he robs, robs, robs
No qualifications
Zero education
His mates have moved on
to better jobs
In many glorious nations
Now he sobs, sobs, sobs
Now he robs, robs, robs
He wishes he was a student
He wishes he had the talent
He had at one moment
There are no more screams and shouts
Because he knows what he is all about
He is a school dropout

793,Emotion,SchoolPoemsThePreludeBook1ChildhoodAndSchoolTimePoembyWilliamWordsworth,"--Was it for this
That one, the fairest of all Rivers, lov'd
To blend his murmurs with my Nurse's song,
And from his alder shades and rocky falls,
And from his fords and shallows, sent a voice
That flow'd along my dreams? For this, didst Thou,
O Derwent! travelling over the green Plains
Near my 'sweet Birthplace', didst thou, beauteous Stream
Make ceaseless music through the night and day
Which with its steady cadence, tempering
Our human waywardness, compos'd my thoughts
To more than infant softness, giving me,
Among the fretful dwellings of mankind,
A knowledge, a dim earnest, of the calm
That Nature breathes among the hills and groves.
When, having left his Mountains, to the Towers
Of Cockermouth that beauteous River came,
Behind my Father's House he pass'd, close by,
Along the margin of our Terrace Walk.
He was a Playmate whom we dearly lov'd.
Oh! many a time have I, a five years' Child,
A naked Boy, in one delightful Rill,
A little Mill-race sever'd from his stream,
Made one long bathing of a summer's day,
Bask'd in the sun, and plunged, and bask'd again
Alternate all a summer's day, or cours'd
Over the sandy fields, leaping through groves
Of yellow grunsel, or when crag and hill,
The woods, and distant Skiddaw's lofty height,
Were bronz'd with a deep radiance, stood alone
Beneath the sky, as if I had been born
On Indian Plains, and from my Mother's hut
Had run abroad in wantonness, to sport,
A naked Savage, in the thunder shower.
Fair seed-time had my soul, and I grew up
Foster'd alike by beauty and by fear;
Much favour'd in my birthplace, and no less
In that beloved Vale to which, erelong,
I was transplanted. Well I call to mind
('Twas at an early age, ere I had seen
Nine summers) when upon the mountain slope
The frost and breath of frosty wind had snapp'd
The last autumnal crocus, 'twas my joy
To wander half the night among the Cliffs
And the smooth Hollows, where the woodcocks ran
Along the open turf. In thought and wish
That time, my shoulder all with springes hung,
I was a fell destroyer. On the heights
Scudding away from snare to snare, I plied
My anxious visitation, hurrying on,
Still hurrying, hurrying onward; moon and stars
Were shining o'er my head; I was alone,
And seem'd to be a trouble to the peace
That was among them. Sometimes it befel
In these night-wanderings, that a strong desire
O'erpower'd my better reason, and the bird
Which was the captive of another's toils
Became my prey; and, when the deed was done
I heard among the solitary hills
Low breathings coming after me, and sounds
Of undistinguishable motion, steps
Almost as silent as the turf they trod.
Nor less in springtime when on southern banks
The shining sun had from his knot of leaves
Decoy'd the primrose flower, and when the Vales
And woods were warm, was I a plunderer then
In the high places, on the lonesome peaks
Where'er, among the mountains and the winds,
The Mother Bird had built her lodge. Though mean
My object, and inglorious, yet the end
Was not ignoble. Oh! when I have hung
Above the raven's nest, by knots of grass
And half-inch fissures in the slippery rock
But ill sustain'd, and almost, as it seem'd,
Suspended by the blast which blew amain,
Shouldering the naked crag; Oh! at that time,
While on the perilous ridge I hung alone,
With what strange utterance did the loud dry wind
Blow through my ears! the sky seem'd not a sky
Of earth, and with what motion mov'd the clouds!
The mind of Man is fram'd even like the breath
And harmony of music. There is a dark
Invisible workmanship that reconciles
Discordant elements, and makes them move
In one society. Ah me! that all
The terrors, all the early miseries
Regrets, vexations, lassitudes, that all
The thoughts and feelings which have been infus'd
Into my mind, should ever have made up
The calm existence that is mine when I
Am worthy of myself! Praise to the end!
Thanks likewise for the means! But I believe
That Nature, oftentimes, when she would frame
A favor'd Being, from his earliest dawn
Of infancy doth open out the clouds,
As at the touch of lightning, seeking him
With gentlest visitation; not the less,
Though haply aiming at the self-same end,
Does it delight her sometimes to employ
Severer interventions, ministry
More palpable, and so she dealt with me.
One evening (surely I was led by her)
I went alone into a Shepherd's Boat,
A Skiff that to a Willow tree was tied
Within a rocky Cave, its usual home.
'Twas by the shores of Patterdale, a Vale
Wherein I was a Stranger, thither come
A School-boy Traveller, at the Holidays.
Forth rambled from the Village Inn alone
No sooner had I sight of this small Skiff,
Discover'd thus by unexpected chance,
Than I unloos'd her tether and embark'd.
The moon was up, the Lake was shining clear
Among the hoary mountains; from the Shore
I push'd, and struck the oars and struck again
In cadence, and my little Boat mov'd on
Even like a Man who walks with stately step
Though bent on speed. It was an act of stealth
And troubled pleasure; not without the voice
Of mountain-echoes did my Boat move on,
Leaving behind her still on either side
Small circles glittering idly in the moon,
Until they melted all into one track
Of sparkling light. A rocky Steep uprose
Above the Cavern of the Willow tree
And now, as suited one who proudly row'd
With his best skill, I fix'd a steady view
Upon the top of that same craggy ridge,
The bound of the horizon, for behind
Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky.
She was an elfin Pinnace; lustily
I dipp'd my oars into the silent Lake,
And, as I rose upon the stroke, my Boat
Went heaving through the water, like a Swan;
When from behind that craggy Steep, till then
The bound of the horizon, a huge Cliff,
As if with voluntary power instinct,
Uprear'd its head. I struck, and struck again
And, growing still in stature, the huge Cliff
Rose up between me and the stars, and still,
With measur'd motion, like a living thing,
Strode after me. With trembling hands I turn'd,
And through the silent water stole my way
Back to the Cavern of the Willow tree.
There, in her mooring-place, I left my Bark,
And, through the meadows homeward went, with grave
And serious thoughts; and after I had seen
That spectacle, for many days, my brain
Work'd with a dim and undetermin'd sense
Of unknown modes of being; in my thoughts
There was a darkness, call it solitude,
Or blank desertion, no familiar shapes
Of hourly objects, images of trees,
Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields;
But huge and mighty Forms that do not live
Like living men mov'd slowly through the mind
By day and were the trouble of my dreams.
Wisdom and Spirit of the universe!
Thou Soul that art the eternity of thought!
That giv'st to forms and images a breath
And everlasting motion! not in vain,
By day or star-light thus from my first dawn
Of Childhood didst Thou intertwine for me
The passions that build up our human Soul,
Not with the mean and vulgar works of Man,
But with high objects, with enduring things,
With life and nature, purifying thus
The elements of feeling and of thought,
And sanctifying, by such discipline,
Both pain and fear, until we recognize
A grandeur in the beatings of the heart.
Nor was this fellowship vouchsaf'd to me
With stinted kindness. In November days,
When vapours, rolling down the valleys, made
A lonely scene more lonesome; among woods
At noon, and 'mid the calm of summer nights,
When, by the margin of the trembling Lake,
Beneath the gloomy hills I homeward went
In solitude, such intercourse was mine;
'Twas mine among the fields both day and night,
And by the waters all the summer long.
And in the frosty season, when the sun
Was set, and visible for many a mile
The cottage windows through the twilight blaz'd,
I heeded not the summons:--happy time
It was, indeed, for all of us; to me
It was a time of rapture: clear and loud
The village clock toll'd six; I wheel'd about,
Proud and exulting, like an untired horse,
That cares not for its home.--All shod with steel,
We hiss'd along the polish'd ice, in games
Confederate, imitative of the chace
And woodland pleasures, the resounding horn,
The Pack loud bellowing, and the hunted hare.
So through the darkness and the cold we flew,
And not a voice was idle; with the din,
Meanwhile, the precipices rang aloud,
The leafless trees, and every icy crag
Tinkled like iron, while the distant hills
Into the tumult sent an alien sound
Of melancholy, not unnoticed, while the stars,
Eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west
The orange sky of evening died away.
Not seldom from the uproar I retired
Into a silent bay, or sportively
Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng,
To cut across the image of a star
That gleam'd upon the ice: and oftentimes
When we had given our bodies to the wind,
And all the shadowy banks, on either side,
Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still
The rapid line of motion; then at once
Have I, reclining back upon my heels,
Stopp'd short, yet still the solitary Cliffs
Wheeled by me, even as if the earth had roll'd
With visible motion her diurnal round;
Behind me did they stretch in solemn train
Feebler and feebler, and I stood and watch'd
Till all was tranquil as a dreamless sleep.
Ye Presences of Nature, in the sky
And on the earth! Ye Visions of the hills!
And Souls of lonely places! can I think
A vulgar hope was yours when Ye employ'd
Such ministry, when Ye through many a year
Haunting me thus among my boyish sports,
On caves and trees, upon the woods and hills,
Impress'd upon all forms the characters
Of danger or desire, and thus did make
The surface of the universal earth
With triumph, and delight, and hope, and fear,
Work like a sea?       Not uselessly employ'd,
I might pursue this theme through every change
Of exercise and play, to which the year
Did summon us in its delightful round.
We were a noisy crew, the sun in heaven
Beheld not vales more beautiful than ours,
Nor saw a race in happiness and joy
More worthy of the ground where they were sown.
I would record with no reluctant voice
The woods of autumn and their hazel bowers
With milk-white clusters hung; the rod and line,
True symbol of the foolishness of hope,
Which with its strong enchantment led us on
By rocks and pools, shut out from every star
All the green summer, to forlorn cascades
Among the windings of the mountain brooks.
--Unfading recollections! at this hour
The heart is almost mine with which I felt
From some hill-top, on sunny afternoons
The Kite high up among the fleecy clouds
Pull at its rein, like an impatient Courser,
Or, from the meadows sent on gusty days,
Beheld her breast the wind, then suddenly
Dash'd headlong; and rejected by the storm.
Ye lowly Cottages in which we dwelt,
A ministration of your own was yours,
A sanctity, a safeguard, and a love!
Can I forget you, being as ye were
So beautiful among the pleasant fields
In which ye stood? Or can I here forget
The plain and seemly countenance with which
Ye dealt out your plain comforts? Yet had ye
Delights and exultations of your own.
Eager and never weary we pursued
Our home amusements by the warm peat-fire
At evening; when with pencil and with slate,
In square divisions parcell'd out, and all
With crosses and with cyphers scribbled o'er,
We schemed and puzzled, head opposed to head
In strife too humble to be named in Verse.
Or round the naked table, snow-white deal,
Cherry or maple, sate in close array,
And to the combat, Lu or Whist, led on
thick-ribbed Army; not as in the world
Neglected and ungratefully thrown by
Even for the very service they had wrought,
But husbanded through many a long campaign.
Uncouth assemblage was it, where no few
Had changed their functions, some, plebeian cards,
Which Fate beyond the promise of their birth
Had glorified, and call'd to represent
The persons of departed Potentates.
Oh! with what echoes on the Board they fell!
Ironic Diamonds, Clubs, Hearts, Diamonds, Spades,
A congregation piteously akin.
Cheap matter did they give to boyish wit,
Those sooty knaves, precipitated down
With scoffs and taunts, like Vulcan out of Heaven,
The paramount Ace, a moon in her eclipse,
Queens, gleaming through their splendour's last decay,
And Monarchs, surly at the wrongs sustain'd
By royal visages. Meanwhile, abroad
The heavy rain was falling, or the frost
Raged bitterly, with keen and silent tooth,
And, interrupting oft the impassion'd game,
From Esthwaite's neighbouring Lake the splitting ice,
While it sank down towards the water, sent,
Among the meadows and the hills, its long
And dismal yellings, like the noise of wolves
When they are howling round the Bothnic Main.
Nor, sedulous as I have been to trace
How Nature by extrinsic passion first
Peopled my mind with beauteous forms or grand,
And made me love them, may I well forget
How other pleasures have been mine, and joys
Of subtler origin; how I have felt,
Not seldom, even in that tempestuous time,
Those hallow'd and pure motions of the sense
Which seem, in their simplicity, to own
An intellectual charm, that calm delight
Which, if I err not, surely must belong
To those first-born affinities that fit
Our new existence to existing things,
And, in our dawn of being, constitute
The bond of union betwixt life and joy.
Yes, I remember, when the changeful earth,
And twice five seasons on my mind had stamp'd
The faces of the moving year, even then,
A Child, I held unconscious intercourse
With the eternal Beauty, drinking in
A pure organic pleasure from the lines
Of curling mist, or from the level plain
Of waters colour'd by the steady clouds.
The Sands of Westmoreland, the Creeks and Bays
Of Cumbria's rocky limits, they can tell
How when the Sea threw off his evening shade
And to the Shepherd's huts beneath the crags
Did send sweet notice of the rising moon,
How I have stood, to fancies such as these,
Engrafted in the tenderness of thought,
A stranger, linking with the spectacle
No conscious memory of a kindred sight,
And bringing with me no peculiar sense
Of quietness or peace, yet I have stood,
Even while mine eye has mov'd o'er three long leagues
Of shining water, gathering, as it seem'd,
Through every hair-breadth of that field of light,
New pleasure, like a bee among the flowers.
Thus, often in those fits of vulgar joy
Which, through all seasons, on a child's pursuits
Are prompt attendants, 'mid that giddy bliss
Which, like a tempest, works along the blood
And is forgotten; even then I felt
Gleams like the flashing of a shield; the earth
And common face of Nature spake to me
Rememberable things; sometimes, 'tis true,
By chance collisions and quaint accidents
Like those ill-sorted unions, work suppos'd
Of evil-minded fairies, yet not vain
Nor profitless, if haply they impress'd
Collateral objects and appearances,
Albeit lifeless then, and doom'd to sleep
Until maturer seasons call'd them forth
To impregnate and to elevate the mind.
--And if the vulgar joy by its own weight
Wearied itself out of the memory,
The scenes which were a witness of that joy
Remained, in their substantial lineaments
Depicted on the brain, and to the eye
Were visible, a daily sight; and thus
By the impressive discipline of fear,
By pleasure and repeated happiness,
So frequently repeated, and by force
Of obscure feelings representative
Of joys that were forgotten, these same scenes,
So beauteous and majestic in themselves,
Though yet the day was distant, did at length
Become habitually dear, and all
Their hues and forms were by invisible links
Allied to the affections.       I began
My story early, feeling as I fear,
The weakness of a human love, for days
Disown'd by memory, ere the birth of spring
Planting my snowdrops among winter snows.
Nor will it seem to thee, my Friend! so prompt
In sympathy, that I have lengthen'd out,
With fond and feeble tongue, a tedious tale.
Meanwhile, my hope has been that I might fetch
Invigorating thoughts from former years,
Might fix the wavering balance of my wind,
And haply meet reproaches, too, whose power
May spur me on, in manhood now mature,
To honorable toil. Yet should these hopes
Be vain, and thus should neither I be taught
To understand myself, nor thou to know
With better knowledge how the heart was fram'd
Of him thou lovest, need I dread from thee
Harsh judgments, if I am so loth to quit
Those recollected hours that have the charm
Of visionary things, and lovely forms
And sweet sensations that throw back our life
And almost make our Infancy itself
A visible scene, on which the sun is shining?
One end hereby at least hath been attain'd,
My mind hath been revived, and if this mood
Desert me not, I will forthwith bring down,
Through later years, the story of my life.
The road lies plain before me; 'tis a theme
Single and of determined bounds; and hence
I chuse it rather at this time, than work
Of ampler or more varied argument."
794,Emotion,SchoolPoemsIDonTWantToGoIntoSchoolPoembycolinmcnaughton,"I don't want to go into school today; Mum,
I don't feel like school work today.
Oh,  don't make me go to school today, Mum
Oh, please let me stay home and play.
But you must go to school, my cherub, my lamb,
If you don't it will be a disaster,
How would they manage without you, my sweet,
After all you are the headmaster!"
795,Emotion,SchoolPoemsAmongSchoolChildrenPoembyWilliamButlerYeats,"I WALK through the long schoolroom questioning;
A kind old nun in a white hood replies;
The children learn to cipher and to sing,
To study reading-books and histories,
To cut and sew, be neat in everything
In the best modern way -- the children's eyes
In momentary wonder stare upon
A sixty-year-old smiling public man.
I dream of a Ledaean body, bent
Above a sinking fire.  a tale that she
Told of a harsh reproof, or trivial event
That changed some childish day to tragedy --
Told, and it seemed that our two natures blent
Into a sphere from youthful sympathy,
Or else, to alter Plato's parable,
Into the yolk and white of the one shell.
III
And thinking of that fit of grief or rage
I look upon one child or t'other there
And wonder if she stood so at that age --
For even daughters of the swan can share
Something of every paddler's heritage --
And had that colour upon cheek or hair,
And thereupon my heart is driven wild:
She stands before me as a living child.
Her present image floats into the mind --
Did Quattrocento finger fashion it
Hollow of cheek as though it drank the wind
And took a mess of shadows for its meat?
And I though never of Ledaean kind
Had pretty plumage once -- enough of that,
Better to smile on all that smile, and show
There is a comfortable kind of old scarecrow.
What youthful mother, a shape upon her lap
Honey of generation had betrayed,
And that must sleep, shriek, struggle to escape
As recollection or the drug decide,
Would think her Son, did she but see that shape
With sixty or more winters on its head,
A compensation for the pang of his birth,
Or the uncertainty of his setting forth?
Plato thought nature but a spume that plays
Upon a ghostly paradigm of things;
Solider Aristotle played the taws
Upon the bottom of a king of kings;
World-famous golden-thighed Pythagoras
Fingered upon a fiddle-stick or strings
What a star sang and careless Muses heard:
Old clothes upon old sticks to scare a bird.
VII
Both nuns and mothers worship images,
But thos the candles light are not as those
That animate a mother's reveries,
But keep a marble or a bronze repose.
And yet they too break hearts -- O presences
That passion, piety or affection knows,
And that all heavenly glory symbolise --
O self-born mockers of man's enterprise;
VIII
Labour is blossoming or dancing where
The body is not bruised to pleasure soul.
Nor beauty born out of its own despair,
Nor blear-eyed wisdom out of midnight oil.
O chestnut-tree, great-rooted blossomer,
Are you the leaf, the blossom or the bole?
O body swayed to music, O brightening glance,
How can we know the dancer from the dance?"
796,Emotion,SchoolPoemsWalkingThroughHighSchoolPoembyHeatherHill,"This is it everything that you have gone through us now memories.
All of your happy and sad times in high school have now faded.
A new life has begun on your own.
No more waking up dreading that this day will never get here.
Now the day is here and your missing everyone before they even
walk through these high school doors.
Every memory is left unsaid.
On graduation day everyone cried, I even cried.
Knowing that I may never get to hang with my friends ever again.
Hoping they'll be here for my graduation crying with me."

799,Emotion,SchoolPoemsMyFirstDayAtSchoolaRealExperiencePoembyanjanaasok12yrs,"Oh, it came so fast like a speedy train,
in the month of heavy rain,
when the birds of joy just flew away,
and my heartbeat rose up each day.
the vacations were over and,
there was no more time to play in sand,
but of course you know what that was,
it was my school reopening day as it is.
That day morn when I woke up,
thought if i had a ever or hiccup,
lazy and unwilling, of course, of huss,
made it to the waiting bus.
As the speed of bus went high,
i sank back to the seat with a sigh,
at last whe i walked down to school,
i never knew to use what tool.
As my school came closer,
I became more more dozer,
but wait! now that at school i was,
noone knows the tension a girl has.
When i stepped in to my class,
My courage broke like a breaking glass,
but when i found out i wasn't alone,
and found news friends to adorn,
for first school became a heaven!
* when i was going on to my 5th class to a new school. of course i made a lot of friends and my shyness left me and i am now first at school"
